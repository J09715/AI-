["Q: Minimal Ubuntu Elementary OS Port Can anyone help in creating a Ubuntu with the following packages.\nDesktop Environment :Pantheon\nGTK Theme :eGTK\nIcon Theme :Moka Icon Theme\nTerminal :Pantheon-Terminal\nSettings :Switchboard\nFile Manager: Marlin/Pantheon-Files\nOr\nIn short the same apps are available in Elementary OS Luna but the base is Ubuntu 12.04 which is very old. Can anyone port Elementary OS Luna to Ubuntu 13.10 or Ubuntu 14.04\n\nA: \nCan anyone port Elementary OS Luna to Ubuntu 13.10 or Ubuntu 14.04\"\n\nNo, Elementary OS will never be ported to Ubuntu. Elementary OS is an OS in itself where someone took Ubuntu 12.04 and changed the code base and then published it as on OS named Elementary.\nYour question probably should be: can someone create a new version of Elementary OS based of of Ubuntu 13.04 or 13.10. On elementaryos.org there was a topic about this with this as an answer (no idea how official this is):\n\nWill we see an intermediate release based on 13.10?\nSince for the time being devs have to develop Isis of off 13.10 while waiting for 14.04 to mature, and since 14.04 won’t be finalized until mid-April 2014, will we see a surprise intermediate release of elementary based off of 13.10? elementary OS 0.2.5…?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe devs are using Ubuntu 12.04 as that base, sometime after 14.04 LTS is released “Isis” will be released with 14.04 as the new base\n\nAlso (from elementaryos.org/answers/which-ubuntu-version-is-elementary-os-luna-built-on, which is now a broken link):\n\nIt is based off Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. So far all elementary versions are based of the Ubuntu LTS versions.\n\nSo this system will be going from LTS to LTS and not have releases in between.\n", "Q: how to logout from terminal in 13.10? I have seen some previous post about logout from terminal but those were for old versions. I didnt find the way for logout in Ubuntu 13.10 from terminal.\nHow can I logout from terminal in Ubuntu 13.10 ?\n\nA: I usually do a killall -u <your-user-name> to stop my current session and clean-up any remaining processes of mine.\n\nA: If you are in a gnome / unity environment, you could use the gnome-session-quit command, you could use gnome-session-quit --no-prompt if you don't want to choose between lock or logout.\nIf you are in a pure terminal (no X-environment) exit should do the trick\n\nA: You can use dbus signal to logout from the desktop, with dbus-send:\ndbus-send --session --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=org.gnome.SessionManager /org/gnome/SessionManager org.gnome.SessionManager.Logout uint32:1\n\nTested with gnome and unity.\n\nA: gnome-session-quit --no-prompt will log you out of an existing Unity session, without a prompt.\n", "Q: Xubuntu 13.04 HDMI sound Problem I am having an issue with HDMI audio output with xubuntu 13.04. I did a clean install, downloaded updates after installation, am currently on kernel 3.8.0-33-generic. I have checked, and reloaded alsamixer and pulseaudio. \nThe pulseaudio shows that there is an output signal for HDMI but I have no sound. I cannot find any other helpful info. \nI am new to xubuntu, is there anything that I have missed? \nMy desktop had an AMD a6 3620 APU.\n\nA: So if in Audio, Output you click on your HDMI output, you can't test it at all?\nTry having a look here\neven if the link is for a different version, the problme stills the same.\nhave a look the the first of comments about the command line to call the kernel..\n\nA: If you have a dedicated graphics card, HDMI is most probably controlled through that.\nCheck if you're using the default open source drivers or the proprietary ones (these usually have better hdni support, and generally are more performant). Use the 'lshw' to list your hardware devices.\nCheck these out if you're planning on installing these drivers:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia\n", "Q: setup Gitlab CI I have setup Gitlab in ubuntu server, it's working fine.

Ubuntu One is the single-sign-on service for Ubuntu, as well as providing other services such as file sync and music streaming, if you choose to use those services. You are not required to use the additional services if you don't want to use them.\nHowever, in order to purchase any apps, or access the previously purchased app features of Software Center, you will need to log in to the Ubuntu One service. The e-mail address and password will be the same one you use to log in to Launchpad or which you have used in the past for Software Center, though.\n", "Q: command line syntax that will show MySQL details Is there a command-line syntax that will show details about my installed MySQL (eg. ports, config file paths, etc.)?\n\nA: Server System Variables\n\n\n*\n\n*To see the values that a server will use based on its compiled-in defaults and any option files that it reads, use this command:\nmysqld --verbose --help\n\n\n*To see the values that a server will use based on its compiled-in defaults, ignoring the settings in any option files, use this command:\nmysqld --no-defaults --verbose --help\n\n\n*Inside MySQL SHOW VARIABLES will show the current settings MySQL is using. Here is a list of variables.\n\n*Inside MySQL status will show information about the install (collation, threads, slow queries and more).\n\nBesides that you can also have a look at /etc/mysql/my.cnf. That file is used to store settings. It holds the port, pid file location, socket etc. Example showing the port number: \nmore /etc/mysql/my.cnf | grep port\nport            = 3306\nport            = 3306\n\n", "Q: Monitor disk usage changes to infer download speed I'm testing various solutions for downloading large datasets, downloads which can take weeks and require several restarts. Instead of monitoring network speed, I'd like to use the change in disk usage to infer download speeds, since this will avoid measuring re-transmission of failed transfers. Is there a tool to do this, or should I roll my own bash solution?\n\nA: Coreutils are well suited to this kind of thing. Here is a quick solution that will also save the dates and times.\n$ echo -e \"$(date)\\t$(df | awk '$1 == \"/dev/sda1\" {print $2}')\" > df_1\n<wait a while>\n$ echo -e \"$(date)\\t$(df | awk '$1 == \"/dev/sda1\" {print $2}')\" > df_2\n$ echo \"$(( $(awk '{print $2}' FS='\\t' df_2) - $(awk '{print $2}' FS='\\t' df_1) )) K increase from $(awk '{print $1}' FS='\\t' df_1) to $(awk '{print $1}' FS='\\t' df_2)\"\n12 K increase from Wed Nov 20 21:22:07 EST 2013 to Wed Nov 20 21:23:13 EST 2013\n\nI'm not sure if you need this, but to explain what it does:\n\n\n*\n\n*Firstly, save the current date and time (date), and \"used\" disk space (awk '$1 == \"/dev/sda1\" {print $2}') into the file df_1. You might need to substitute your specific file system instead of /dev/sda1. Use df alone to get a list.\n\n*Secondly, repeat at a later date.\n\n*Finally, print out the difference between the \"used\" disk space $((...)), which was stored in the first field of each file, and print out the dates (from the second field).\n\n\nA: Sparhawk beat me to it, but here's my own solution, which I intended to run as a cron job\n#!/bin/bash\ntimestamp1=$(cat du-prev.txt | cut -f 2)\ntimestamp2=$(date +\"%s\")\ntimediff=$(echo \"${timestamp2}-${timestamp1}\" | bc)\n\ncurrent=$(du -s | cut -f 1)\nprevious=$(cat du-prev.txt | cut -f 1)\nspacediff=$(echo \"${current}-${previous}\" | bc)\n\nspeed=$(echo \"scale=2; ((${spacediff}/${timediff})*8)/1024\" | bc)\n\necho \"timediff   : ${timediff} sec\"\necho \"spacediff  : ${spacediff} KB\"\necho \"speed      : ${speed} Mb/s\"\necho -e \"${current}\\t${timestamp2}\" > du-prev.txt\necho -e \"${speed}\\t${timestamp2}\" >> logs/speedlog.txt\n\n", "Q: I want to boot ubuntu-12.04 with USB I am using ubuntu-9.04.I want to install the new version of Ubuntu.\nSo I download the new version and insert it in the USB by using startup disk creator but when I go to boot it from usb it shows :\n'SYSLINUX 3.63...........Unknown keyword in configuration file\nboot:\n_ '\n\nWhat should I do ?\n\nA: There's something wrong with the files in your usb, namely, the 'boot' file.\nReformatting your usb and creating it again should fix it.\nIf it doesn't, try using some other boot disk creator like Rufus or UNetbootin.\nhttp://rufus.akeo.ie/\nhttp://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/\n", "Q: Two-factor authentication on Ubuntu One Is there a way to enable two-factor authentication to access my Ubuntu One account?\n\nA: Two factor authentication is still in beta, but you can follow the FAQ at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSO/FAQs/2FA to request access to the beta.\nThis will allow you to enable the two factor requirement to access all web sites, but some client code does not support two factor yet.\n", "Q: make all error while installing htk I am getting error in make all while installing htk :\n(cd HTKLib && make HTKLib.a) \\\n      || case \"\" in *k*) fail=yes;; *) exit 1;; esac;\nmake[1]: Entering directory `/home/dushyant/HTK/htk/HTKLib'\ngcc  -m32 -ansi -D_SVID_SOURCE -DOSS_AUDIO -D'ARCH=\"x86_64\"' -Wall -Wno-switch -g -O2 -I. -DPHNALG   -c -o HGraf.o HGraf.c\nIn file included from /usr/include/stdio.h:28:0,\n                 from HShell.h:40,\n                 from HGraf.c:54:\n/usr/include/features.h:324:26: fatal error: bits/predefs.h: No such file or directory\ncompilation terminated.\nmake[1]: *** [HGraf.o] Error 1\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/home/dushyant/HTK/htk/HTKLib'\nmake: *** [HTKLib/HTKLib.a] Error 1\n\nWhat should I do ?\n\nA: That header bits/predefs.h comes with libc6-dev-i386 (32bit headers).

I have installed the UBUNTU in other partition to work as dual boot. I am trying now to restore the factory settings with ALT + F10 which is not working any more. Each time its giving me screen to choose operating system. How do I restore my system now?\n\nA: I assume you want to delete Ubuntu and  restore Windows to original state (factory settings)? \nNote that I'm not familiar with Vaio, however on boot screen (grub) you should be able to see installed systems. For Windows you should have more than one entry and the first one sda/dev1 (or similar most likely) is rescue partition of Windows. Boot there and  follow to guide to re-install Windows.\nHope it solve your problem.\n\nA: I'm not familiar with Vaio in particular, but these days most computers come with a hidden 'rescue' partition that's used to 'restore factory settings'. That it doesn't work for you could indicate that you have deleted this partition (perhaps when installing Ubuntu).\nTake a look at the partition table (eg. with gparted) and check if there's an extra partition you don't use; it'll probably be 10-20 GiB in size, and may be hidden, labeled 'Rescue' or somesuch, and formatted with either NTFS or FAT. If it's there, try editing your grub configuration to show it as a boot option from the menu -- perhaps it's just that the BIOS is confused by the partition layout, but if you boot it directly it'll work fine.\nIf it isn't there, then the only way to reimage the system ('restore to factory settings') is to use an external rescue media you probably could have made on first Windows boot. If you don't have it, I'm afraid you need to contact Sony tech support.\n\nA: You should go through answers of  question How to remove Ubuntu and put Windows back on? before proceeding. I believe you will be redirected to the correct way to do it after referring to this question.\n", "Q: Program to repair grub?

I'm thinking about building myself a LackRack from Ikea furniture and putting it there with a maintenance monitor-keyboard setup.\nMy main computer is a Windows OS, so I will use OpenSSH and Putty whenever I can.\nThe reason I'm leaning a bit towards desktop version is that with the GUI, it's probably a bit easier to have control and organization over the system.\n\nA: Whatever you want ;)\nFor me the decision would be if the system is actually a server. A server to me is headless (so no monitor) and is intended for more than 1 person to connect to. Like it is holding your website or you provide an sftp service to people you know. \nIf you intend this to be a machine where you want to use it for yourself I would go for a desktop with software installed that you need. \nSetting up a server from a desktop is probably easier to do and easier to maintain than setting up a server from the server install. That last one will be cleaner and since a server is about delivering results to clients fast cleaner is better. \n", "Q: How to turn off hard drive when booting from USB? I want to install Ubuntu on a USB drive and found these instructions here.\nI want to do this, because I want to use my laptop when I am in a car or when I walk. So, I want to turn off my hard drive when booting from USB to prevent it to cause bad sectors, etc.\nNow my question is: how to manually turn off the hard drive when booting from USB? Or, does it turn off when isn't in use or being mounted?\n\nA: Here are the steps to take your hard disk to enter standby mode (or to sleep mode). This gets HDD to spin down and park the heads to landing zones so that the chances of a head crash is nullified.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot the Ubuntu liveCD/DVD/USB.\n\n*If the HDD that you're trying to take to standby mode has a swap-partition (likely if you have Ubuntu installed in your HDD as well), turn it off.\nsudo swapoff -a (This turns off all devices marked as swap)\n\n*Now to make your HDD enter low power consumption standby mode:\nsudo hdparm -y /dev/sdX where sdX is the target HDD, and X in sdX should be replaced appropriately (with a, b, c, ..., z); assuming it to be sda, the command would look like this: sudo hdparm -y /dev/sda\nOr you could make your HDD enter the lowest power consumption sleep mode, causing it to shut down completely with:\nsudo hdparm -Y /dev/sdX (sdX should be the target device)\nThat's it! You can then continue using your live Ubuntu session.\n(Note: Modern laptops use \"self-park\" for better & safe portability.)\n\nPS. This method of putting a HDD to standby mode can prove helpful also when you want to be a little economical on power consumption. Especially in desktop computers, if you have more that one internal HDDs, you can power down those which you use very less than often.\n", "Q: I cannot format my flash usb stick - newby user I have the latest edition of ubuntu, formated my pc 1 week ago.\nI Right clicked on the USB flash partition and I sow the format option.

I used to run commands like: find /dev | grep sd* to output a list of all the drives attached to my computer. It appears that I now have to add any random character before the star in order to get the same affect as shown below:\n\nI tested this on various Ubuntu 12.04 servers and got the same effect, so I do not think this is just something random on my desktop. Is this a new change, a bug, or has it always been this way and my memory needs replacing?\n\nA: You have two problems: \n\n\n*\n\n*Globbing interferes with your regexp\n\n*Your regexp doesn't match what is should match\n\n\nUncovering the globbing mechanism\nsudo find /dev | grep sd* doesn't work as before because you have a file or a folder in your current working directory which triggers the globbing from bash. Add a echo in front of your command to see what globbing does to your command\necho grep sd*\n\nBy adding a random additional character, globbing didn't match the file/folder anymore and grep continued to work as expected.\nHow to prevent globbing\nTo prevent globbing from kicking in, you have to put '...' around your term.  (Double quotes will work also.) This will make grep behave as before:\nsudo find /dev | grep 'sd*'\n\nHow regular expressions work\nNow that the regexp is working as expected let's look at what * means in regular expressions as opposed to file globbing.  In short it means \"This last character zero or n-times\" and this is most probably not what you want.  Using 'sd*' you might see /dev/stdout in the output, since stdout starts with an s followed by zero or more d's.\nIn your case a simple:\nsudo find /dev | grep sd\n\nshould be all you need to match.\n\nOr, of course, you could just run one of the following commands (which use file glob patterns, not regular expressions) to give you the same output:\nfind /dev -name 'sd*'\nls -1 /dev/sd*\n\n", "Q: Can I restore applications settings from a back up of Ubuntu on a fresh install Lubuntu? (same machine) And in general, I'm wondering if this is possible as I switch between Ubuntu derivatives? (or even Linux distro)\n\nA: The question is a bit generic, so the answer is a bit generic, too: yes, probably.\nMost applications save their settings either \n\n\n*\n\n*in a hidden subdirectory of your home directory named after the application, e.g. ~/.thunderbird,\n\n*in a directory in ~/.config/, e.g. ~/.config/evolution, or\n\n*in a hidden file in your home directory, again named after the application, with an append rc, e.g. ~/.vimrc\nIf you locate the appropriate directory or file and copy it to your new home, the application will (usually) use those restored settings.\nUpdate: Changing the hardware doesn't matter as long as the configuration is not specific to that hardware – most configs are not, though.\nA different user name might cause problems if the config uses full paths – like /home/olduser/.something – instead of paths relative to the current user's home.\nAlso, on a new installation, the user id might differ, so make sure the files belong to your new user.\nIn a nutshell, changing the hardware and/or the user id might introduce some small problems, but nothing that can't rather easily be dealt with.\n\nA: To add to the drc's (correct) answer, you can even switch from boot to boot if you have the root partition and the /home partition on different places. (See for example my answer here]1). \nWarning: this is advanced user material. Don't do it if you are not confident. Have a backup of your data every time. \nI mean, for example: you can have a / for Ubuntu on /dev/sda5, a / for Fedora on /dev/sda6, and a common /home for both on /dev/sda6. Then you can choose where to boot each time. \nIt's tricky but (at least used to) work. I had it when switched from Mandriva to Ubuntu ages ago. The main pitfalls/warnings are:\n\n\n*\n\n*if you are using the same user name, you must be sure that UID and GID are the same for the two systems; \n\n*sometime configuration files for programs are not forward/backward compatible, which can create problems switching.\nBut it's basically a lot of fun. You can have even (more advanced matter) \n\n\n*\n\n*different user names for every system with the same UID (each system has a completely different configuration but you can access your files) \n\n*you can even play with chroot and having the two system available together without virtual machines... (I tried just the command line  part. Graphic console is probably impossible to have without some kind of real virtualization.). \n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut for input language change works in only one direction I Use 64-bit ubuntu Gnome 13.10. Currently I have 2 input languages: English and Russian. When I wanted to switch between them I use standard Alt-Shift shortcut. When the Russian is selected Alt-Shift works fine, but the switchback is impossible. When I use GUI for switching it works fine:\nI want to make switching in both directions possible using not only GUI but keyboard shortcuts too. How can I fix this?\n\nA: You open System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts (tab) -> Typing (sidebar tab) you change either the \"Switch to next source\" or the \"Switch to previous source\". \nBy default I think the shortcut for the next source is Super + Space. Super Key stands for the Windows button in case you are using a pc / laptop and in Mac is the cmd button.\n", "Q: How boot to terminal Ubuntu 12.04 MacbookPro I tried to boot into terminal with ctrl+alt+t in my ubuntu 12.04 mbp, but it always boot into GUI. \nHow can I fix this ?\n\nA: Ctrl+Alt+T doesn't boot into the terminal, just calls the gnome-terminal application.\nIf what you mean is you want to log in to a tty, try Ctrl+Alt+F# (where # is a value between 2 and 6) For instance, Ctrl+Alt+F6.\nYou can go back to the GUI with Ctrl+Alt+F7.\n", "Q: Is it possible to uninstall the 'programs' rm, cp and mv from the system? I can't see how this would be useful, but I'm really interested.\nIs it possible to uninstall the programs rm, cp and mv?\n\nA: All the Ubuntu meta-packages, all the way down to ubuntu-minimal indirectly depend on coreutils (which these are part of)... There isn't really to properly uninstall them because everything else needs them.\nAnd what's to stop somebody bringing their own tools? I could, for example, write a version of cp in Python in a few minutes. If you're trying to lock things down, it might make most sense to ask yourself \"What damage could this user do?\" then fixing that rather than papering over the holes with obscurity.\nIf you need certain files to not be damaged, fix their permissions. You've got a few options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount them as readonly from another location \n\n*Make them owned by a different account and give global read access (chmod 744 for example)\n\n*Use acl (access control list - like the chmod permission on steroids) for granular permissions over lots of users)\n\n*Imaging and reimaging on reboot and netbooting to restore to a known-working system on boot.\n\n\nYou can use a lot of this stuff together but chances are if you remove something (aside from the technical arguments) you're just inconveniencing the people that really need the tools. Those with nefarious intentions are more than well equipped enough to work around simple blocks.\n\nA: Those programs are part of the package coreutils, which is depended upon by so many packages, that while you could  force your package manager to uninstall it, it would break your whole system and thus is utterly pointless.\ntl;dr: Don't even try.\n", "Q: Strange Brasero Problem I was trying to burn a copy of the Zorin OS iso to a DVD+R in Brasero.

CHECK THE MD5SUM on your Ubuntu ISO before you delete OS X!\nAs a safer option, you might try partitioning your drive in disk utility and dual-booting.  If you're asking this question you probably shouldn't be single-booting Linux.  It's the sad truth that PC makers still don't necessarily take Linux users into account when releasing firmware upgrades, and there's a minor chance you will at some point want some other OS on there as a backup.  I wish that were not the case and it's pretty rare, but it is a risk.  There are plenty of users who know enough they can get away with single-booting a linux distro, but I am not one of them.  (For example, as far as I know the only way to set up an Airport device is through OS X...I can use it in Ubuntu but for the initial setup I have to go through the Mac interface.)\n", "Q: How do I fix boot problems after installing 12.04 alongside Windows 8? I'm a long-time windows user trying to convert to Ubuntu. I think I messed up the installation pretty badly and I'm not sure how to fix it. I will try to be as detailed as possible:\nI recently bought an Acer aspire netbook that came pre-loaded with windows 8. I wanted to have a dual-booting Windows 8 and Ubuntu set up. I followed these instructions to install Ubuntu alongside Windows. \nAs per the article, I shrunk the main partition in Windows 8, and downloaded Ubuntu 12.04 onto a USB stick. I changed my boot settings to go into Legacy Mode, so as to turn off secure boot (I can't turn it off in UEFI mode), and instructed it to boot from the USB stick.   \nOpening the live version, I installed Ubuntu on manually created partitions, as the installer didn't recognize windows 8. Again following the article's instructions, I created 2 ext4 partitions and a swap partition using the free space.\nI got an error saying something about needing a ~1MB partition (was either for boot or bios, I forget the exact wording) for Ubuntu to run properly. I had 1MB of free space in my list of disk partitions, so I assigned 1MB partition to that and moved along.\nAfter fully installing Ubuntu, I rebooted and unplugged the USB stick, and the computer directly booted into Ubuntu. No big deal, the article said this could happen, and I just needed to tinker with the boot settings. I ran boot repair, and followed the instructions in the boot repair report its instructions. \nAfter rebooting, I can't access either Ubuntu or Windows 8, from legacy mode or UEFI mode. I get error: invalid arch independent ELF magic. The only thing I can do is load the live version from the USB stick in Legacy Mode.\nHow I can resolve this Issue ?\nI know that there's a lot of threads about this error message, but there are so many variables with the installation I have a hard time telling which solutions are applicable, and I don't want to mess anything up further.\nPlease pardon any ignorance, this is my first experience with Linux and I feel like I'm not off to a great start.\n\nA: First, I suggest you look harder for options to disable Secure Boot without activating BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. Such an option should be present. If it's not, the manufacturer is pushing pretty hard at the limits of their contract with Microsoft, and possibly violating it. Personally, I would return any computer that doesn't enable me to disable Secure Boot, and I strongly recommend you do the same, if that's the case for you. (Note that a firmware update might help on this score, although some manufacturers require you to boot Windows to install such updates, which puts you in a bind.)\nTrying to manage Ubuntu booting in BIOS mode and Windows booting in EFI mode is a tricky proposition, so your goal should be to get both OSes installed in a single mode. This is usually easier with EFI mode, assuming you're starting with a working pre-installed Windows 8; however, BIOS mode may be easier if you've got a Windows 8 retail disc.\nYou may want to read my Web site on EFI-mode Linux installations. It's got assorted tips on how to prepare to install, install, and manage Linux on an EFI-based computer. This won't help you directly with your problem, but it's useful background information, and it may be helpful if you decide to start over from scratch.\nWhich brings me to your current recovery options. Starting from scratch is one of them, and it may be worth considering. Unfortunately, most manufacturers don't provide recovery CDs; instead, they rely on a recovery partition on the hard disk. You may be able to get that started, but you'll have to find your firmware's boot manager to launch it. When you run it, you can restore the computer to its factory defaults and start over from scratch, doing an EFI-based installation. Given your experience, I'd avoid using Boot Repair on your computer.\nAnother option is to try booting my rEFInd boot manager. Grab the CD-R or USB flash drive image, create a boot medium, and boot with it. Ideally, it will give you options to boot both Linux and Windows, both of which will work. Unfortunately, the images I've provided don't directly support Secure Boot, so you'll need to figure out how to disable it before using them. Alternatively, you could add Secure Boot support to the USB flash drive image by adding the shim program -- you'd need to rename EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi on the USB flash drive to EFI/BOOT/grubx64.efi and then put shim.efi on it as EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi. See the rEFInd Secure Boot documentation for more on this topic.\nAddition: You may want to file a bug report against Boot Repair, since it actually damaged a working installation.\n\nA: You originally installed in BIOS mode. Boot-Repair then converted your install to UEFI, but also renamed files.\nYou need to undo the Boot-Repair rename. It does that for \"buggy\" UEFI but often is not required. But then if you cannot boot ubuntu/grub then you cannot directly boot Windows from UEFI.\nTo undo & to rename files to their original names, you just need to tick the \"Restore EFI backups\" option of Boot-Repair. \nRestore backup of WinEFI or UEFI (not sure) that boot-repair made\nThat should get you back to booting Windows.\nSome details from a user with an Aspire. He says to run Boot-Repair but do not run the rename & backup. It seems your system will boot in UEFI or BIOS mode just depending on what you select from menu.\nHow to install Ubuntu for dual-boot with Windows 8 on Acer Aspire V5-551G.

It is a binary file about 1kB in size.  When I try to open in a text editor (gedit), I get an error message that there are invalid characters (UTF-8).\nI know what .gnupg/rnd is, but this isn't .gnupg/rnd it's just .rnd.  Also I haven't done anything that I can think of to create a gnupg key, at least not on purpose.\nAnyone know what this baby is?  I backup nightly and this file appeared a couple days ago.  I have run update since then.  I realize I could delete the file and see what happens, but I'd rather not go around kicking the tires on my machine if I don't have to.\nRunning Ubuntu 13.04, if that matters.\n\nA: This file is used to see the entropy when using cryptographic tools, e.g. OpenSSL. You can safely delete it and there's no need to backup it.\nSo, why do we have it then? On most systems we don't have a lot of activity we can use as a random source and to speed up the process for generating random enough cryptographic keys, this file contains previously collected random entropy, helping in seeding. So this file is not the sole source for entropy.\nAnd because it contains raw random data, you can't open it with a text editor. It's simply not encoded within the standard character sets, so a text editor doesn't know how to display it.\nIt should be readable only by the user itself, in mode 0600. If it's owned by root, you probably have run some sudo commands which keeps the $HOME variable to your regular user account. Just remove the file in that case, I'd say, as the user itself should be able to update this file.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*manpage of rand(1):\n\nThe rand command outputs num pseudo-random bytes after seeding the\nrandom number generator once.  As in other openssl command line tools,\nPRNG seeding uses the file $HOME/.rnd or .rnd in addition to the files\ngiven in the -rand option.  A new $HOME/.rnd or .rnd file will be\nwritten back if enough seeding was obtained from these sources.\n\n\n\n*OpenSSL FAQ: Why do I get a \"PRNG not seeded\" error message?\n", "Q: Short life battery I have a Lenovo Y480 and, after install Ubuntu 12.04, the life of battery is too short, I mean, when I use the other OS, it could be have a life for almost 6 hours, and when I use Ubuntu, it have a life no more than 1.5 hours.\nHow can I fix this issue?\nThanks!!!\n\nA: I came across this website some time ago.

I left the computer for a while and when I came back the screensaver had started, and locked the computer. Now it asks for a password to log in to the guest account. I don't have to write a password when I logged in as guest. How do I enter my current guest session without restarting the computer?\n\nA: Press \"Switch User\" and then log in from there.\n\nA: If the round-trip via \"Switch User\" brings you back to the password prompt as in Kubuntu after suspend2RAM, login as root and issue the following to a console:\n$ users\n\nwill print the eligible login-names currently logged in.\n$ sudo passwd guest-SLHiTY\n\nOf course you must adjust the random letters at the end to your temporary guest account. Next you are asked for the root password. Thereafter you can specify a new guest password and repeat it.\nNow switch back to the guest session (Ctrl-Alt-F7 or F8) and use the new password to get back into the guest session. It seems impossible to give an empty password this way but any three letters will do. Of course the new Password will be forgotten once you log out the guest, as this will completely remove the guest altogether.\n", "Q: lightdm/unity-greeter wallpaper will not set I am trying to set the wallpaper on my login screen, but i cant seem to get anything to stick.  I have used gsettings set com.canonical.unity-greeter background '/path/to/pic.jpg' as user 'lightdm'. However, i then get the output (process:6517): dconf-CRITICAL **: unable to create directory '/run/user/1000/dconf': Permission denied.  dconf will not work properly. Any ideas? Thanks\n\nA: I found a solution.  Though it displays an error message, the lightdm background does in fact change to whatever new background image you set.  \nOpen a terminal and get root\nsudo -i\n\n(Type sudo password)\nAllow the user lightdm to create a connection to the X server \nxhost +SI:localuser:lightdm\n\nSwitch user to lightdm.  I had to use sudo to do this, other guides do not do so. \nsudo su lightdm -s /bin/bash\n\nMake sure you have turned off the option to dynamically change lightdm's background to match the user's desktop background.  \ngsettings set com.canonical.unity-greeter draw-user-backgrounds 'false'\n\nFinally, set your desired lightdm background.  \ngsettings set com.canonical.unity-greeter background '/path/to/your/background.png'\n\nThis returns an error about dconf, ignore it. The new lightdm background should be present when you log out.  To double check, you can run \nexit\n\ntwice, once to get out of lightdm and once to get out of root.  Then run \ngsettings get com.canonical.unity-greeter background\n\nWhich should return the path of the image you chose.  Similarly, running \ndconf-editor\n\nGets you to a nice GUI.  Choosing the drop-down for com, then canonical, then unity-greeter lets you check the path of lightdm's background image, and should allow you to edit it as well but I was never able to make a valid change from there. \nHope this helps.  \nEDIT: running \ngsettings get com.canonical.unity-greeter background\n\nafter logging out does NOT return the new image path, but when lightdm is next used, the correct new image is set.  I know there's a way to run lightdm in test mode, which may be a more accurate way to test if the new background is set. I did not test that method, as the above method I used to change the background image worked for me.  \n", "Q: Why isn't python featured?

I need to extract these lines from the file; however, there are numbers in between that I do not know and the lines can vary. For instance, there are lines that may look like:\nphrase1 654654 phrase2\nphrase1 22 phrase2\nphrase1 949 phrase2\n\netc. \n\nHowever, I do know that I can write a code specifically for a particular line. For instance, I can write for line 2 above the following to find it: \ngrep \"phrase1 [0-9][0-9] phrase2\" file\n\nWhat code can I write using grep (or similar) in order to extract all the lines containing both phrase1 and phrase2 without knowing the numbers, or anything else for that matter, in between?\n\nA: Two methods: with regular expressions: \ngrep \"phrase1 .* phrase2\" file\n\nThis search for phrase1, one space, a string of characters that could be whatever you want, another space, and the phrase2, anywhere in the line (it matches lines that have more material before \"phrase1\" and after \"phrase2\")\nIf the two phrases have to be at the start and end of the line, see @AndreasT answer: you can use ^ and $ to \"anchor\" the regular expression at the start and end of the line.\nIf you want to match just numbers between the two phrases, the answer by minerz029 is the correct one; \"[0-9]+\" matches a repetition of digit (\"+\" means \"a sequence of at least one character\"). \nIf you want just numbers and phrase1 and phrase2 must be at the start and end of the phrase, combine the twos:\ngrep \"^phrase1 [0-9]+ phrase2$\" file\n\nOr the \"trick\"/hack...\ngrep \"phrase1\" file | grep \"phrase2\"\n\nExplication: the first command search for all the occurences of phrase1, then \"pipes\" the resulting lines as input to the second grep, that outputs all the lines that matches phrase2. \nHowever, as noticed by @AndreasT, this second method matches the reversed \"phrase2...phrase1\" pattern, which could be unwanted.\n\nA: If the lines you are looking for start with phrase1 and end with phrase2, then I would suggest\ngrep \"^phrase1.*phrase2$\"\n\nHere is a list of the special characters used\n\n\n*\n\n*^ matches the beginning of a line\n\n*$ matches the end of a line\n\n*. matches every character\n\n** matches 0 or more occurrences of the previous character\n\n\nSo, basically, grep looks for lines beginning with phrase1, followed by 0 or more characters and ending with phrase2.\n\nA: Use this to detect only digits in between the phrases:\ngrep -E '^phrase1 [0-9]+ phrase2$'\n\nThe -E option uses \"Extended regular expressions\", adding support for the + operator.\nBreakdown:\n\n\n*\n\n*^ means to match the start of the line.\n\n*+ after the [0-9] means to search for one or more occurrences of the preceding expression, which in this case is the class [0-9]. \n\n*$ means to match the end of the line.\n\n", "Q: Incorrect CPU clock speed?

I've forked rEFIt as rEFInd, and recent versions include an updated version of gptsync (as an EFI application; it doesn't currently work when compiled as a Linux application). To use my gptsync in rEFInd, though, you must both install the gptsync_{arch}.efi program file and edit the showtools line in refind.conf to enable the gptsync option. This hoop-jumping is deliberate for the following reason:\n\n*Hybrid MBRs, which is what gptsync creates, are flaky and dangerous. It's best to avoid them unless you need them, which on a Mac you do need in order to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. You also need them to boot Windows on a Mac, except for Windows 8 on some models, and Windows 7 if you jump through a lot of hoops. There are alternatives to a BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode boot, though....\n\n*Although booting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode is sometimes necessary, it's often better to boot Linux in EFI mode. In fact, this is one of the reasons I created rEFInd; it can boot a Linux kernel (version 3.3.0 or later) in EFI mode without using GRUB or any other boot loader. You'll need to have an EFI filesystem driver for whatever filesystem holds your kernel, though. (Several come with rEFInd.) Alternatively, you can install any other EFI boot loader you like to boot in EFI mode rather than in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\n\n*Could you elaborate on your statement that \"Tux shows up in the menu, but freezes on load when choosing this option?\" Are you referring to the rEFIt menu or some other menu? When you select the option, does anything happen before the freeze -- for instance, do you see a GRUB menu, does the screen change color, or do you see any text (even briefly)? Details such as these are vital for diagnosing problems.\n\n", "Q: How to close Teamviewer automatically? I can launch Teamviewer from a script. I can start/stop/restart the daemon, also.

I had a laptop and that's all.\nI was dual booting Ubuntu 13.10 and window 7, but recently Windows failed and needed a recovery disk.\nI am trying to make a Windows 7 recovery USB disk in Ubuntu.\nI see the \"Startup Disk Creator\" to use an ISO file to make the USB. Does Startup Disk Creator work with a Windows .iso file?\nThe complicated way is use the \"WinToFlash\" in the Wine emulator.\nAny advice?\n\nA: Yes indeed, startup disk creatos is exclusive to Ubuntu and it's flavors and you can neither use unetbootin since it's only for linux distros.\nI manage to boot a windows7 install iso using MultiBoot wich installs grub in your USB stick and it's also useful to have various live systems (or a persistent installation if you want).\nMain page http://liveusb.info/dotclear/\nInstructions to install http://liveusb.info/dotclear/index.php?pages/install\nThe site is in french buth the commands in the instructions should be easy to follow. you can (1) add the repository and install it from there, (2) download an ISO, (3) download and run a script.\nIt's pretty easy to use, just drag and drop the ISO.

If you want to ignore directories named classes for example, then simply use \\Aclasses\\Z as the expression. You also cannot ignore explicit paths, as only the base name of the path will be compared to the expression. Thus if you want to ignore ~/Ubuntu One/some/folder you will have to only ignore \\Afolder\\Z, which will ignore anything in Ubuntu One, with the name of folder.\n", "Q: How to Clone Ubuntu installed on USB stick onto PC HDD?

I installed 12.04, which runs Unity. I decided to try Gnome 13.10. My PC did not particularly like Gnome so I decided to switch back to Unity with a fresh re-install, hoping any issues would be eradicated. It seems to have worked okay.\nMy issue is the following: When reinstalling Unity after installing Gnome, it didn't recognise Gnome - instead, it thought there was no OS installed. I decided to use the \"Something else\" installation and removed the partitions and made three: / (15GB), swap (4GB) and /home (the rest of the space). With this in mind, I was wondering whether the Unity installation would completely remove Gnome. \nDoes the re-install wipe the disk ? \nI noticed some of the other posts discussed running the LiveCD and using terminal for dd if=dev/zero of=/dev/[hard drive name]. So, what should I do to make sure the hard disk is as new ?  \nReinstall Unity from the CD using the erase disk option again? Use the LiveCD terminal for some function, or do you think, despite not recognising Gnome, that the fresh reinstall is sufficient ?\nAny help would be much appreciated, I found similar posts but none with this specific issue.\n\nA: If you've removed the old partitioning – as you seem to have done – your old system is completely gone, including Gnome.\nDeleting the old partitions and creating new ones in their place made your PC forget about the data on the disk, allowing it to save your new Ubuntu in its place.\n", "Q: Turn on/off Bluetooth from shell not from applet Ubuntu 13.04 64 bits, on ELiteBook 8740, gnome desktop with bluetooth-applet shown.\nI could not figure out how to turn on and off from shell the Bluetooth and not from the notification bt applet menu.

The reason for this is due to the cron tasks and IO load\n  it puts on the servers which can impact other servers on the same\n  host. IO is the biggest cause for slow down on hosts which is why we\n  are fairly strict. We prefer to encourage people to use the find\n  command to find things eg find / -iname \"somename\"\n\nWhen trying to figure this out the first place I turned to was google, I was unable to find anything useful on this problem.\nI have added this as an answer so that hopefully people Googleing \"unable to install locate\" in the future can know to ask their hosting company first!\n", "Q: Ubuntu [GRUB]doesn't show up in advanced boot options Installed Ubuntu successfully on a PC running Windows 7 but had no option in the boot menu.\nThis is after a failed installation where GRUB failed to install.

The download did not finish and the install failed. My update history lists the installer as installed; it wasn't. From now on I will do proprietary software downloads and installs at home. My home computer had no problem with the Flashplugin installer download and install and it's a slower computer. My Internet service is a lot faster than the one at the Coffee Shop and it's steadier, too. Can I get a second shot at the Adobe Flashplugin installer download? \n\nA: You could try to uninstall it and reinstall, either in Software Center or by command line:\nsudo apt-get remove  flashplugin-installer\nsudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer\n\n\nA: Although the other poster is correct and you can remove and reinstall the package, you could instead download the gzip file from URLs a bit like e.g: http://archive.canonical.com/pool/partner/a/adobe-flashplugin/adobe-flashplugin_11.2.202.378.orig.tar.gz (the URL will change depending on your architecture and Flash version: check the directory index to be sure you've got the right one.)\nWith a gzipfile already available, you can simply reconfigure the package using:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure flashplugin-installer\n\nThis puts you into interactive mode, where you can specify the location of the downloaded gzipfile.\nReconfiguring is technically the right way to do it, especially if other packages depend on flashplugin-installer and so would be uninstalled to, or if you've already (while hacking around?) got a local download of the gzipfile: it's quicker to install that, rather than downloading it again.\n", "Q: Ubuntu lets me know an upgrade is available; never Installs It I use Lubuntu. For the past few weeks I've been getting a notification that a new version of the OS is available, but whenever I hit upgrade it does nothing.\nAt first I overlooked it since I thought maybe I'd noticed something new as I restarted my computer, but upon doing that -- and more -- the notification for me to upgrade keeps popping up, and I keep authenticating it without it ever going through.\nSince this is a problem with the software updater itself, the Ubuntu instructions didn't help, since it says to simply use software updater, bringing me back to the problem. \nSo what's the goof?\n\nA: upgrade via the terminal then since this sounds like a bug. It might be fixed already so I suggest you upgrade and report back if it's still an issue.\ncheck what updates that are available with (always do this first):\nsudo apt-get update\n\ninstall those upgrades with (this will install all upgrades available):\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nand install new kernels with: (Do not confuse this with do-release-upgrade since that upgrades the computer to a new release)\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nIf you wanna do it in one command here it is:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n", "Q: How do I get a program to start up at boot? I would like for Apache2 to start whenever the computer is booted. I'm using Ubuntu 13.10. To get Apache to start, I run this command in terminal:\nsudo /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start\n\nI will probably need step-by-step directions.\n\nA: From the location of the command (/usr/local/...) it seems that you have compiled apache yourself, and not installed the distribution's package. \nThe startup of the httpd daemons should be controlled by either upstart or the System-V style script in /etc/rc.d. \nThe simple solution is to add the command to /etc/rc.local. This file is a script that is executed at the end of the booting process. Open the file in your preferred editor, for example \ngksudo /etc/rc.local \n\nAnd add this before the line that read exit 0: \nif [ -x /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl ]; then \n   /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start\nfi\n\nThe test should avoid to have an error in the boot phase that will stop the boot process if somehow you manage to remove the program forgetting to re-edit the file. \n", "Q: Error mounting my additional partitions after editing fstab?

As this is my first time ever messing around with partitions and mounting, and I'm still very much a Linux newbie, it's very possible that I've overlooked something or made a simple mistake somewhere! \nDid I do something wrong? What's wrong here?\n\nA: Whoops!

I somehow forgot to specify \"ntfs-3g\" as the type! It should be:\n# NTFS shared partition 01 with windows [/dev/sdb7]..\nUUID=0269D46C148C27CE /mnt/shared_01 ntfs-3g auto,user,exec,nls=utf8,umask=003,gid=46,uid=1000 0 2\n\nThat fixed my issue, my partitions are now mounted properly, and everything is working as it should!\n", "Q: TMPFS for /var/cache When I use the TMPFS set for /var/cache and I reboot the computer and then once the computer has booted back into the Ubuntu 13.10 and login and goto run the Ubuntu Software Center it loads for about 2 seconds and then crashes out.\nMy System is a \n\n\n*\n\n*Intel I7\n\n*16GB Memory\n\n*1 x OCZ-SSD Drive 120GB BOOT Drive, With trim enabled in OS\n\n*1 X WD-HDD Drive 250GB User Drive\n\n\nHere is the TMPFS line that I add to the fstab file:\ntmpfs  /var/cache tmpfs   defaults,noatime,mode=0755   0  0 \nand also tried\ntmpfs  /var/cache tmpfs   defaults,noatime,mode=1777   0  0\nWhen I remove the above line(s) the Ubuntu Software-center works fine..\n\nA: Of course it wouldn't work fine.

I'm a Windows convert who has done only a little bit of dabbling in Ubuntu in the past (back in Dapper Drake a few years back). A lot has changes since then, and I've been yearning to jump back into linux again! So, having just bought a new SSD, I felt that this would be as good of a time as any to set up a dual-boot system again. I've messed around with Ubuntu 13.10 a bit, and while Unity has its issues, I think that it still needs some time to develop. I looked into XFCE and liked it a lot, so I went with Xubuntu.\nI've installed Xubuntu, and for the most part it's running smoothly and it a pleasure to work with. The customization is great and the minimalistic look and feel is really nice!\nBut here's my problem, whenever I select the \"Log Out\" option from either the application menu, or the user profiles menu, my PC comes to a crawl, and the dialog box with all the options (shut down, restart, log out, etc.) takes maybe a minute or more to appear. I click the log out button, my PC is brought to a snail's pace, and I have to wait for what seems like an eternity for the logout options to appear! If i try to open something else (even a terminal window) while it's loading the logout options, that other program won't finish loading until the logout screen finally appears.\nKeep in mind, this is a pretty much vanilla install of Xubuntu 13.10 64bit, on a PC with an intel i7, an SSD, 6gb DDR3 RAM, and a new AMD 7770 gpu (drivers haven't been installed yet, though). Everything else runs fast, most applications open near-instantly! It must be an issue with how the logout options screen initializes or something, but I'm not sure exactly how I can fix it..\nEdit - Extra Info: This problem is very consistent when using the \"Log Out\" buttons in Xubuntu. However, I've found that I'm able to reboot and shutdown much more quickly by going through the \"Switch User\" screen, and using the reboot or shutdown buttons on that screen. I'm nearly certain that it has something to do with the little Log Out options screen that appears when I select Log Out from the menu, and not the actual process of shutting down..\nSo what should I do? I really like XFCE so far, and I've never tried a non-ubuntu based distro before, but should I just switch to something else? Is there any known fix for this issue? Are there any work-arounds for logging out/shutting down/rebooting via the terminal so that I can avoid this irritating bug? Is there any that I can monitor the progress of the log out via terminal, allowing me to see which parts are causing the slow-down? What is the best way to report this bug to someone?\n\nA: You are not alone... This is a confirmed bug and I must add a VERY annoying bug. \nIn theory it has been fixed by late 2013 but at least in my case, even after update/upgrade my box was still displaying the same behaviour. \nIn my case the only way of fixing it was to follow the work-around documented under the same bug:\nComment xubuntu in /etc/upstart-xsessions and voilà!\n\nA: Try ctl+alt+F2 and switch back with ctrl+alt+F7, the menu magicaly apears.\nAt least this is how i do it. It has to be a bug of somekind.\nIf I dont do this combination, i cant interact with any open window, no alt tabin, nothing works. It seems as it froze but it actualy didnt.\nI hope it helps, but its a lame circumvention i know.\n", "Q: After Installation Issues I have been playing with Ubuntu since 8.04 and have several servers running 64bit 12.04LTS full time.  I have used desktop on and off over this time period but have never committed any machine to running desktop full time.  I have a HP dv9000 with AMD Athlon x2 and NVidia which I have used with Vista, Ubuntu Studio, 7, and now trying to get 13.10 to run on it without success.  After trying both the 64bit and 32bit versions I decided to try 32bit Ubuntu Gnome.  It is running ok, but is still somewhat glitchy. \nAfter my first attempt, I did some digging and found out that there are some driver-related issues and would need to install the NVidia drivers.  During the next attempt to run Ubuntu Unity I would alt+shift+f1 to get to a terminal and install the drivers.  Reboot, and try to go in to Unity.  It would \"work\" for a short amount of time, usually less than 5 minutes, then everything would freeze on the desktop but the mouse.  I couldn't get anything to happen or access a terminal.  The only way to get out of the situation was to force-restart the system.  \nI have been playing with Gnome version for the last 2 days and, while it sometimes freezes, it seems to run far more reliably.  I can open multiple programs and switch between them, use email, the Internet, all things I was unable to do under Unity.  \nSo, I decided to install Unity on the working Gnome install and, no surprise, it started having the exact same problems when I logged in to it.  However, the Gnome environment was the same as before.\nThis machine was running Win 7 fine before I decided to make it my first full-time Ubuntu  Desktop machine, so I am leaning towards a hardware compatibility issue between Ubuntu 13.10 and the dv9000.\n\nA: Try the below commands on virtual console(ctrl+Alt+F1),\nsudo rm /etc/X11/xorg.conf\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall unity\nsudo shutdown -r now\n\nYou might get back to your original desktop\n", "Q: Grub does not load up even after running boot-repair I had a successfully running computer with dual booting Windows 8 and Ubuntu 13.04 until I made the drastic decision to upgrade Windows 8 to 8.1.\nThe upgrade to Windows 8.1 was fine but I discovered that Grub was not loading.\nSo using a live CD I managed to run boot-repair to repair the EFI partition (just like when I first installed Ubuntu about few months ago).\nHowever this time even after running boot-repair with recommended settings, Windows 8.1 keeps booting rather than Grub.\nCheers \n\nA: Turn off secure boot and run boot-repair.\n", "Q: run a script as non-root user I want to run a script say some_script.sh(that requires root permissions, contains some sudo do something in a for loop) as non-root user.

It has no internet connection, a CD drive (will not read DVD's), and will not boot from USB. Is there a way I can get the full install file onto my USB drive and transfer it to the laptop and do the install from the desktop?\n\nA: If it can read a regular cd you could burn super grub2 disk to a cd and boot from the cd. When you boot from the cd it will bring you to a menu. If you arrow down and hit enter on enable extra grub boot functionality it will take you to another menu that shows: enable usb boot experimental. If you select that it may take a second but it will send you back to the main menu. Then you can hit detect any operating systems it may take a minute considering the laptop but your bootable usb drive should be detected that way and you can force it to boot that way so you can install a distro of linux on your harddrive :3 I've had to force many computers to boot like that even got a 1998 compaq and a 97 Acer to do that.

It is a full featured keyboard macro processor and it's easy to define simple macros for such a task.\nAutoKey does a whole lot of other things easily and, if you know Python which is used as its macro language, you can get a keypress or phrase to do almost anything your system is capable of.  And, it works with just about any program because, by default, its output appears to be coming directly from the keyboard exactly the same as if you were typing it.\nTry it and see if it works for you. We don't currently have any developers on the project, but the support list is active and many people are successfully using it.\nI just reread your question more carefully and the bit about the other modifier keys still working makes it more complicated because you would probably have to code a separate macro for each modifier combination with each key (i, j, k, l), but I think it would still work.\nIf you decide to try it, make sure you have the latest version (0.90.4) as many distros provide older versions that don't work as well.\n", "Q: Converting images into video I found a method on internet to use avconv to make a video from images, but the quality is very poor.

But putting the root partition on the LVM after the fact is quite difficult and probably would be better done with a reinstallation. Furthermore, it is not possible to just create a LVM on a already mounted partition.\nBut it seems that the main goal is to provide some space on a LVM for Xen domains. This can be done by shrinking /dev/sda1 and creating a new partition /dev/sda2 for a LVM physical volume. \n\nWarning: The procedure described below will change your partitions and filesystems. If there is any data on this system you cannot do without, a backup is strongly recommended.\n\nWhile it is possible to resize a mounted filesystem and partition, it is not recommended and should only be done if you really know what you are doing. I'd recommend using the GParted Live System. It provides graphical tool, to easily resize partitions and create new ones.\nCreate a GParted Live CD or USB drive and boot from it. Once it is running, there is a desktop with some icons. Open the one saying GParted.\nIn the GParted program select your hard drive (it should say \"/dev/sda (60 GiB)\"). Right-click on the partition (\"/dev/sda1\") and select \"Resize/Move\". You now can set the size in \"New Size (MiB)\". Depending on what you want to do with the system itself, I'd recomend to leave at least 12 GiB for your system (you already use 4.2 GiB and you may want to be able to download ISOs for installation of your Xen guests). Ensure that it still says \"0\" in \"Free space preceeding (MiB)\", as you want to create the new partition after your root partition. Save the changes.\nNow right-click on \"unallocated\" and select \"New\". Change \"File system\" to \"lvm2 pv\". The rest should already be set to fill the entire free space. Add the partition.\nFinalize these changes by clicking on \"Apply all Operations\" (either the check mark in the toolbar or in the \"Edit\" menu)\nRestart your machine to your own system.\nNow you can create a volume group on /dev/sda2\n# vgcreate vm /dev/sda2\n\nThen locical volumes can be created in this volume group with\n# lvcreate -L 10G -n lv0 vm\n\nThe new logical volume will have a size of 10 GB and be named \"lv0\".

Using that option will automatically format your hard drive, thus removing the old installation of Ubuntu.\nWarning: Make sure to backup any files you want to keep, since your home directory will be gone afterwards, too.\n", "Q: PATH variable to Apache OPENNLP OK but doesn't work yesterday I installed in my Ubuntu AWS 12.04 (Amazon) micro istance OpenNLP and seemed working.\nToday when digiting opennlp:command not found\nFollowing suggestions found here:\nI modified my .bash_profile:\nexport JAVA_CMD=$JAVA_HOME/bin/java\nexport PATH=$PATH:/OPENNLP_HOME/bin\nexport PATH=$PATH\nexport PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH\nexport PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH\nexport PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH\nexport PATH=/usr/local/sbin:$PATH\nexport PATH=/usr/local/heroku/bin:$PATH\n\necho $PATH\n/usr/local/heroku/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/home/ubuntu/bin:/home/ubuntu/.nvm/v0.10.12/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_40/bin:/OPENNLP_HOME/bin\n\necho $JAVA_HOME\n/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_40\n\necho $JAVA_CMD\n/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_40/bin/java\n\nWhat do I have to do next in order to make it work again?\n\nA: Is /OPENNLP_HOME/bin the actual path of of opn_nlp?\nWhat is the output of the below command?\necho $OPENNLP_HOME \n\nYou first need to do:\nexport OPENNLP_HOME=\"Path TO OpenNLP Folder\"\nexport PATH=$PATH:$OPENNLP_HOME/bin\n\n", "Q: How to clean /tmp? rizhas@rizhas-laptop:~$ df -h\nFilesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on\n/dev/sda7        67G   58G  5,2G  92% /\nnone            4,0K     0  4,0K   0% /sys/fs/cgroup\nudev            1,5G   12K  1,5G   1% /dev\ntmpfs           303M  1,2M  302M   1% /run\nnone            5,0M     0  5,0M   0% /run/lock\nnone            1,5G  348K  1,5G   1% /run/shm\nnone            100M   80K  100M   1% /run/user\noverflow        1,0M  1,0M     0 100% /tmp\noverflow        1,0M  1,0M     0 100% /tmp\n\nHow to clean up /tmp?\n\nA: The directory /tmp means temporary.\nThis directory stores temporary data. You don't need to delete anything from it, the data contained in it gets deleted automatically after every reboot.\nStill if you want to delete the data present in it use\nsudo rm -r /tmp/*\ndeleting from it won't cause any problem as these are temporary files.\n\nA: You can assume that anything inside a tmp directory (/tmp/ /usr/tmp etc) can be deleted. BEFORE you start deleting stop all programs and services you are using since /tmp/ can be used by programs to temporarily store information for that session. So do a sudo service mysql stop and sudo service apache2 stop if you have a mysql and/or apache running. The name of the files in the /tmp/ directory most times give a clue to what program they belong.\nSo from command line...\ncd /tmp/\npwd\nsudo rm -r *\n\nwill empty the /tmp/ directory and remove all files and subdirectories. Be careful to type it correctly. The command pwd in there is not necessary but should show /tmp.\nIf you want it interactively (so you need to confirm deleting):\ncd /tmp/\nsudo rm -ri *\n\nAlso worth noting that a reboot will clear /tmp aswell as shown here: How is the /tmp directory cleaned up? So if /tmp/ is full of files after a reboot you need to investigate where those files originate from. \nI also would like to state that 1 Mb for /tmp is not a lot of space. Are you using MySQL? See https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/76058/10017 on how to fix this (thanks @drc)\n\nA: Be careful before running a command like rm -r ./*. Once you run it, it will be very difficult or impossible to recover any data.\nAll will be removed. Make sure that the directory you are deleting in is right.\nThere is a safer way to handle things.\n# sudo rm -r /tmp/*\n\nThat way, when you accidentally run this command from inside your shell history, it won't delete the wrong files (unless you're keeping them in /tmp).\n\nA: The /tmp directory was cleared by default at every boot, because TMPTIME is 0 by default.\n\nA: /tmp is supposed to be cleaned up on reboot, but if you don't reboot (which is normal for servers), clean up will not happen\nfind /tmp -ctime +10 -exec rm -rf {} +\nwill delete all files and folders older than 10 days.\nyou may want to add it to the daily cron.\n\nUPDATE\nIn comments below @sfussenegger recommends a slightly different format of this command that may be better suited to your needs and to the system you're operating on.\nsudo find /tmp -type f -atime +10 -delete\nHere the command is using sudo to make sure everything is deleted (or you could run it as root), operating on files that haven't been accessed for more than 10 days and only deletes files, not folders. It also uses -delete to avoid having to execute rm command\n\nA: The tmpreaper program can be used to clean up /tmp periodically. This program deletes everything that has not been accessed in a given timeframe, typically two weeks. For this to work properly, the filesystem it is on should have the atimes option enabled. If you use a tmpfs, which it appears you are doing, then you should be fine.\nOf course, rebooting also clears /tmp, but that would be boring.\n\nA: If your “/tmp” mount on a linux filesystem is mounted as overflow (often sized at 1MB), this is likely due to you not specifying “/tmp” as its own partition and your root filesystem filled up and “/tmp” was remounted as a fallback. To fix this after you’ve cleared space, just unmount the fallback and it should remount at its original point:\nsudo umount overflow\n\nif device is busy use\nsudo umount -l overflow\n\n\nA: Here's what worked for me:\nsudo reboot\nAfter a runaway process filled up my drive through the /tmp directory, I too considered rm -rf /tmp/* but instead just rebooted and df of my root directory went from 99% full to 77% full.\nYe ol' adage strikes again: \"Did you turn it off and then on again?\"\n\nA: use built-in tmpfiles.d instead of.\nCheck this answer:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/857154/453746\n\nI think the right answer is that Ubuntu 16.10 has a new setup. There\nis a folder /etc/tmpfiles.d, documented in the man page \"tmpfiles.d\".\nIn that folder, one should place a configuration file to control\nwhether the /tmp is to be erased. This is what I am doing to stop\nreboots from erasing files in /tmp unless they are 20 days old:\n#/etc/tmpfiles.d/tmp.conf\nd /tmp 1777 root root 20d Replace \"20d\" by \"-\" if you never want files\ndeleted.

The only way to go back to RO mode is to reflash your device with ubuntu-device-flash.\nOTA updates are still delivered to your device, but each one is at your own risk –you may have made changes that mean the OTA has bad side effects.

It's now easy with stock Smplayer to display two subtitles. Just select your 2nd subtitle as a Secondary track and the player should automatically position it on the top.\nAccording to the blog:\n\nThis is available since SVN r6474 and requires mpv.\n\nTo install mpv: sudo apt-get install mpv\nIf it still doesn't work, try resetting the configuration file. According to Smplayer FAQ: \n\nThe easiest way to find the configuration files of SMPlayer is by selecting the option \"Open configuration folder\" in the Help menu. If you want to delete the current configuration and start with the default settings, just delete the file smplayer.ini (important: be sure SMPlayer is not running when you delete the file).\n\n\nA: You can also use DualSub to merge subtitles.

On disabling explorer.exe file in windows, we disable the click events as well as the desktop icons and all other interface facilities are disabled.\nIs there any file in ubuntu which disables these interface facilities in ubuntu?\n\nA: Explorer's equivalent is Nautilus in standard Ubuntu. It manages the file browsing and desktop. Unity is rendered out by Compiz, which is separate though.\nYour simplest route for disabling all of that, is to just use a different session and Window Manager. Something like OpenBox or even NoDM (if you're just running one application). It'll mean you need to get under the hood and work out how window managers work...

Maybe it could do this in a git sort of way, similar to Mac OSX' time machine, so only changes to the system are saved and uploaded, and my bandwidth isn't used up uploading every last bit of information to another location, over and over again.\nI'd also want to use this disc image if were to move hosts. I'd like to be able to back up my local ubuntu installation with it too.\nOr does Ubuntu include some command line tools that make this backup process less daunting? Will I be able to write a script myself that calls some commands to backup my vps?\nI know of Ubuntu One and the Ubuntu's backup application on my local machine, so is there a CLI equivalent for my server?\nI'm prepared to change my ubuntu installation to > 13 if it means these tools will be available.\nNow, when Windows goes funny, your best bet is to nuke it and reinstall everything. But Ubuntu is far superior :D , so could I use this backup process without fear of bugs and corruption and other nasties?\n\nA: From experience, I can recommend creating a disaster plan that you (or somebody else, in the case of your death - yeah, it's serious stuff) can completely rebuild the asset from backups if the main server (and you) were hit by a meteor.\nIn most cases you're actually not going to want image backups. They're hard to use in a VPS environment because you lack access... And anything your VPS provides might die when they're hit by the meteor.\nMy disaster plan with one of my clients involves the following items:\n\n\n*\n\n*Get backup from S3.\n\n*Install Ubuntu (latest LTS) with a VPS and then log in as root.\n\n*Copy backup to SSH location (with basic instructions)\n\n*Run a script that was included in your backup. This unpacks, sets permissions, creates the right users, applies security, etc.\n\n*Fix your DNS (include details) to point to new IP.\n\n\nIt's a lot of work. And it's important that you test it too. Follow all of it (except the DNS) to the letter and if you're left with anything but a functioning server at the end of it, you need to go back and improve things.\nAnd you need to keep testing it. At least every LTS release you need to go back and check that it all still works. That your backups are being created in the right way.\nYou can assume a certain level of competency in the person following the instructions (you can assume your company hires somebody with some training and you can explain in the document what people will need to know how to do in order to execute your commands) but it's very important that you mention everything that isn't completely standard.\n\nIn a non-disaster scenario, it's also good to have these sorts of scripts (and documentation) around if you want to move something on a server to another server. It let you know what's what very quickly without having to spend hours working out why you've got three separate copies of nginx running on a single server.\n", "Q: Duplicate source error on apt-get update When I run apt-get update on my Ubuntu 13.10 Desktop install I get this error:\nW: Duplicate sources.list entry http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable/main       amd64 Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/dl.google.com_linux_chrome_deb_dists_stable_main_binary-amd64_Packages)\nW: Duplicate sources.list entry http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable/main i386 Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/dl.google.com_linux_chrome_deb_dists_stable_main_binary-i386_Packages)\nW: You may want to run apt-get update to correct these problems\n\nWhat does this mean? how can I resolve it? and what issues can it create?

What is the best way to replace 12.04's pre-loaded samba with centrify-enabled samba? I tried just uninstalling it, but it looks like nautilus is dependent on it. Any ideas? Do I need to uninstall nautilus too?\n\nA: There are two basic ways to do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make a package for samba with the changes you want, and install it as an upgrade. I think this is the better choice, but It is complicated the first time you do it, and you have to make sure that you create a new package each time there are changes to the package in the repository.\n\n*Make a package called samba that is empty, using equivs or similar. (for detailed instructions see http://shallowsky.com/blog/linux/install/blocking-deb-dependencies.html ) and install samba by hand into /usr/local. The drawback of this approach is that samba is no longer managed by your package management system, you have to keep up with all security updates by hand, and If at some point a version of samba with a higher version then your dummy package comes along, you have to make sure it does not get installed.\n", "Q: Is it a problem in Wine: small and upper caps?

Anyway if you aren't using that option when you have two files (or directories) that have names that only differ by case, wine will just pick one and from my experience four out of five times the one I didn't want.

Select 'try linux without installing' option.\nAfter the Ubuntu starts, it should be visible from the File Manager - no guarantees, of course, but Nautilus should be able to read the file system present and mount it automatically.\n", "Q: Texlive-common and lang-norwegian not cooperating I got sublime and texlive working, but I'm norwegian and want to write in norwegian so I'm trying to install that language.

The # open will increase by 1. Once dd terminates, # open decreases by 1. If # open is 0, nothing is using it and the LV can be safely deactivated.\nSegments refers to fragmentation of LV. If you grow the LV, but there is no consecutive space available, it will create a new segment in a free part of your physical volume(s). The number of segments is the number of fragments so to speak.\nFor example my HDD/TV LV has 4 segments and it looks like this:\n lvs -o lv_name,size,seg_size,devices HDD/TV\n  LV   LSize SSize   Devices      \n  TV   2.10t 698.56g /dev/dm-8(0) \n  TV   2.10t 698.56g /dev/dm-3(0) \n  TV   2.10t 698.56g /dev/dm-2(0) \n  TV   2.10t  52.31g /dev/dm-1(32)\n\nSo the total size of 2.1t is achieved by 3 segments with 698.56g each, plus one segment of 52.31g.\n", "Q: Why only sudo'ers can execute the file? How is it possible that to be able to execute a binary file with 755 permission, one has to be in sudo'ers list ?\nI am trying to let a program run by a non-sudo user. \nIt does not happen, but if I execute via sudo or as root, it works as it should.\nFile permission is 755 root root.\nThe whole program directory is in /opt.\nSome details: \nUbuntu 12.04 Server, 64bit\nthe software is basically an old 32bit version of Firefox 1.9.something, modified to some extent to\nconnect to a Tomcat server.\nupdate\na user not listed in sudo'ers list can start the program.\nonly my sudo user cannot, i.e. by running simply ./program,\nsudo ./programm runs just fine.\n\nA: The most probable reason is that the program, once running as a normal user, is trying to read some file or doing some operation which is reserved to privileged users (basically root).\nFor example, if your program is trying to using (binding) to one of the lower internet ports (less than 1024) it needs root privileges to do that (1). Or it try to read a file or use a library which is marked for root only.\nThe hammer(2) solution is to mark the program set-uid root (SUID-root). This is quite dangerous, it should be avoided by coding the program so it does not need it, and it is practically impossible to distribute --- I would never accept set-uid programs form unofficial sources in my computer, and even then I don't like them either. I am posting the answer because I think it's good to know that they exists.\nSo making sure that all the services/files that the program uses are accessible to it is the correct solution, otherwise probably the program must be run as root with all the consequences.\nBig fat warning: this is dangerous, and SUID-root programs can do whatever they want to the system. If they have bugs, the user can easily take control of the whole system or destroy it.\nIf you make a program set-uid root, anyone can run it, and it will run as root. This will work only for binary executable; set-uid bit do not work for scripts (shell, python or whatever).\nIf you really want to run a script as root, you need a wrapper, as the one in this answer on stackoverflow. But before doing that, read all the question an be sure to understand the (not so) fine points about security. If you really want that script running as root for every user, I would opt for editing sudoers so that they can run it with sudo without having any password asked. This answer on stackoverflow lists a lot of ideas.\nExample of set-uid usage: I make a copy of cat (output the content of a file to terminal), change it to be owned by root, and try to read a file owned by root and that only root can read:\n(0)asus-romano:~/tmp/suidtest% cp /bin/cat .              \n(0)asus-romano:~/tmp/suidtest% ls -l ./cat\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 romano romano 46884 Nov 21 09:49 ./cat\n(0)asus-romano:~/tmp/suidtest% sudo chown root.root ./cat\n(0)asus-romano:~/tmp/suidtest% ls -l\ntotal 48\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 46884 Nov 21 09:49 cat\n(1)asus-romano:~/tmp/suidtest% ./cat /etc/shadow- > /dev/null\n./cat: /etc/shadow-: Permission denied\n\nNow, I change the program to be suid-root (notice the s in the permission flags):\n(0)asus-romano:~/tmp/suidtest% sudo chmod u+s ./cat\n(0)asus-romano:~/tmp/suidtest% ls -l ./cat\n-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 46884 Nov 21 09:49 ./cat\n(0)asus-romano:~/tmp/suidtest% ./cat /etc/shadow- > /dev/null\n\nNo error...\nAgain, do not do it unless you trust completely the program and the users.\n(1) well, there are fine-grained privileges in Linux called capabilities, but are seldom used and quite complex...\n(2) when you have a hammer, all things starts looking like nails...\n\nA: I would try moving the file to a group other than root...\nIf you read this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions\nand you -ll and see XXXX  root root\nMeans that your file/program belongs to \"root\" and is 755-able to members of the \"root\" group.  Therefore, either \n1) add your other non-root users to the root group, or \n2) create a brand-new group and assign that group to the files/programs you are running.\nHere for creating groups and stuff: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Users_and_Groups\nI hope that helps!\n", "Q: Set Window Icon to Gtk Stock Icon in PyGtk I am trying to add a Gtk stock icon to my window.

I'm sure this has to do something with Gtk or PyGtk versions, but I can't figure what I am doing wrong. Thanks in advance and sorry for the novice question.\n\nA: The problem is that you are looking at the PyGTK documentation, but are using PyGI/GTK3 in your script.\nThe docs on gtk_widget_render_icon() says the following:\n\ngtk_widget_render_icon has been deprecated since version 3.0 and should not be used in newly-written code.

Use gtk_icon_theme_load_icon() instead.\n\nGreat huh?! So let's move on.\ngtk_icon_theme_load_icon() takes the following arguments:\n\n\n*\n\n*icon_name :  the name of the icon to lookup \n\n*size :   the desired icon size. The resulting icon may not be exactly this size\n\n*flags :  flags modifying the behavior of the icon lookup\n\n\nKnowing this, you can change your old render_icon line with the following:\n        icontheme = Gtk.IconTheme.get_default()\n        self.icon = icontheme.load_icon(Gtk.STOCK_FLOPPY, 128, 0)\n\nWhich will lookup a 128x128 px image. You might want to change the flags if needed, the enum is documented here. This can be translated into Python like this:\nGTK_ICON_LOOKUP_NO_SVG -> Gtk.IconLookupFlags.NO_SVG\nGTK_ICON_LOOKUP_FORCE_SVG -> Gtk.IconLookupFlags.FORCE_SVG\nGTK_ICON_LOOKUP_USE_BUILTIN -> Gtk.IconLookupFlags.USE_BUILTIN\n# And so on...\n\n", "Q: Wifi issue on nexus 4 16GB i had installed ubuntu on nexus 4 8GB and it ran ok, then i decided try into my nexus 4 16GB.

I've done a complete install on one of the machines, and cloned the disk using dd. The issue is that if I use dd to write this image to the disk of another machine, it will no longer boot. That is, the machine reports \"no bootable devices found\" on all machines except the one where I created the iamge.\nI suspect that this may be due to something device- or machine-specific about the way the UEFI boot is set up, but I can't say for sure. I don't do anything out of the ordinary as far as I'm aware.\nFor what it's worth, running Boot-Repair on one of the clones does fix the problem and let the machine boot, but I'd rather not have to run that manually on every new machine I want to clone the image to. Also, this seems to tie the drive to that machine, so inserting a \"fixed\" drive into a machine other than the one Boot-Repair was run on will yield the \"no bootable devices found\" message again.\nClearly it must be possible to construct an image in such a way that the UEFI boot entries will work on any machines, as this is what the Ubuntu install image does, but I have no idea how it achieves that?\nIf it's of any help, here is the boot info file generated by Boot-Repair when it fixed the disk on a new machine.\n\nA: Curiously, the problem resolved itself when I opened the UEFI boot manager (F2 during boot) and reset to factory defaults.\nMy guess is that I had at some point enabled \"Quick boot\" or some such feature which disabled the search for \"unregistered\" UEFI boot partitions. Running grub-update (which invokes efibootmgr) essentially registers GRUB with the UEFI boot manager so it doesn't have to search for it, but since this command has not yet been run on the cloned machines, efibootmgr hasn't been run, and therefore the GRUB installation won't be in the boot manager's list.\n\nA: Jon Gjensget's answer helpfully says:\n\nRunning grub-update (which invokes efibootmgr) essentially registers GRUB with the UEFI boot manager\n\nBut then omits how to actually run efibootmgr. I don't want to have to unlock the encrypted disk, mount all the right things like /dev, /boot, /boot/efi. etc., chroot, and finally be able to run grub-update, if I can just run efibootmgr, especially since the disk is now in a known-good state (restored from backup) and I don't want to wait another two hours to re-image it if I mess the boot up.\nRunning cd /boot/efi/EFI; cp -r ubuntu BOOT as suggested in comments did not work for me, even though I am also running into the issue on an Intel NUC.\nBoot-repair also didn't work for me: the repair button as shown in screenshots is not there, and in advanced options there isn't any option to just run efibootmgr, it looks like it's just a GUI button to run grub-update (and a lot of other tools like fsck) instead of actually fixing the boot by itself.\nThis is the command that worked for me (run from a live boot stick):\nefibootmgr -c -g -d /dev/sda -p 1 -w -L \"myboot\" -l '\\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi'\nefibootmgr # to verify it's in the boot options list\nefibootmgr -n [ID HERE] # to make sure it boots that option next time\n\nThe -n [ID] did not turn out to be necessary, it booted that option every time after creating it (there were no other boot options that work anyway, which is why I'm confused why it doesn't just try to boot from the only possible boot option in the first place....).\nThe options used are:\n\n\n*\n\n*-c create new boot option\n\n*-g force it to treat the disk as GPT (not sure if this is necessary, I didn't try it without this option)\n\n*-d which device to use, in my case /dev/sda\n\n*-p the partition number which contains your EFI boot folder and .efi boot file, in my case the device was /dev/sda1 (a FAT32 partition) so the partition number is 1\n\n*-w \"write unique signature to the MBR if needed\" (don't know if this is needed)\n\n*-L a name of your choosing, I chose a name that is unique to me so I can recognize it later\n\n*-l path to your .efi file you want to use for booting, I assume for grub on x86_64 this is always \\EFI\\...\\grubx64.efi and the ... depends on your distribution. You can find the right path on the partition (previously specified by -d and -p), and it's typically mounted in /boot/efi so you can look in /boot/efi/EFI what the directory name is where grubx64.efi is located.\n\n\nSource: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=160757 -- this is simply the first command in the thread. The replies give more suggestions, but the first command worked for me.\n\nA: Under EFI, boot loaders are stored as files in the EFI System Partition (ESP). Ordinarily, such files have names that are unique to the OS, such as EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi for Ubuntu. Because of this fact, boot loaders must be registered in the firmware's NVRAM. The Ubuntu installer does this when the OS is installed, but when you move the disk to another computer, its NVRAM has not been modified, so the computer won't boot. Using Boot Repair will install a fresh copy of GRUB and register it with the firmware, thus fixing the problem. My guess is that your firmware's own boot manager does a scan and registers the boot loader, too, but it could be that something else is going on.\nOne possible workaround to this problem is to copy GRUB from EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi to EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi. The latter is a fallback name -- the computer boots from that name if it can't find any registered boot loader. Removable media also use that same filename, since obviously, an OS installation disk can't be pre-registered unless it uses some agreed-upon common name. It's possible that Ubuntu and/or Boot Repair copied GRUB to this name, too, that your firmware didn't initially detect it for some reason, and that using the firmware's boot manager caused it to notice this file's presence, thus explaining the bootability after you used that tool. In fact, this seems more likely than that your firmware scanned for Ubuntu's default boot loader filename.\n", "Q: What versions of Ubuntu Server include opensm?

I wanted to ask for any idea so to solve my problem. I am using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and my purpose is to use OpenFoam CFD software.\nI am trying to execute an script called Allrun that corresponds to a tutorial. I am using the sudo command like this.\nsudo ./Allrun\n\nthen it asks for my password and after introducing it, it suddenly appears a message saying:\n./Allrun: 5: .: Can't open /bin/tools/RunFunctions\n\nThis path appeares at line 5 as sourced in the script, so like:\n. $WM_PROJECT_DIR/bin/tools/RunFunctions\n\nbeing $WM_PROJECT_DIR a variable defined in opt/openfoam22/etc/bashrc and pointing the directory: \n$WM_PROJECT_DIR= /opt/openfoam222\n\n(this bashrc is at the same time sourced in ~/.bashrc file, and I can use the variable in the terminal, so I assume it is allright sourced)\nI have tried also to chmod the RunFunctions file with rwx permissions, and veryfied with\n\"ls -la\" that its permissions changed (they did), but didn't solve anything.\nI am new in linux, and any help will be great, thanks in advance.\n\nA: It seems that at the point of execution, the variable is not defined; the script search for a file /bin/tools/RunFunctions/, not /opt/openfoam222/bin/tools/RunFunctions. \nNotice that non-interactive shells does not load .bashrc by default, so the fact that the variable is defined when you use it in interactive is not a proof. Even if you are running the script from you shell, the variables are not exported to sub-shell by default, they need to be declared export to do that.\nTry to add a line like \necho \"DEBUG variable is $WM_PROJECT_DIR\"\n\nbefore the failing line in ./Allrun and check the output. If this is the problem, you should explicitly source the file in your script. Or add an \nexport WM_PROJECT_DIR \n\nto pass it to subshells. \nAdded (after comments). Notice that you shouldn't explicitly source your .bashrc in your .profile (they have different meaning and the shell sources them in different occasions, see for example here.)\nScripts (non-interactive) should never rely on your login shell to run. If they need specific files/definitions, the should source them explicitly.

So definitely a good idea to partition the drive out properly.\nSplit your linux partition into three with root or '/' with about 20 to 50 gb, a swap space with about 5 to 10 and the rest as /home, for your own programmes and data. This will make Ubuntu more stable all round.\n13.10 is a development release - it's about doing development for the next stable release, which will be 14.04, so it isn't a good idea to depend on 13.10 long-term.\nYour best bet is to install 13.10 and upgrade to 14.04 next April.

This program is supposed to make snow (the type of precipitation) appear on the desktop. However, running the program does nothing except return the following code:\nXsnow-1.42resizeable, December 14th 2001 by Rick Jansen (rja@euronet.nl)\nWWW: http://www.euronet.nl/~rja/Xsnow/\n\nThis is because the program is designed to draw the snow on the root X window, as stated on the website:\n\nFrequently asked question: I start Xsnow but I don't see any snow? \n  Answer: Xsnow makes it snow on the X-window \"root\" window. That root\n  window is often obscured by desktop managers, to display icons and\n  tools. So, Xsnow works fine, you just cannot see the snow! See the\n  README for details and possible solutions.\n\nI tried it in an Ubuntu 13.10 VM, Kubuntu 13.10 and 14.04, and a Lubuntu Trusty Live USB. It is working in Xubuntu, because in Xfce we see the root X window by default. In chat, someone reported it working in Ubuntu 12.04, but in my Ubuntu 13.10 VM I don't see snow.\nThe problem is that, as I mentioned, xsnow draws solely on the root X Window. The root X window is the \"parent\" of all the other X windows and is therefore also invisible, because modern desktop environments such as KDE and Unity usually hide the root X window with a desktop effects compositor. So xsnow still draws snow, (you can get snatches of it when logging in and out due to graphics fragmentation) it's just not visible. On simpler desktops like Openbox and XFCE, the X window (and thus the snow) are completely visible.\nIs there any way to view the root X window activity and thus see the snow?\n\nA: Using KDE you can use kwin-snow-effect package.\nHow to install:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ivan-safonov/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install kwin-effect-snow\n\nThen in KDE you can set up the effect from System Settings --> Desktop Effects --> All Effects and activate snow.\nYou can also use the Compiz plugin Snow, Check how it works on this Youtube video\nI found xwinwrap, that let you stick any app as your desktop background. Click here to download it, Or here to read to coder's release note\nIt does not give you access to the root window (which seems difficult on most desktop environments). And this one doesn't work with xsnow but it will work with a lot of other apps...\n\nA: Just did some more testing on 12.04 ( Likely this is not the answer for 13.10, but for those who want this on 12.04)\nIf in gnome-tweak-tool, under Desktop I check Have file manager handle the desktop. Then both in Unity and in Unity-2D xsnow works. Altough in unity-2d the snow in the air is invisible, only the fallen are visible, but that's because of my graphic card and its driver. In Unity it works perfectly.\nIf in gnome-tweak-tool I uncheck Have file manager handle the desktop, then xsnow won't even start and throws an error both in Unity and Unity-2D \n\nA: I'm a user of Precise with Unity environment, and had the same problem until executing this command:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons true\n\n\n\nHere's an extract of the xsnow man page's notes:\n\nSGI Irix 5.x\nSilicon  Graphics and Irix 5.x users may not see any snow or Santa at all, as long the desktop icons are visible. To circumvent this problem issue this command:\n/usr/lib/desktop/telldesktop quit\n\nThe icons will disappear and Xsnow will work perfectly. To restart the desktop just  start\n/usr/lib/desktop/startdesktop\n\nor  select  Desk‐top -> Home Directory from the toolchest.\nIt's  even  possible to have both - desktop icons and xsnow (and even multiple desks). You need to modify the window manager's resource file 4DWm, the file ~/.desktop-hostname/4DWm. Example:\n\n\n*\n\n*Global.backgroundDescription:   -execute /etc/killall -TERM xsnow ; /usr/local/bin/xsnow\n\n*Desk 1.backgroundDescription:   -execute /etc/killall -TERM xsnow ; /usr/local/bin/xsnow\n\n*Desk 2.backgroundDescription:   -execute /etc/killall -TERM xsnow ; /usr/local/bin/xsnow\nRestart the window manager (4Dwm) from the toolchest and Xsnow should appear. What this does is stop the currently running Xsnow and start a new one when you switch to another desktop.\n\nA: For gnome you can just tell it not to handle the desktop  \ngconftool-2 --set \"/apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop\" --type bool false\n\n\nI had also come across some mention of using shantz-xwinwrap for For Unity Compiz, however, it doesn't seem possible on to use with 13.10's version of unity without more fine-tuned control of xsnow.\nThat said if you want to give it a try in a terminal execute:\nwget http://anibg.googlecode.com/files/shantz-xwinwrap_v0.3.deb && sudo dpkg -i shantz-xwinwrap_v0.3.deb\n\nOnce installed, possible execution of xwinwrap without anibg might look like:\nnice -n 15 xwinwrap -ni -o 0.90 -fs -s -sp -st -b -nf -- '/usr/games/xsnow'\n\n\nA: On a standard 12.04.3 64 bit install, login, have just a terminal window near the bottom of the screen, and start xsnow, which works.  Seems to be a leftover  knowledge of where windows were when xsnow was started, and the snow cutoff still occurs after the window is moved or iconized.  Problems occur when a window is near the top of the screen.  Logout/in clears up old windows positions, so experiment with a fresh login (or maybe X restart).  The default delay of 20 is pretty near the minimum for me, increasing that may make the snow appear too.\n\nxsnow options are described in the man pages or with the -h switch.  -delay 30 will make a 30 millisecond delay between updates, instead of the default which is 20.  I find things get flakey at 18, and no snow at 15, so on an otherwise working system, too short a delay breaks things.\nFor 13.10, there is certainly a difference in the way the \"root\" windows are stacked up.  The 12.04 unity system has a root, child, grandchild, desktop, great great grandchild which is updates with the snow and works. (see output of\n `xwininfo -root -tree`\n\nThe 13.10 unity system actually updates the root window, and the desktop does not even have a full screen child.  With a debugger, changing the window being updated to the desktop does result in images appearing, but they erase the backgound, so not a good solution.  No other window getting the updates shows anything, so I guess it's a conflict with the unity mechanism, which looks like it does need some change for this to work (since the ideal is not to have to change anything but the xsnow program).\n\nUpdate for 14.04 running Unity\nTo see Santa, give up on the Unity desktop, and just create another X display without it.  Switch back and forth as needed, or even run programs with the -display :1 to show up on the new display.\nFirst allow anyone to run an X server\ndpkg-reconfigure x11-common\n\nand set the X access to everyone\nYes you can run with sudo, but then you will have left some root owned files on your desktop, and won't be able to login with the GUI any longer (use a virtual terminal to delete the root owned file if you do that).\nDo you have another window manager installed so you can move windows around on your new display (only if you want to run other programs there, don't bother if all you want to do is see Santa.

Here are the instructions that you should follow for dual boot installation :\nFirstly, I would recommend you to create a backup of all the data.\nInstalling Ubuntu\nIf the computer does not boot from the CD (e.g. Windows starts again instead), reboot and check your BIOS settings by pressing F2, F12, Delete, or ESC. Select \"boot from CD\".\nProceed with installation until you are asked this question: \"How do you want to partition the disk?\".\nIf you have already partitioned the disk and left space for Ubuntu, install it to that and then follow the rest of the steps.\nOtherwise, choose one of the next two steps.\nAutomatic partition resizing (recommended)\nChoose the first option, which should say \"Install them side by side, choosing between them each startup\".\nSpecify the size of the new partition by dragging the slider at the bottom of the window.\nClick on \"Forward\".\nContinue on to Finishing Ubuntu Installation\nManual partitioning\nChoose \"Manually edit partition table\".\nListed will be your current partitions.\nSelect the partition you want to resize and press Enter.\nSelect \"Size:\", press Enter.\nSelect Yes, press Enter.\nType in a new size in gigabytes for your partition, it's recommended you free up at least 10 GB of free space for your Ubuntu install. Press Enter when happy with your changes. It may take some time to apply the changes.\nCreate a swap partition of at least your amount of RAM (if you don't know, 2000 MB is a good value).\nCreate a partition for your Ubuntu installation.\nCreate other partitions if necessary.\nSelect \"Finish partitioning and write changes to disk\".\nReference : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot\nIf you face any problem please update your question to describe the problem more precisely we will be happy to help you.

I tried changing the DISPLAY variable to the ip address of my laptop followed by :0, but I could only get images to display on the remote desktop. \nIn addition, when I tried to do it the other way around and to access my laptop from my desktop, I got the message WARNING **: Could not open X display. In addition, if I don't have DISPLAY set, xterm terminal says X11 initialization failed\nFinally I tried to use SSH. First I generated a public and private key, then when I tried to connect using PuTTY with the IP address of the remote desktop and default settings.

It provides all capabilities of a  standard  X\n       server,  but  does  not connect to a display for itself.  Instead, Xvnc\n       creates a virtual desktop you can view or control remotely using a  VNC\n       viewer.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can use SSH directly with X-forwarding to relay individual application windows from the desktop to the laptop (as you apparently tried) - the most likely reasons it failed to connect are either that you don't have an SSH server running on the desktop machine (it is not installed by default); you can install it from the Software Center or from a terminal using\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nor that the SSH port is blocked by a firewall or via iptables.\nOn the client (laptop) you do not need PuTTY, it is sufficient to run the ssh client from the command line as\nssh -X your.desk.top.ip\nor, if you have some kind of DNS / mDNS running\nssh -X hostname\nNote that telnet is not secure either and best practice is to uninstall telnetd and use SSH in its place. \n", "Q: Change Password and Install VLC player I am the new user of Ubuntu.

However, I'm not that hopeful of a useful answer, given that after submitting the ticket, they showed me a page highlighting the OS support being Windows only (though they also give some guidance on the same support list for using Linux, advising 3rd-party drivers).\nMaybe we can hope for a BIOS upgrade. I didn't put an optical drive is the computer, so I'll have to burn the disk on my other computer, then take the drive out and transplant it, and so on... a real drag.\nI'm also trying each non-USB3.0 (as I know there are reasons that wouldn't work) socket. So far I've tried the two front-panel ones that I have.\nI'll update here if I either get anywhere with that, or get a useful response from support.\nUPDATE: So, I managed to get it to boot from optical with working networking and USB! The same trick might work to get the USB stick to boot, given as it's probably the wonky USB that causes that problem.

All this does is actually start the machine, it does not connect you to it in any way. \nThe only way to do that would be through VNC/Serial/SSH, but all of these are configured at guest-level.

When I try to install it the computer tells me \"missing operating system\". I changed the bios to boot from cd so that isn't the issue. Anyone have any ideas on how to make it work ?\n\nA: Some burner software will burn ISO images as a file inside a file system.  This will cause the kind of failure you are seeing. \nIf you open the DVD on the system you burned it on you should see a number of directories with names like boot, preseed, and install.  This would indicate that the ISO file was burned correctly. \nIf you see one file with the name of the ISO image you downloaded, then the burner software burned the image incorrectly. \nI usually use a USB key to boot my install systems.

I have Ubuntu 13.10 Live disc system and for some reason I can't start the System Monitor at the moment. I know it worked before, some five days ago, and since this is a Live disc system there's no chance in the world that I somehow could have screwed up any system configuration or anything. I boot it with default settings and everything. Since it is a Live disc system I could just reboot and see if it starts working again. But I use it for testing and I have all my programs and everything set up now (I did everything the same way as I did five days ago) and for this reason I refrain from rebooting because I would have to do everything all over again. I am also eager to learn why the hell it is not starting? This is not reliable, a system component or a program (whatever!) that sometimes starts and sometimes it just wont budge. Ridiculous!\nThis is how I start System Monitor:\n\n\n*\n\n*I simply click on the Ubuntu button in the upper left corner to open\nDash, type in \"monitor\" and then click on \"System Monitor\".\n\n\nWhat happens when I do that:\n\n\n*\n\n*The icon for System Monitor appears on the launcher but no\napplication window shows up, and if I click the icon on the launcher\nit doesn't do anything.\n\n\nI tried to start it from terminal and got following error.\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo gnome-system-monitor\n\n** (gnome-system-monitor:8143): WARNING **: SELinux was found but is not enabled\n.\n\n\n\nSo what now?... do I enable SELinux? How? Why?\nUpdate 1 - Installing SELinux\nI found this in Ubuntu Wiki.\n\nSELinux can be enabled in Ubuntu by installing the \"selinux\"\n  meta-package, which will make the needed changes to the system, and\n  install the Tresys policies for Ubuntu:\nsudo apt-get install selinux\nAfter installation, you will be prompted to reboot the system to label\n  and activate SELinux.\n\nWhy would I want to install it if it says it's already installed? Are there no instructions for only enabling it? Is there no way of enabling it without installing or re-installing it, and/or rebooting the computer? Is there no method of enabling it without loosing my current open processes and programs and stuff? And if it's already installed, why was it not enabled in the first place?...\n\nA: Basically the issue is not related with SELinux.\nIt is due two displays had enabled ie two monitors\nGo to System settings then go to displays \nClick on any of displays image  then toggle the on off button\nchoose keep changes on confirmation window\nIssue will be solved\nThe same issue can be shown for applications like eclipse chrome etc...\n\nA: I believe this happens because SELinux really isn't enabled, you need to load the proper modules at boot. If you check this site:\n wiki.ubuntu.com/SELinux\nIt will tell you that SELinux packages are broken in Precise (and I assume later versions) and links to this Debian tutorial instead:\nhttps://wiki.debian.org/SELinux\nIf you click on Setup on that page there is a a script and instructions for how to enable SELinux on Ubuntu:\n\nIf using Ubuntu, download this _load_selinux_policy script (this is a slightly modified version of the script included in the Ubuntu 'selinux' package), place it in /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-bottom/ then run update-initramfs -u (Upstart in Debian loads the SELinux policy automatically, but Upstart in Ubuntu does not.

So, first go to dash and search for:\n\nSoftware & Updates\n\nand open it. Then i went under tab \n\nOther Software\n\nand what i saw, gave me an answer. As Skype is \n\nCanonical partners application\n\nyou must check it to enable, also i am not sure about:\n\nCanonical partners (Source code)\n\nbut check it as well.\nAs Canonical partners software was not allowed, that is why on every skype launch it pops EULA license, as i just tryed every time to install it, and it was not allowed.\nAfter all, just close Software and Update, and wait until it completes changes and updates.

So your /etc/network/interfaces might look like\nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet static\n    wpa-ssid <my ssid>\n    wpa-psk <my psk>\n    address <address>\n    netmaks <netmask>\n    gateway <gateway>\n\n    # Command options with the same label (e.g. \"up\", \"pre-up\") are executed in the\n    #  order in which they're specified.\n    up iw reg set ...\n    up iwconfig wlan0 txpower ...\n\n    # If you have `rfkill` installed and want to disable (all) WiFi transmission\n    #  while this interface is down.\n    post-down rfkill wifi\n\nYou should also be able to use the option wireless-txpower ... since you have the wireless-tools (i.e. iwconfig) package installed, but I'm not sure how the sequencing of your commands would work in that case.

I try to put a \".\" after the name of file, but he doesnt hide. Exemple : .Firefox.desktop If i delete it, my Firefox icon in my dock can't be open. I have to hide my desktop file, Thanks !\n\nA: To show or hide a .desktop file in a given desktop environment we should use its corresponding entry keys:\nOnlyShowIn=<environment>;\nNotShowIn=<environment>;\n\nHence the follwing entry will only show the desktop file in GNOME (e.g. classic), and KDE but not in Unity:\nOnlyShowIn=GNOME;KDE;\n\nOr, alternatively we may wish to define en exclusion with\nNotShowIn=Unity;\n\n\nA: How are you renanimg this file? I've noticed that when I rename desktop files using the Nemo file manager (which is used by the third-party \"Cinnamon\" desktop), the old filename remains present in the terminal (if you open the file using a text editor, the name= field changes); I imagine the same would go for the Nautilus manager (which is used by the default desktop, on the regular flavor of Ubuntu).\nI would recommend using a terminal to change the file name. Here's an example of how you can do this: mv /path/to/Firefox.desktop /path/to/.Firefox.desktop. You can simply replace the /path/to part with the path to the Firefox.desktop file (unless of course you prefer to use cd to move straight to that directory).\nOr, you could open the file with any text editor, and use the \"Save As\" function to create a new file with a new name, and then delete the original file.\n", "Q: wifi keeps dropping on Lenovo U430 touch - Running Ubuntu 13.10 Recently I installed ubuntu 13.10 on my new Lenovo U430 Touch alongside windows 8.1\nNow wifi keeps dropping every few mins, I disable and enable wifi and then it works again, but dropped after a few mins again.\nI checked many forums and none of the suggestions seem to work.

It has an 500GB HDD, and a 24GB SSD used as cache in Windows. In Windows I disabled ExpressCache and unformatted the SSD.\nNow I am looking for reasonable way to partition my drives while installing Ubuntu to make use of the SSD.\nI looked on the internet, and there are different setups people use.\n\n\n*\n\n*Using flashcache/bcache. This is the same as ExpressCache in Windows. Advantages: Everything is cached and is cached automatically. Disadvantages: requires advanced setup; also, I'ma afraid something can break when Linux Kernel is upgraded.\n\n*Putting / on SSD and /home in HDD. Advantages: very simple and robust setup. Disadvantages: \n\nI think I would put the /home directory on the SSD, but for most directories, especially the ones with large files, I would simply have a symbolic link to whatever contains the files. This way, you can keep your settings, and the browser cache, etc on the SSD, but put the pictures, sounds, documents, etc on whatever disk you want, which can easily be changed by changing the links.\n\n\n*Putting / and /home on SSD, while making symbolic links for Downloads, Videos, .wine, etc. to HDD. Advantages: maximum cache. Disadavantages: micromanagement - to many things to fiddle with.\n\n*Where to put swap partition?\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/289202/7064\n\nAlso, if you plan for a swap partition, put in on the SSD.\n\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/62161/7064\n\nDo not put swap on the ssd. Put it on the hdd. \n\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/20154/7064\n\nI wouldn't care too much about putting a swap-partition on a SSD. The swap is, like said before, only used if there's no RAM left. But then there are \"few\" sequential writes and \"many\" random reads. That's exactly a form of usage SSDs excel in.\n\nWhat storage setup are you using? What are other advantages/disadvantages in each of the setups?\nAlso, though people say that modern SSDs are good with a lot of writes, I still don't trust them, especially as a read from my comments on my notebook that the SSD in it breakes quite often.\n\nA: The first question I'd be asking is Can the SSD be trusted as a primary drive? This was built to be a a cache drive and cache data is usually a copy of something stored elsewhere. There's no need for that data to have any integrity. Invalid data? Just rebuild off the main storage. To use it as primary storage might not be a great idea because corruption there is permanent.\nNext, Does it perform well? Cache SSDs are cheap patches to plug the hole that is the incredibly slow magnetic disk that laptops get. If it's unbranded (and there are no specs on the internet), give it a quick spin with the Disk Utility in a Live CD/USB\nIf the answer to these two is anything but \"it's fine, it's a solid disk\", I'd look at replacing it with a better mSATA (I assume that's the connection but check first!) SSD. Even ~60GB ones aren't that expensive and you can be a little more assured that they're not going to die on their first outing as a primary disk.\n\nWhere you plop your partitions is largely going to depend on how you use your system. I don't know how much user content you have versus installed applications.\nFor what it's worth, with a 120GB SSD, I have / and /home  on SSD with things symlinked and bind-mounted over to RAID5 and RAID1 and NFS. Steam allows you to store things on other media so that handles itself quite nicely. And I occasionally manually copy things to SSD for speed and symlink them.\n... But I have the space to make that possible. 24GB is really restrictive. I don't think that approach is going to work well for you.\nYou're not mentioning another option: Throw the crappy 5400RPM laptop drive into the ocean and buy a better SSD to replace it and use network storage for all the data you hold dear.\nLaptops are awful permanent storage because they get stolen, lost and dropped. It might make sense to have a centralised NFS NAS where you keep all the important stuff.\n", "Q: PowerPC No OS How to install with USB I have a PowerPC G3 that does not have an OS on it.

File systems such as ISO 9660 are stored inside one of these tracks. Since ISO images are expected to contain a binary copy of the file system and its contents, there is no concept of a \"track\" inside an ISO image, since a track is a container for the contents of an ISO image. This means that CDs with multiple tracks can't be stored inside a single ISO image; at most, an ISO image will contain the data inside one of those multiple tracks, and only if it is stored inside a standard file system.\n\n", "Q: Lubuntu.

There are mass storage drives that consist of a large HDD and a smaller part of flash memory. From the computer's point of view they act just as a normal hard drive, but internally the disk internally moves frequently used portions to the SSD part for performance increase. An example for this type of drive is the Seagate Laptop SSHD ST1000LM014.\nAre there any reported performance increases compared to a pure hard drive when using Ubuntu (or any Linux distribution for that matter) or does the internal software of the drive rely on NTFS file system features?\nSince there are no additional drivers needed I do not expect software problems, but I could not find any reports of how this works. And googling for SSHD and Linux leads to no relevant results for obvious reasons.\nPS: I hope you do not read this as a shopping recommendation. I am not looking for a specific product, but want to know whether drives with this concept are useful for Ubuntu systems?\n\nA: Yes, they do increase performance. Particularly for commonly accessed data. The drives typically cache the most accessed data in the SSD portion of the drive, However, the performance increase might be small enough that you may not visually notice it. The drives don't rely on a particular file system. The firmware calculates based on raw block access.\nThe drives however, will not necessarily be as fast as a high performance 3.5\" drive. I have a couple of Seagate SSD+HD drives, one in my workstation, and one in my PS3. I didn't choose it for performance, but power usage and size. I am sure the one in the PS3 is definitely faster than the original drive that came in it though. The download and install times for games seem to be much faster than previous, and compared to a friend's PS3 with the original drive.\n\nA: I have done similar change in my old dual-boot laptop, there was a 20-30% decrease in boot (50->40sec) and shut down time in Ubuntu 12.04, in windows the change was more dramatic, around half time needed to boot (from over 3 minutes to less than 1.5min)! \nIf you want to revive a laptop, I suggest you do it. My findings are with SATA-I controller, I suspect you get much better results if your laptop has more recent controller (SATA2/3).\n\nA: I have one HDD and two Hybrid drives and there is a huge difference in read and access times: Hybrid drives are the middle ground between HDD and \nHowever, SSDs suffer from a type of failure rate where the drive could crash and die: no lost boot sectors; just dead. Being a memory based drive it suffer memory kinks like a static discharge or a power outage. If the electric shock to the drive is large enough, you won't just lose your data: it will be wiped clean with zero chance of recovery. \nIn a Hybrid drive, if the SSD cache of the drive dies due to some malfunction/accident the data can still be recovered because it just goes from being a hybrid drive to a normal HDD (on some models). In fact if it dies while you're using it, you might not even notice the SSD cache being dead, until you run a benchmark or read/write something large from/to the drive.\n\nA: My advice to you is to use an SSD 32/64 GB for your /boot and / partitions and an HDD for /home. \nYou can either buy an mSATA SSD (if your laptop supports it) or a 2.5\" SATA SSD. In the second case you will need replace one of the drives with your CD-ROM. \nThis is how I run my laptop for 3 years and I have no issues so far. :)\n", "Q: Netbeans problem with file permisions After installing netbeans 7.40 and using it for java projects the following problem came up.\nAfter creating accidentally a class,when I try to delete it I get a message saying\nError : permission denied\n\nAnyone any idea why is this happening?\nI'm on Ubuntu 13.10.\nI installed netbeans downloading netbeans-7.4-javase-linux.sh from netbeans site.\nAlso when I cd /usr/local/netbeans-7.4/bin and sudo ./netbeans things are OK.\n\nA: well as you can easily use it with sudo ,just create a netbeans.desktop by \nsudo gedit /usr/share/applications/netbeans.desktop\n\nand then enter these lines \n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Netbeans\nComment=Netbeans IDE\nExec=env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY= netbeans\nIcon=netbeans  (or path of your icons .xpm file in the installation folder)\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nCategories=Development,IDE;\nX-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts=NewWindow\nStartupNotify=false\n[NewWindow Shortcut Group]\nName=New Window\nExec=env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY= netbeans\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\nsave it and then restart your PC once .press power key for dash and search for netbeans open it. hope it will work ,if it wont then register it as a bug as its a known issue on 13.10.\n", "Q: upgrade from lucid to precise I am running lucid, and would like to upgrade to precise.

It worked ok with Windows ; but then my windows got a bug because of a virus.\nSince then, I can only boot on Ubuntu, Windows just won't boot.\nIn the meanwhile, I can't modify anything on the part of my hard disk which is dedicated to windows ; I can read it but can't modify it, and I can't even do a new hard disk repartition.\nHow can I solve that ?\nI fear a bit that by installing a new version of Ubuntu it should cause problems.\nCan I just erase everything and install the new version of Ubuntu ?\nthanks in advance\n\nA: yes, you can just format the drive which u installed ubuntu and install it freshly.\n\nA: If you're using parted, GParted, or any other libparted-based program for partitioning, you can't modify in-use partitions. You can modify some partitions by unmounting them. GParted lets you do this -- right-click the partition and select \"Unmount\" from the menu. You can't unmount your Linux root (/) partition, though, so if you need to modify it, you'll need to boot with an emergency disc (the Ubuntu installer in its \"try before installing\" mode should work fine for this).\nThat said, the problems you've described are all Windows problems, and it's not clear to me that repartitioning will solve your problems. Chances are you can't write to the Windows partition from Linux because it was not properly unmounted. The only way to fix this problem is by running CHKDSK (or its GUI equivalents) from Windows. Because Windows won't boot, this puts you in a bit of a bind -- but as with resizing partitions with GParted, an emergency disc is the solution. This time, though, it must be a Windows emergency disc. I don't happen to have any URLs handy, but a Web search should turn them up. (Be wary, though; I'd be shocked if there are no third-party Windows recovery discs with malware. Download only from Microsoft or some other trusted source.)\nAlternatively, if you don't want to keep Windows, you can use your existing read-only access to transfer your user files off of the Windows partition and then use GParted or mkfs to turn it into a Linux partition. You might even follow this procedure to convert that space into a separate /home partition, which will make it safer and easier to do a fresh Linux installation without damaging your user files.\n", "Q: Trackpoint and Clickpad: enable buttons and scroll (Lenovo T440s) I just got a Lenovo T440s which is equiped with synaptics touchpad. By default there's no middle button and right button is at right bottom corner of touchpad.

Ubuntu 13.10 comes with it, so you don’t need to update driver in that case. However, what made all of this possible is the latest release of intel-virtual-output tool, which comes bundled with xf86-video-intel driver source. But, ubuntu’s package does not bundle it, and we need to compile it from source. One MAJOR thing to note here is: DO NOT compile it from ubuntu’s deb-src package. That package is old, and current release has some major fixes for the tool that we will actually need in order to have everything working properly. So lets do it:\nsudo apt-get install xorg-dev git git \nclone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/xorg/driver/xf86-video-intel \ncd xf86-video-intel  \n./autogen.sh  \ncd tools \nmake  \nsudo cp intel-virtual-output /usr/bin/  \nsudo chmod +x /usr/bin/intel-virtual-output\n\nTaken from here: http://www.unixreich.com/blog/2013/linux-nvidia-optimus-on-thinkpad-w520w530-with-external-monitor-finally-solved/\n\nA: I managed to build the intel-virtual-output tool with following commands:\n# get all official build dependencies\nsudo apt-get build-dep xserver-xorg-video-intel\n\n# make sure all undocumented dependecies are installed as well\nfor l in xinerama xrandr xdamage xfixes xcursor xtst xrender xext x11 pixman-1 ; do echo lib$l-dev ; done | xargs -n99 sudo apt-get -y install\n\ncd ~ # or wherever you want\n\n# get the source\napt-get source xserver-xorg-video-intel\ncd xserver-xorg-video-intel\n\n# tell dpkg-buildpackage to include the binary into the package\necho \"usr/bin/intel-virtual-output\" >> debian/xserver-xorg-video-intel.install\n\n# build the package\ndpkg-buildpackage -b\n\n# check the ouput\nls -l ./debian/tmp/usr/bin/intel-virtual-output # this is your binary\n\nInstall it by just coping your bin to /usr/local/bin or by installing the deb package you just build.\n", "Q: How can I remove a HDD from the \"Devices\" list in the file browser?

Nautilus doesn't offer such functionality hence you may have to use some Filesystem tools to make your wishes true.\n\nA: Have you tried right-clicking on it, and hitting \"remove?\" If that doesn't work, then it may be corrupted. Ubuntu has a funky way of dealing with corrupted HDD's (I have experience :)) If it's a partition, then there's no way to \"physically\" remove it from the system.

I read how to set the default OS choice for GRUB (How do I set the grub timeout and the grub default boot entry?) and I did that, but since I often work from home, I'd like to switch from Windows 7 to Ubuntu 13 and from Ubuntu 13 to Windows 7 automatically by VNC.\nI can edit manually the file /etc/default/grub, but I can't do the sudo update-grub from inside the Windows environment.\nMy question is: is there any way to do this from inside a Windows environment or to use a workaround to be able to change the default bootloader choice and boot into another operating system remotely ?\n\nA: The default menu choice is (or can be) stored in the GRUB \"environment block\", a little 1024 byte file that lives in /boot/grub/grubenv by default. You could easily put that on a drive accessible from both Windows and Linux (e.g. a FAT or NTFS partition) and modify it accordingly. I've done this already one-way (Linux -> Windows) for my mother's laptop using a little script:\n#! /bin/bash\nsudo /usr/sbin/grub-set-default 0\nnohup bash -c \"sleep 15s && sudo /sbin/reboot\" &\ngnome-session-quit --no-prompt --logout\n\nAlso added the following to /etc/sudoers to make the necessary commands execute without prompting:\n%adm ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/grub-set-default, /sbin/reboot\n\nAlternatively, it looks like someone may already have done the heavy lifting:\nhttp://de.mcbf.net/david/grubchoosedefault/\nHaven't tried this yet though ..\n\nA: About 20 years ago my OS/2 did that. Knowing a bit more about boot processes, I do not know exactly how it did that. \nIt may have had boot loaders in PBR - partition boot sector and just moved boot flag. Or it may have just dd'd the boot sector/MBR with a different version. Those might work now.\nBut it might be easier just to install grub2 to a separate NTFS grub2 only boot partition. Then you can edit grub.cfg directly from both Windows and Linux. While you could edit the grub.cfg, I might just make 3 grub configs, working, Windows boot & Linux boot. And just have scripts to copy either Windows boot or Linux boot to the working copy.\nThen no update grub required.\nOn one of my flash drives that I originally created as a Windows 7 repair flash drive, I over-installed grub2 so from same flash drive I could directly boot other Linux repair ISO via loopmount. The only issue with grub installed in Windows is making sure you do not create /Boot & /boot as then you have major issues. I had /BCD & /grub in one /Boot folder.\nSo you might not even have to have a separate grub only partition, but have to be careful not to damage Windows.\n", "Q: Share 13.10 & win 8 cpu's on home network?

I even did a Java program. \nWhen I shut down Eclipse and ran it again later, I got the error message below. Thinking I did something wrong on the install, I uninstalled it and removed all traces of Eclipse. Then I reinstalled it, ran Eclipse and all was great. \nIt ran normally for a couple days. Then I shut down the computer and restarted it a few hours later. Eclipse gave that same error message again, the Invalid Configuration Location error. So something goes awry after the initial running of Eclipse and prevents further executions of the program.\nThis error message is generated when I run Eclipse (Kepler) in Kubuntu 13.10. It shows up right after the Eclipse splash screen disappears:\n**Invalid Configuration Location**\nLocking is not possible in the directory \"/opt/eclipse/configuration/org.eclipse.osgi\".

To do this I have installed ImageMagic and am trying to execute the command: \nconvert -delay 10 -loop 0 inputfiles*.png animaion.gif\n\nI have a lot of image files that I am trying to combine so I don't really want to type them all out individually, is there anyway I can execute this command as some sort of loop, or alternatively a better method of creating an animation from these images? \nI have written a program to output all the file names so I can just copy and paste them into the terminal, this works but if anyone knows a better way to do this it would be helpful.\nThanks\n\nA: If I understand correctly, if you have mypgrogram that outputs the list of filenames, you should be able to simply do\nconvert -delay 10 -loop 0 $(myprogram) animation.gif\n\nThe $(...) operator is a bash shell operation that runs the indicated command and then replaces itself with the output (more or less... the shell is a quite powerful tool).\n", "Q: CPU frequency scaling on Ubuntu and Windows Linux reports my CPU's maximum frequency as 2.40 GHz and min as 1.2 GHz. Windows 8's Task Manager shows the CPU frequency going above 3.0 GHz or below 1.0 GHz on occasion, according to usage. This is something I have noticed in 12.10, 13.04, and 13.10, as well as Arch Linux.\nI have a 3rd-gen Corei7-3630QM CPU @2.40 GHz, according to lshw -c cpu.\nAnybody know how Windows gets to the larger range of frequencies?\nWhat will happen if I force set the maximum and minimums to more extreme values, by doing something like:\nfor file in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq\ndo\n      echo 3001000 > $file\ndone\n\nRight now the exact maximum frequency in all /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq files is 2401000.\n\nA: It is Intel Turbo Boost in action. One of the cores can go higher freq. when it is necessary and the other go low. Like for example : you have a process, that uses 70% of only one core of CPU, so you processor raises this core' frequency and makes other cores lower theirs in order to stay in TDP - not to overheat. I am not sure if it is implemented on OS level, or on hardware level. But anyway, do not worry, if you try to set a higher or lower range of frequencies on Linux- you WILL NOT FRY your CPU. No way  there are safeties built in. You can't just make a mobile CPU run faster than it can. It is not a CORE-I7 EXTREME series \n", "Q: How to dual boot OSX and Ubuntu without having to delete and reinstall Ubuntu in a Dell laptop? I am trying to install OSX Lion on my Dell studio with Ubuntu being the current and only operating system.  Is there a way to dual boot without having to delete and reinstall Ubuntu?\n\nA: Actually, a solution there is. I made a similar question on this site here:\nSet Ubuntu partition back to active and boot with Chameleon\nThe difference is that I've done a triple boot, not dual, which is harder on just a HDD. This is what you have to do.\n\n\n*\n\n*Prepare your OS X DVD (prepared with Unibeast or something like which works on PCs, a DVD is always preferable than a USB for further bootloaders issues)\n\n*On Ubuntu, make a partition to your drive of the space you want OS X to be and format it as FAT32 (it will be changed after, but in this way the installer finds it)\n\n*Boot your OS X DVD and install it on the partition (formatted as Journaled, but you can find these things in guides)\n\n*After you installed all the drivers, install the bootloader which will replace the GRUB (I used Enoch)\n\n*If you are not able to see Ubuntu at start of PC in the list of OSes, run Ubuntu Live CD, install BootRepair and set back Ubuntu as active partition, then set the partition of Mac OSX to run as first.\n\n*If everything goes well, you will be able to dual boot at start. (Remember that you can custom your bootloader preferences from an app, for example it at defaults runs OSX in 2 seconds if you don't press F8 key, while I chose to show immediately the OS list.\n\n\nThis thing is easier for you than how much it was for me, since Windows, Ubuntu and OS X use 3 different bootloaders and I installed them on the same HDD.\nEDIT Notes:\nAlways keep these 2 things post-installation, you may always need them.\n- An external OSX bootloader, if you have troubles with Enoch or Chameleon on HDD, you can always boot with DVD until you solve your issues (like I did)\n- A Ubuntu Live CD for using BootRepair to solve issues you do or change partition priority to run.\n\nA: The answer is simple: You can't install OSX in a non-Apple system. It just doesn't work. \n\nApple systems check for a specific chip and refuse to run or install without it - this is called the system management controller, and in effect is a glorified fan controller amongst other things.\n\nOf course, there is a workaround for everything but that doesn't mean that you wouldn't have another piece of hardware that doesn't work or behaves strangely.\nApart the fact that the installation may nuke your boot loader and/or Ubuntu partition.\nReference:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://superuser.com/a/679911/235569\n", "Q: dmesg gives PM-Timer Bug Command dmesg on my PC gives e.g. following:\n[    0.123440] pci 0000:00:1f.0: [8086:24c0] type 0 class 0x000601\n[    0.123446] * The chipset may have PM-Timer Bug.

I wouldn't bother with it:\n\nThe Low Pin Count bus, or LPC bus, is used on IBM-compatible personal computers to connect low-bandwidth devices to the CPU, such as the boot ROM and the \"legacy\" I/O devices (behind a super I/O chip). The \"legacy\" I/O devices usually include serial and parallel ports, PS/2 keyboard, PS/2 mouse, floppy disk controller and—more recently—the Trusted Platform Module (TPM). The physical wires of the LPC bus usually connect to the southbridge chip on a PC motherboard, which contains the circuit equivalents of the \"legacy\" onboard peripherals of the IBM PC/AT architecture, such as the two programmable interrupt controllers, the programmable interval timer, and the two ISA DMA controllers.\n\nUnless your TPM requires it and/or your system is giving you headaches related with any of those devices I wouldn't touch it.\n", "Q: Sublime Text 2 broken package Whenever I try executing Sublime Text 2 from my terminal by typing sublime-text, it give the following:\n/usr/bin/sublime-text: line 3: /opt/sublime_text_2/sublime_text: No such file or directory\n\nMoreover, there are two icons in the menu, none of which work.\nThese are the following things I tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Autoremove\n\n*Reinstallation\n\n*apt-get upgrade\n\n\nBut none of these seem to work. What should I do?\n\nA: Running the following should work to reinstall Sublime Text 2, and install Sublime Text 3:\nsudo rm -rf /opt/sublime_text_2 /usr/bin/sublime-text\n# this will remove the old install directory and execution script\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/sublime-text-2\n# add the ST2 repository\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/sublime-text-3\n# same for ST3\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install sublime-text sublime-text-installer\n# install ST2 and ST3, respectively\n\nYou should now be able to run sublime-text from the command line to start ST2, and subl to start ST3. As always, please keep in mind the following:\n\nSublime Text may be downloaded and evaluated for free, however a license must be purchased for continued use.\n\n", "Q: how to open technicLauncher.jar in ubuntu I am completely new to ubuntu.

Again I am completely new and do not understand all the ubuntu terminology but i am computer literate and can generally be told specifics and get it done. thank you so much \n\nA: To open .jar file you need to have installed Java. Then you need to open .jar file with java. ( Change the Open With .. option in right click menu to the Java package you have installed.)\nIf you havent installed Java, you can installed by following :\nPress Ctrl+Alt+T : You will get the Terminal with prompt.

I went through the install process perfectly and BT was working very well. \nI then restarted my system and booted up into Windows. I went into disk management, because I was curious about what partition BT was installed on, and by mistake I deleted the partition that it was installed on. \nI thought there was nothing on this partition and was really stupid not to check how much space had been used on the drive. Anyways, I restarted my computer and came up to the screen that says: \n\"error: unknown file system Grub rescue>!!!!!!\n\nThis is EASY to fix, I had it once before with Linux Mint.

As you say you know the typical key for your laptop, give this a try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off your laptop.\n\n*Disconnect the mains power connection to your laptop.\n\n*Remove the battery (if possible) from your laptop.\n\n*Give it a minute, then plug the battery back in.\n\n*Switch on the laptop and immediately keep pressing F2 to see if it lets you in.\n\n\nThanks\n", "Q: Ubuntu hangs after grub while installation my computer was working fine.\nI installed unetbooting and I wanted to installed windows 7 to my usb . \nSo I opened unetboot and my USB was formated to fat 32 and selected the windows 7 iso with my USB.\nThen I restarted my laptop with the USB plunged in. unetboot showed up but there was no iso to select so I just switched off my computer by holding the hardware boot button. and then restarted my computer. grub loaded and allowed me to make my selection but when I clicked Ubuntu it would stay on the black terminal thing and won't boot.\nI tried the recovery but that won't load either.

As a summary: I wanted to install the latest SCilab, which is not available in the Software centre. I downloaded the tar.gz file from the website. I then followed the instructions from response 7 here How do I install a .tar.gz (or .tar.bz2) file?. This didn't work for me.  So I removed the file (I think), and extracted the file a different way and ran the program from there.\nOkay, so I downloaded Scilab from their website as a tar.gz file.\nI then copied the file to /opt:\n sudo cp [download name].tar.gz /opt/ \nI then extraced the file and deleted the tar.gz file:\n sudo tar -xvf [download name].tar.gz\nsudo rm -rf [download name].tar.gz \nI found the folder. It was called Scilab-5.4.1. I think the next step changes the \"access\" settings, and so I changed it as follows:\n sudo chmod 770 Scilab-5.4.1/ \nSo this is owner and group permission to read, write and execute.\nI then tried the symbolic link thing:\n sudo ln -s /opt/Scilab-5.4.1/ /usr/bin/scilab \nAfter this, I tried different ways to run the programme from the terminal, but to no avail. I then looked for the Scilab folder, which I found in opt. I tried to delete the folder \"Windows-style\" (send to recycling bin) but it wouldn't let me. I also tried purge from the terminal but it couldn't find the programme. I then used:\n sudo rm -r /opt/Scilab-5.4.1 \nThe folder disappeared. After this, I downloaded the file again, and transferred it to opt in the process:\n sudo tar xzvf [download name].tar.gz -C /opt/ \nI then went to the folder (in terminal):\n cd /opt/scilab-5.4.1 \nAnd opened Scilab:\n ./bin/scilab \nThis seems to work. However, there is a Scilab programme logo in the launcher (Unity), but it disappears on closing the programme and there is no logo in the recently used programmes section in the dash. \nI want to know that was there an error in my installing process done in the previous unsuccessful install, since I can't find the Scilab logo anywhere ? \nWhy first method didn't work but the second, simpler method, seemed to work okay (I can at least open the programme) ? \n(The final peculiar thing is my \"history\" in the terminal: using the up-arrow to navigate to previous commands, the history suggests I didn't use rm -r, even though I am almost certain I did.)\n\nA: To make Scilab present in the path, you must modify your symbolic link creation to:\nsudo ln -s /opt/Scilab-5.4.1/bin/scilab /usr/bin/scilab\n\nThat way you can type scilab in the shell and open it. For creating the icon:\ngedit ~/.local/share/applications/scilab.desktop\nNow add the following content:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Scilab\nComment=Scilab-5.4.1\nExec=/usr/bin/scilab\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=true\n\nNow you can pin it to the dash or just searching for \"Scilab\".\n", "Q: Computer won´t run after upgrading to13.10 I just upgraded from 13.04 to 13.10, and after the upgrade was done and the computer started rebooting it just didn´t.

Any help would be appreciated.\n\nA: You could try using a Ubuntu USB and try Ubuntu instead of installing it. from there although this is just a guess, you may be able to hook up an external HDD and access the files on your disk then do a clean install which would honestly save you the time and trouble.

If you have a newer computer which is capable of booting off of a USB drive, you can follow these instructions to create a bootable Ubuntu USB drive using Pen Drive Linux.\nIf you do not have access to a USB drive, or your computer cannot boot off of one, you can create a bootable CD or DVD, which will work on almost all computers.

Do I need to extract them all on my PC (Windows 7) and then burn them all or just the OS (I gues the big files) Thanks much.\n\nA: It is an iso or image file. If you do not have CD / DVD burning software installed, windows defaults to (mis) identifying the file as a .zip file.\nYou do not extract anything, you either burn a DVD or make a live flash drive. Live flash is more modern (I have not burned a DVD in more then 4 years).\nSee:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\nand\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto\n\nA: If you want to burn it to a CD or DVD you need a program that can burn ISO files\nI suggest Imgburn for windows which can be found here:\nhttp://www.filehippo.com/download_imgburn/\njust click the \"download latest version\" link next to the green arrow on the right side of the screen\nOnce you download imgburn install the program\nAfter you install it run the program and you will come to a screen with many different options\n(bear with me as im typing this from memory and not using the program because i cant on linux)\nChoose burn iso to disk and then insert your cd or dvd\nwhere it shows the path for the iso click the folder icon on the right of the path bar\nselect the iso that you downloaded\nonce you do that select the burn option on the bottom of the screen and it will start buring\nRule of thumb with burning ISO's:\nThe slower the burn speed the less room the program has to make errors. although I usally just leave to at max and never had a problem is your not sure then set the speed to 1x or 2x.\nMaking a Ubuntu USB:\nfollow the instructions here:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\nhope this helps\nif you still dont get it email me at lf61891@gmail.com and i can put together a quick video on how to do it.

Instead, it displays a graphic file that has the version number as part of the image: /usr/share/gnome-control-center/ui/UbuntoLogo.png. \nApparently, on your factory installed system, when an upgrade is performed, this graphic file is not replaced; so Details continues to show the version that was originally installed.\n\nA: To extend chaskes's answer, I looked up the package containing the offending file, which turned out to be gnome-control-center-data.

My bluetooth dongle wouldn't work out of the box, so I had to do the following:\nmodprobe btusb\necho \"050d 065a\" >> /sys/bus/usb/drivers/btusb/new_id\n\nAfter that I can pair the remote fine using Bluetooth Manager from the GUI. It's registered looking like a normal PS3 remote, according to bt-device:\nroot@server:/dev/input# bt-device -i \"BD Remote Contol\"\n[00:04:20:E8:B4:B4]\n  Name: BD Remote Contol\n  Alias: BD Remote Contol [rw]\n  Address: 00:04:20:E8:B4:B4\n  Icon: undefined\n  Class: 0x250c\n  Paired: 1\n  Trusted: 1 [rw]\n  Blocked: 0 [rw]\n  Connected: 1\n  UUIDs: [HumanInterfaceDevice, PnPInformation, 00001800-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb]\n\nI can see packages coming from bluetooth for every key press like this:\nroot@server:/dev/input# hcidump -x -i hci0\nHCI sniffer - Bluetooth packet analyzer ver 2.5\ndevice: hci0 snap_len: 1500 filter: 0xffffffffffffffff\n> ACL data: handle 11 flags 0x02 dlen 17\n    L2CAP(d): cid 0x0041 len 13 [psm 0]\n      A1 01 00 00 00 00 FF FF FF FF FF 01 05 \n> ACL data: handle 11 flags 0x02 dlen 17\n    L2CAP(d): cid 0x0041 len 13 [psm 0]\n      A1 01 00 00 00 FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 05 \n\nSo the pairing is definitely ok and key presses are received.

Whether you're\n  at home behind a common router, at work behind an enterprise firewall,\n  or traveling, chances are that you will be behind a NAT which must be\n  traversed before making calls.\nOur server, Numb, will help your SIP phone automatically punch holes\n  in the NAT.

STUN and TURN\n  do not know about ICE and those protocols are just cubicles in the\n  general ICE picture. When you are using ICE, you have to set all the\n  components (including STUN and TURN) to work together. This TURN\n  server has all means to set it up correctly in any environment.

Via mouse actions and keyboard shortcuts you can snap the active window to various preset locations (left half of screen, upper right quarant, etc).  However, these keyboard shortcuts only work on the active display (i.e. you can't move the window out of the current display using any of these).\n\"Put\" allows you to use a keyboard shortcut to move the active window from the current display to another one.  It works great, UNLESS you've previously used the grid plugin to snap the window into place.  In this case, the window will move to the new display as desired, but then about 1 second later it will bounce back.  To be clear: the window will only move across screens via the \"put\" keyboard shortcut, if that window was NOT previously snapped to a preset \"grid\" location.\nHas anybody else experienced this?  Any ideas for a solution?\n\nA: well, i didnt understand what you meant by window, but i believe the case is you want to bring an open file to a new window on your selectory? well i have had this experience in which i discovered add the window selector to your taskbar and then drag your file to the bar, it will open the four windows and then allow you to place the file\n", "Q: `apt-get upgrade` stalls with zombie `dpkg` - what to do? During an apt-get upgrade on a server, output stalled and in investigation I found a zombie dpkg process, but the apt-get process still alive. What is the best way to handle this? The dpkg log shows the last operation apparently completed successfully (\"status installed ...).\nA potential cause is that the ssh session in which I did apt-get upgrade is from a (local) terminal running in byobu and at the same time there is a lot of network traffic from my local machine to the server.  \nedit: Perhaps a more likely cause is a sluggish virtual hard disk (the server is a cloud instance)..\n\nA: I saw the same stalling behaviour of apt-get (used synaptic) and saw the zombie dpkg process.

I have a VM installed in my windows 7 PC, and I want to install an Ubuntu 13.04 on it, as a new virtual disk.\nI have this machine:\n\nIntel Core i7-2600k CPU @ 3.40Ghz - 8 GB RAM - 64 bit operating system\n\nI get this message: \n\nKernel requires x86-64 CPU, but only detects i686\n\nWhy is this? I think I´m missing something really silly here...\n\nA: Check to see if your VM's cpu has any additional features enabled like VT (virtualization technology), as well as if the machine is running in BIOS or EFI mode (In virtualbox these are all listed in under CPU, however in VMware player only some are listed the rest can only be configured by editing the vm config file manually in notepad. The best option is to have all such things turned OFF unless you really need them, which is the default setting of most VM softwares.\nCheck to make sure you choose the correct VM type, for example in VMware Player you would choose Ubuntu 64 rather than Ubuntu when deciding what type of VM profile to use.\nIf the issues persist, try uninstalling the VM software and re-installing (or if possible updating to a new release). \nLast but not least check you HOST bios or uefi, MANY VM PROGRAMS REQUIRE VT or VT-x etc to be enabled on the host to run 64bit vms.\n\nA: I know it may sound stupid but I was having the same issue with Virtual Box.\nIf you do not select the Ubuntu x64 for the operating system drop-down (ie you might have selected just Ubuntu, there should be two options for the Ubuntu distribution).

Installed 12.04 64 bit via USB onto 3TB SATA drive. Upon completion, reboot and it drops into BIOS. If I install same on an older 1TB drive, it works fine.\nChecking the two disks, the 3TB has a 1MB partition at the start, type unknown, whereas the 1TB has the boot partition. Booted from the 1TB and ran disk repair on the 3TB drive. Complete successfully, but trying it by itself, it does not boot (and gparted shows the same 1MB partition).\nHere is the report: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6461458/\nAny idea as to why Ubuntu is not installing correctly not this disk?\nAny suggestions to resolve?\nIf there is another post on this, please let me know - I searched and could not find something similar.\nThanks!\nUpdate: after install, Ubuntu does not boot, but moving drive to another system works. If I install Windows 8 on the 3TB drive, it boots fine. If I then try to install Ubuntu 12.04 for dual boot, it does not see the Windows OS.  Any ideas?\n\nA: I think that it is installing correctly, but many BIOS do not support hard drives above the size of 2TB. I would check the website for the motherboard manufacture, and see if it is compatible with large Hard Drives. Then update the BIOS if an update is available. If not, you might have to call customer support for your motherboard manufacturer. They MIGHT be able to help. It is worth a try. \nGood Luck,\nBrooks Rady\n\nA: There was a grub bug that they supposedly fixed for / (root) partitions over some very large size like 500GB. You have a massive / partition. I might suggest a 25GB / partition and use the rest of the drive as /home or as data partition(s). Just because we now have these monster multi-TB drives does not mean root should be that size. \nNot that grub is at 2.5TB and vmlinuz is at .5. Your drive has to jump all over just to boot. Better if all system files are somewhat closer together in a smaller / partition.\n\nA: Didn't find a direct answer to why Ubuntu didn't boot on the 3TB disk, but did work on a 1TB drive, but I was able to install Windows 8 and then setup for dual boot with Ubuntu 12.04, and I think it gives some hints to the issue.\nWith the working solution, I had my BIOS set for compatibility mode=auto and preferring UEFI over legacy. When I installed Windows, the BIOS reports the drive as UEFI and I see a EFI partition. When I did Ubuntu, the DVD did the alternate boot (grub like display) that represented a UEFI boot. I had changed secure boot to Other OS, and I added partitions and installed Ubuntu.\nI think with the original try I had it booting the Ubuntu installer as a legacy device. I installed Windows, but could not get Ubuntu to see Windows on later installs, I tried to reinstall windows and it complained of a GPT partition that was corrupt. So, I think I was mixing Secure Boot and Not, and UEFI and legacy.\nSince my end goal was dual boot, I've got that going now. The source of this question was an early try where I was to just put on Ubuntu, while I was waiting to get Windows.\n", "Q: Change keyboard layout when running from USB I run Ubuntu 12.04 temporarily from USB made with unetbootin (because not allowed to install to this machine).\nMachine has Finnish keyboard.

Upgrading from such an old version would be ridiculous. It would use less of your bandwidth if you just downloaded the version you want, and your installation would be a lot more stable with a clean install.\n\nA: Your best bet is to make a clean install of either Ubuntu 12.04(Long Term Support) or 13.10(latest stable) otherwise you would need to upgrade from 9.04 to 9.10, 10.04 and from this you can jump to 12.04 since both are LTS releases.\nIf you still insist to upgrade thru all versions then you will have to follow all the instructions here:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades \nIf you choose to make a clean install this can be an opportunity to make a separate partition for /home/ so if a future upgrade goes wrong or you just simply want to try a new ubuntu release and avoid going thru update or even anoher linux distro you can easily keep your data. \nhttp://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/installseparatehome\n", "Q: How to extract matrices from QtOctave to LibreOffice Calc?

My current system is Ubuntu 13.10 64-bit with kernel 3.11.\n\nA: Anything you install outside of Ubuntu oficial repositories you are on your own.\nIf it works for you, good.\nAccording to the Ubuntu wiki on mainline builds\n\nThe mainline kernels builds are produced for debugging purposes and therefore come with no support.

I'm making an upstart job, and I need to run an executable as another user.  Nothing fancy like su provides, and none of the mixed-up SELinux contexts that come along with it.  A quick internet search recommends runuser over su for this task, but runuser is nowhere to be found on Ubuntu 13.10.\nShould I be using su on Ubuntu--will it be smart enough to avoid full authorization?  Would a resulting job be portable to other distros, or will I run into SELinux issues?\nUltimately, what's the best way to change users in an upstart job?\nUpdate\nApparently upstart >= 1.4 supports setuid and setgid, but they're limited in that they affect all of the job pre-*/post-* scripts, not just the primary script/exec.  It'd still be nice to have a way to properly drop to another user for a single command.  I've considered using stop-start-daemon, but it overlaps too much with upstart and will likely cause expect to behave oddly.\n\nA: There is a bug report regarding this problem.\nSuggested work around the the limitation is to create a separate jobs to handle the pre/post conditions whilst running as root. You would need to correctly setup start/stop conditions: Job emulating pre stanza (pre-job.conf) would have to start on conditions defined currently for your job (main-job.conf), your current job will have to run on pre-job started, job emulating post stanza (post-job.conf) will have to start on main-job stopped.  \n", "Q: Can no longer press Windows key to launch Dash, what to do?

Tried rebooting with Windows recovery disc but same thing. \nHave I lost my PC?\n\nA: You should select Install Ubuntu alongside other systems (Windows in your case) when presented with Preparing to installation dialogue box during Ubuntu installation.\n- If you have chosen this option during install, give a try to boot-repair tool to fix your Grub entries. \nIf you have selected erase disk and install Ubuntu instead, I am afraid you may have lost your Windows installation already, with only Ubuntu present on your PC now.\nRefer to this answer to get more information.\n\nSince you say that you have selected Install Ubuntu alongside other systems, looks like you may be facing the RAID problem as mentioned here. I am outlining their solution to this problem here too -\nUbuntu seems to have marked one or more of your partitions as RAID. \n\n\n*\n\n*To fix it first turn off RAID in your bios. \n\n*Then load up Ubuntu from liveDVD / liveUSB and open gparted. If you get a drive with a funny name like nvidia_ahahdhjdfsjkf then you have mounted a RAID drive that you don't want.\n\n*To get rid of it, Open a terminal and run:\n$ sudo dmraid -E -r /dev/name_of_your_disk\n\n\n*\n\n*Note : you want the disk name not the partition name. You can see your disk names in gparted. e.g. if disk names are sda and sdb and partition names are sda1, sda5 and sdb1, then you have to do both sda and sdb.\n\n\n*Restart gparted. Once you have erased the RAID meta data you should see the funny named disk disappear.\n\n*Once you have verified the RAID disk is gone reboot and your Windows OS should boot.\n\n\nSource : Ubuntu Forums - Ubuntu has forced sda into a RAID\n", "Q: Installation and configuration of Java 3D in ubuntu My java 3d project using netbeans is running fine in my windows environment.

One is /bin/bash and other is /bin/dash. And /bin/sh is actually a softlink of /bin/dash. To verify it, write in terminal,\nwhich sh\n\nyou will get output: /bin/sh\nNext type ls -l /bin/sh in terminal, which will return something like,\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 May 16 20:23 /bin/sh -> dash\n\nWhich shows the fact that sh is a softlink of /bin/dash. you can try further which dash. \nActually bash is sh with more features and better syntax. Both of them have almost same commands, but they are different.\nWhat is happening here\nWhen you are running sh emp1.sh then script is handled by dash but when you run ./emp1.sh due to the shebang line(#!/bin/bash) on top of the script bash shell handles it. So you get slight different formatting in output. Keep in mind bash has some improved syntax.\n\nA: The output is different because you are using two different programs.\nIn the first case sh emp1.sh you start a program named sh and tell it to execute the instructions in emp1.sh. That program sh is probably the bourne shell (sh), a bourne again shell (bash) trying to emulate the classic shell (and thus reacting differently from its native mode), dash or even anything else.\nWhen you use ./emp1.sh you try to execute the script empt1.sh itself. Its first line contains a shebang and an interpreter (#!/bin/bash) telling it that it needs to use bash (and all its features). \nThat means you use a different program/mode than in the first case. And you get different output.\nTo verify this, try one of these two:\n\n\n*\n\n*/bin/bash emp1.sh  (which should produce the same output as the ./emp1.sh)\n\n*Or change the first line to #!/bin/sh.\n\n", "Q: How to log into lxc container?

Every time I connect it to my computer it gets automatically mounted. While removing it I select safely remove option rather than unmount because I read somewhere that it is recommended.\nI have two questions:-\n\n\n*\n\n*Is true that just unmounting can damage my hard disk. Should I always select safely remove option? (I know the difference between unmount and safely remove and I have also noted that unmounting removes it from file table entry but safely removing actually stops using it. The power supply LED goes off after safely removing which doesn't happen with unmount).\n\n*The first question leads me to this!\nHow do I `safely remove my hard disk from command line?\n(I know how to umount it.. but even if I unmount it it is still shown in fdiks -l\nI don't want that)\n\nA: Try this.  Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo umount /dev/<device_id> \n\n\naddition/correction (if you want to go by device uuid, i.e. not something like \"sda3\" but rather its unique long numeric/hex string like \"366A52F225612...\") use\nsudo umount /dev/disk/by-uuid/<device_id>\n\n\nOr you can use udisks. \nsudo udisksctl unmount /dev/<device_id>\n\nYou can get the device ID using sudo fdisk -l command\nTo install udisks if not installed, just do\nsudo apt-get install udisks\n\nFor more info see the udisks manpage\n\nA: Ubuntu comes with  Udisks daemon, which allows mounting/unmounting , and doing several other things with block devices (aka drives) without need for sudo as in the case of mount commands. Of particular interest is the options for detaching/powering-off the drive. \nFor newer releases, use udisksctl command, specifically this sequence:\nudisksctl unmount -b /dev/sdc1 && udisksctl power-off -b /dev/sdc                                                                                  \n\nOlder versions of Ubuntu (13.10 and earlier) can use the following\nudisks --unmount /dev/sdb1 && udisks --detach /dev/sdb\n\nIn both commands the idea is the same: the command both unmounts and then powers-down the device(if your USB device has LED, no LED will be flashing and it won't show up in udisksctl status or df).\nFor convenience, both of these commands could be made a function in ~/.bashrc , for instance:\ndrive_off(){\n    # Function that unmounts and powers off a USB drive\n    # Usage example: drive_off /dev/sdc1\n    device=$(awk '{print substr($0,0,length($0)-1)}' <<< \"$1\")\n    udisksctl unmount -b \"$1\" && udisksctl power-off -b \"$device\"\n}\n\nReference: ubuntuforums.org\nAlso, refer to udisks manual page through terminal for more info: man udisks\n\nA: *\n\n*Unmounting won't damage your disk or data. Unplugging it while it is still in use can corrupt the data. Unmounting it will generally also sync the filesystem which makes it safe to eject the disk. Check the led for activity. If you want to be totaly sure there is the command sync which, according to the man page, forces  changed  blocks to disk and updates the super block.\n\n*Apparently its not safe for some devices to unplug them when they are on. So the to be absolutely safe some file managers give the option to remove the device from the system entirely.  \n\nA: Run this command to get your device path:\nlsblk\n\nA command to unmount a drive would be:\nudisksctl unmount -b /dev/$DEVICE\n\n\nA: These also work (14.04):\n\n$ udisks --mount  /dev/sdi1\n$ udisks --unmount  /dev/sdi1\n\nNOTED: no need to 'sudo' and both of\n\n$ udisks --unmount \n$ udisksctl unmount\n\nleaves the LED lit on my Sandisk Imagemate (USB3.0 card reader).\nOther ways to find out devices\n\nblkid -o list\nls -lR /dev/disk/\n\n", "Q: Trying to install Ubuntu on computer via cd; no bootable device I'm trying to install Ubuntu on my desktop computer, a Dell Inspiron 530, intel core 2 duo.

In such cases, manual methods, in part /etc/network/interfaces, are the methods used to set up networking. On the other hand, in a desktop installation, one with the networking applet, Network Manager controls networking, not manual methods. \nIn such cases, in order to set a static IP, right-click the applet, also known as the Network Manager icon and select Edit Connections. Edit eth0, in your case, and select IPv4. Change the method to Manual. Fill in your selections and don't forget DNS nameservers. In most cases, the address of the router is sufficient for DNS.

research on the topic.\nProblem\nI dual-booted a pre-installed Windows 8 laptop with Ubuntu 13.10 but now when I power on the system, Windows Boot Manager boots into Windows (without asking which OS I would like to boot into), One probable reason for the same can be that, windows may have not detected the presence of Ubuntu as the secondary OS. (I've checked the msconfig utility which only lists windows 8.1)\nThis is what I have tried\nI've tried Boot Repair utility which I found mentioned at many places in the Ubuntu Forums as well, But this reported an error (I can mention the error If anyone needs it). I've also turned off \"secure boot\" and \"fast boot\" in windows.\nWeird behaviour\nThe thing I don't understand is, When I power off the system by long pressing the power button and then start it again, GRUB Bootloader magically appears! But, When I Shutdown the system from within Ubuntu or Windows, then Windows Boot Manager boots up directly into Windows...\nAnother weird thing here is, When I plug-in the Linux Live USB and then turn on the system, and keep pressing the F11 key I can load the GRUB Bootloader. But this only happens when the Linux Live USB Key is plugged into a port...\nWhat I ultimately want to achieve\nSo, At the first priority, I would like to have Windows Boot Manager load up at the startup dispalying a list of available OS to boot.\nAnd if that's not possible, then GRUB should load up with the same options i.e. an OS list to choose from...\n\nA: You could try typing the following into a Windows administrator command prompt:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\nThat tells Windows to use Grub as the bootloader.  For me, this prevented the system booting straight into Windows automatically, so I could choose between Windows/Ubuntu.\nWhat is the error that Boot-Repair gives you?  I don't know how to (or if it's even possible to) get the Windows Boot Manager to recognize Ubuntu and give it as an option.\n", "Q: Charms and juju. Why there are no charms under saucy? I've just deployed maas and juju in my saucy installation. And I found there are no charms for saucy. I think I need to include cs:precise for all charms. Why? Saucy is now released.\n\nA: Most charm authors only release charms under the LTS release unless the charm is not functional on the non-LTS releases. If you are having an issue deploying a charm under saucy your best bet is to contact the charm author for an update. Since charms are designed for software deployments in production environments we recommend using an LTS.\nSaucy only has a support life of nine months, while LTS releases will be supported for over 5 years. As such, server deployments (and by association, charms) are targeted at LTS releases of Ubuntu (precise, trusty). Charm authors can choose to provide versions of charms for other Ubuntu releases, but it's not a requirement.\n", "Q: Changing C drive permissions from Ubuntu to Windows? I cannot access the C drive or launch apps that requires admin permission on my Windows 8, because I've changed C drive admin or user permission to full deny.\nI've tried many methods but it didn't work. Can I do it from Ubuntu?\n\nA: \nSo can i do it from ubuntu?\n\nNo. Permissions on Windows are not changeable from Ubuntu. If you have problems accessing a disc from within Windows you will have to fix this from within Windows.\n2 quotes:\n\nWindows now contains some newer components like Junctions, Symbolic Links, and other NTFS system files that can cause major problems if they are mishandled, such as changing the permissions.\n\nand\n\nIf you've tried these suggestions and still can't sign in:\nIf you have Windows 8.1, you'll need to reinstall Windows.\n\nI am glad I am using Linux.\n", "Q: How to monitor website requests from my home network? I have set up a wireless wifi network through my pc, so that My younger brother can use Internet through his laptop. But I want to monitor which sites he is visiting. How can I do that?\n\nA: Well, a solution I know which I implemented once which you can also use is configuration of syslog server.\nI believe your brother and you are both using Ubuntu then you can configure your system as syslog server and his system as syslog client.\nWhich will send his log files to your system so that you can check what he is accessing.\nSee the link below on for more information on rsyslog(syslog) in Ubuntu:\nrsyslog\n", "Q: Linux drivers for Acer Aspire 5000 I have an Acer Aspire 5000 laptop and want to change from XP to Linux. Do I need to backup my drivers before doing so?\n\nA: No,you doesn't need to install drivers for linux.Drivers are needed for graphics,mobile broadband,etc.You can't able to install backedup XP drivers on linux.\n\nA: You don't need to backup drivers of your windows XP system. \nWhen you will install Ubuntu it automatically installs drivers (also Windows drivers are not compatible in Ubuntu).\n\nA: Yes, backup your drivers; and anything else you need. If you need or want to go back to Windows you will need them after installing Windows again. Otherwise you might run into trouble: windows is not very forgiving if you can not install the network card driver and you need to download it but need the network card to work. Better to have your drivers saved on a dvd/cd.\nIf you are asking this expecting those drivers to work in Linux: Linux uses its own generic drivers for almost any hardware so the Windows versions are useless.\nWe have our own display drivers but you can also use the proprietary drivers that are offered to you after installing. These are also Linux versions.\nThe only problem you might face is the wireless driver. Check if it works with the Live DVD by supplying password and username for your network. If it does it will work after installing. If it does not you might need to install an extra driver (by connecting with a wire).\n", "Q: Win8 partitions showing up i Ubuntu I recently installed Ubuntu 13.10 alongside Win8. The different Win8 partitions (the main partition, recovery partition and a couple of others) are showing up in Ubuntu. Now I'm wondering if they're supposed to be showing up in Ubuntu in the first place? If I try to enter (mount?) either of these partitions the following, or similar, message applies:\nError mounting /dev/sda4 at /media/jonas/Acer: Command-line `mount -t \"ntfs\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=0077,fmask=0177\" \"/dev/sda4\" \"/media/jonas/Acer\"' exited with non-zero exit status 14: Windows is hibernated, refused to mount.\nFailed to mount '/dev/sda4': Operation not permitted\nThe NTFS partition is in an unsafe state. Please resume and shutdown\nWindows fully (no hibernation or fast restarting), or mount the volume\nread-only with the 'ro' mount option.\n\nAnything I should worry about?\n\nA: *\n\n*Bootup into windows OS and restart your pc not shutdown.\n\n*Then bootup into ubuntu os now click on that ntfs partition.The ntfs partition will be mounted and you can able to see all the files in that partition.\n\nA: You need to disable the \"Fast Startup\" feature in Windows:\nhttp://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/6320-fast-startup-turn-off-windows-8-a.html\nThis feature is enabled by default, and it turns shutdown operations into suspend-to-disk operations. The result is an inability to mount shared partitions (if you're lucky) or filesystem corruption (if you're unlucky).\n", "Q: BT dongle - ASUS USB-BT400 not working I run on one problem.

I was thinking of installing Ubuntu to replace Windows, but I don't know how to do this. I am going to try installing Ubuntu 12.04.3. Can I do this with a 800 MB disc? Finally, is it possible if Windows is installed, but doesn't work?\n\nA: As long as your BIOS or UEFI is still working (the splash screen with your computer manufacturer's name on it when your computer starts up), then you will be able to install Ubuntu.\nUbuntu 12.04, which is older than the latest version, 13.10, but has a longer support period. The latest version of Ubuntu, 13.10, has a shorter support period , but newer features.\nUbuntu 12.04 will fit on an 800 megabyte CD, but Ubuntu 13.04 will not. So, if you plan on installing Ubuntu 13.04, you'll need to use a DVD or USB.\nIf you would like to create a bootable CD or DVD, follow these instruction to create a bootable CD/DVD from Windows, or these instructions if you are running OS X.\nIf you would like to create a bootable USB drive (may not work on older computers), you should follow this guide for creating a bootable USB on Windows using Pen Drive Linux. Again, if you are running OS X, follow this guide instead.\nIn order to boot from your live CD/DVD or live USB, you'll need to press a key when your computer starts up. Assuming your computer didn't come with Windows 8 (in which case you should follow this answer for disabling Secure Boot), it will probablly be Esc or F2. When your computer starts up, look for some text on the screen that says 'Boot Menu' and a key on your keyboard (usually in the upper right-hand corner).\nThe process varies between computer, but there should be an option to select a CD/DVD drive or a USB storage device. If no USB option shows up (ensure that the USB drive is plugged into your computer before you start it), you'll need to use a CD or DVD instead.\n\nA: Yes, you can make a bootable Ubuntu OS with 800mb disk. It doesn't matter whether your Windows installation works or not, you can replace windows with Ubuntu.\nSee this: How to replace Windows with Ubuntu?\n", "Q: Videos playing in Web brower, play at double speed, how do I stop this?

For now I will go with the FTP solution - it's super fast and works, but the question is still open, what is the best solution?\n\nA: Here's an Apache feature I found recently: the \"userdir\" module.\nIf I'm not mistaken, you can enable it by executing in the terminal:\nsudo a2enmod userdir\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nAfter this, if you create a folder named public_html inside your home folder, that folder will be \"included\" in Apache (your 2nd possible solution).\nThe URL to access the content in that folder from the browser is of the type http://YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS/~YOUR_USERNAME/.\nExample: localhost/~ubuntu/ if your username is ubuntu.\nBy default, only static HTML files can be used, PHP scripts can not be used for security reasons. To enable PHP processing when using userdir:\nEdit /etc/apache2/mods-available/php5.conf and comment out the line php_admin_value engine Off by putting a # before it. See below:\nsudo nano /etc/apache2/mods-available/php5.conf\n\n<IfModule mod_userdir.c>\n  <Directory /home/*/public_html>\n    #php_admin_value engine Off\n  </Directory>\n</IfModule>\n\nReload apache2 using\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload\n\nand test your PHP code in the userdir directory.\nIf you get a permission denied error (or similar) in the browser, make sure that the www-data user (I think that's the correct name) can access that folder and the files inside.\nThat means your home folder must have execute (x) permission for the others (o), and that the public_html folder must have read (r) and write permissions for the others.\nYou should then be able to share the public_html folder with the network without problems.\n", "Q: Can i dualboot UBUNTU 12.04 64 bit along with WINDOWS 7 32 bit? I want to install ubuntu 12.04 64bit along side with windows 7 32 bit. Is it possible?\n\nA: Dual-booting is a very easy process with almost no risk. Here's the safest way you can do it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start up your Ubuntu Live CD, changing your BIOS settings if necessary to boot a CD.\n\n*Choose \"Try Ubuntu Before Installing.\" That way, you can see if everything works.\n\n*If everything does work, double-click \"Install Ubuntu\" on your desktop.\n\n*Go through the settings until you reach \"How would you like to install Ubuntu?\"\n\n*Choose \"Install Alongside Windows 7\" and accept the default configuration.\n\n*Finish going through the configuration, then wait for Ubuntu to install.\n\n\nIt is possible you will be unable to boot into Ubuntu. Here's how you can fix that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start up your Live CD again and choose \"Try Ubuntu Before Installing.\"\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+T in to open Terminal.\n\n*Type sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update.\n\n*Press Enter and let the command run.\n\n*Type sudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &) and press Enter.\n\n*Choose the \"Recommended Repair\"\n\n*Follow the instructions you are given.\n\n*Reboot when done.\n\n\nIt is also possible you will be unable to boot Windows. If that happens, do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Ubuntu.\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+T in to open Terminal.\n\n*Type sudo update-grub and press Enter.\n\n*Enter your password and press Enter.\n\n*Reboot when done.\n\n\nBy now, you should have Ubuntu and Windows 7 in a proper dual boot configuration. Good luck with your install! \n", "Q: Rhythmbox plugin conflict when i enable cover art search plugin and browse cover art plugin a message appears saying conflicting plugins.Is there a way to enable all plugins\n\n\nA: Peeking underneath that dialog you'll notice that you have enabled the coverart-browser plugin.\nFrom my project web-page you'll notice in the README that the plugin coverart-search-providers is also a prerequisite for coverart-browser.\nSo what is coverart-search-providers?\nWell, as my other project web-page also goes onto explain, this plugin is a...\n\nDrop in Rhythmbox replacement for the default CoverArt Search plugin\n  to provide new and updated coverart search providers both local and by\n  internet image hosts\n\nThus, you cannot - by design - have both the default cover art search plugin and the coverart-search-providers plugin enabled.\nHere is a nice screen-shot that shows coverart-search-providers - you'll notice that you have various local search and internet search providers.  \n\nYou are in complete control of how rhythmbox searches for its album art.  The default cover art search plugin does not have this flexibility.\nFor more information about how to use coverart-search-providers to its fullest potential, look at the linked projects wiki page:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/fossfreedom/coverart-browser/wiki/How-to-find-great-coverart\n\nIf you want to continue using the default cover art search plugin, you need to untick the coverart-search-providers plugin.  This will also untick the coverart-browser plugin as well i.e. you cannot (by design) use coverart-browser with the cover art search plugin.\n", "Q: What is the \"Loop\" partition in ubuntu? I'm a new user to Ubuntu, to just installed and used the command sudo fdisk -l.\nI found out that my Windows partition is SDA and my ubuntu is loop.\nWhat is this loop thing?\n\nA: A loop device is a file containing a virtual file system inside another file system.\nThere are two common reasons you may be seeing loop\nReason One\nYou may see loop if you used WUBI.EXE to install Ubuntu within Windows. This creates virtual partitions in a large file within the Windows file system.\nNote that WUBI does not work with computers that came pre-installed with Windows 8 or later.\nReason Two\n(Thanks to @mikewhatever for pointing is out in the comments above)\nThe loop device also shows up when you run Ubuntu from a Live CD/USB. A virtual file system stored in the CD/USB/DVD is mounted as loop.\nReference: Wiki on Loop Device\nHope this helps\n\nA: Also worth noting (adding \"Reason Three\" to @user68186's answer) is that parted shows loop as the \"partition table\" for disks that actually do not have a partition table (whole disk filesystem).\nI ran into this accidentally when I wanted to get an ext4 filesystem on a brand new external NVMe M.2 SSD. Plugged it in to an USB port and used Ubuntu Desktop's Disks tool without getting into the details. Then I was surprised that I had no /dev/sda1 but only /dev/sda to mount. Hope this is not related to the occasional I/O errors I get (probably rather a power issue, using it on a Raspberry Pi 4).\n\nA: ...and an important \"Reason Four\": confusingly, parted also will say Partition Table: loop  if you select a partition within a partition table rather than the root block device, eg. mistakenly calling it with parted /dev/sdX1.\n", "Q: Cannot add any PPA I recently tried to add PPA from this website. \nI did sudo add-apt-repository ppa:canonical-qt5-edgers/qt5-proper from terminal. \nI get an error saying \nCannot add PPA: 'ppa:canonical-qt5-edgers/qt5-proper'.\nPlease check that the PPA name or format is correct.\n\nAs suggested in other similar questions, I don't have any problem with internet connection because apt-get install is working as expected.

I have a 3 bar WiFi signal, so it can't be that.  Also, when the computer ran Windows, it actually got faster internet.  Is there a way to get faster internet?\n\nA: When you say your internet is slow, are you refering to the actual speed you're obtaining from your isp or it just appears to be running slowly? If you run a speedtest from speedtest.net and compare it to what you're paying for from your ISP and it is a major difference, I'd check that your network adapter's are up to date driver-wise.\nIf Chromium is the only browser running slow I would suggest uninstalling it and trying a fresh install. \n", "Q: Change user's name in KDE I want to setup my real name in 'System Settings' - 'Account Details' - 'Password & User Account' but when I click 'Apply' there is a dialog asking me for my password and I type it correctly but then it says there is an error: 'An error occurred and your name has probably not been changed.

I would like to install Ubuntu 12.04 alongside Windows and be able to choose between these two systems each time I start the computer.\nI have downloaded Ubuntu and burned a DVD. When restarting my computer (with this DVD in the drive) the DVD is ignored, i.e. Windows is run as usual. When I press delete while rebooting (still with this DVD in the drive) a BIOS set up menu is shown with plenty of things to enable/unable, add, etc. But I don't really know what to do/choose.\nWhen I exit this menu, again,  the DVD is ignored, i.e. Windows is run as usual.\nBascially: I'm stuck.\nQuestion: Is it worth while trying to install Ubuntu from a USB stick rather from a DVD? I.e. is Ubuntu easier to install from a USB than from a DVD? Or am I likely to run into the same kind of problems?   \nComment:\nThanks Alina and DVJ for your answers. So I guess the answer to my main question is: no, installation form a USB stick is not really easier than from DVD.\nFollowing your advice about the boot priorities, I have now achieved a little improvement: I now get to GNU GRUB where I can choose to 'install Ubuntu'. Unfortunately, after that the screen goes completely grey and nothing happens.\n\nA: A few things. On the splash screen for your bios (very first screen) there may be an option to press a key to enter the boot menu. If there is, ensure to press the respective key to enter your boot menu.\nIf that does not exist you may need to go into the Bios itself (that spot you mentioned that has a bunch of enable/disable options) Somewhere in there there will be a screen that gives you the option of moving drives into order of preferance that it boots from. Ensure CD/DVD drive is a head of your harddrive. Save your settings and restart and it should then give you an option to boot from the DVD.\nAs for the USB, without having a boot menu that you can access from that first splash screen - it may actually be harder to boot from the USB device as not all BIOS support have the option in the device boot list for USB drives.\n\n\nA: When you want to install a new OS from whether a DVD or a USB stick, you need to change the boot order. In the BIOS, go to Boot – there should be a tab or major portion with this title.\nUnder boot you may see the boot order or a submenu to change boot priority. This may differ on different computers. In some computers you can press Enter on the first boot option to choose the preferred one (DVD or USB/external). In some others you need to press F5/F6 to arrange to move the preferred one upwards. Look at the bottom of screen where you can see a manual for keys.\nI’ve seen some computers that you need to set USB boot under the harddisk devices.\nNote: in the case you’re installing via a USB stick, insert the media before entering BIOS.\nDVD or USB? No difference really (on installation). But the USB can save your changes and settings if you use it in live mode and can be faster than DVD. Plus that you can re-use it afterward.\n\nA: Here is what to do. Completely shut down your computer. Turn it back on. While it is booting, look in the lower right and left corner. Go into the BIOS by pressing F12, F11, F10, F9, F8, F7, F6, F5, F4, F3, F2, or F1. They are all at the top of the keyboard. G into the boot settings and set the CD drive to the first priority. Hit F10. Start up as usual. You're done.\n\nA: Both of the ways of installing Ubuntu are same , lyk either you burn DVD or create bootable USB Stick, you have to change BIOS Boot Priority for booting,  and then same simple steps for both . Installing from USB is little more simple because it takes little lesser time to install ..\n\nA: you need to read this: HowToInstallUbuntu and if you create completely new System, you can also read this: HowToPartition \n\nA: there is  another way.  download onto your  windows  hdd and use the  installation setup file from within windows.\n", "Q: QtCreator crashes on registering namespace I just installed Ubuntu 13.10 (Desktop) x64 on my computer and wanted to install Qt5 with QtCreator.

Everything is working except of one thing - Client cannot ping (or connect to) anyone (Server machine or the Internet) until Server computer sends him a ping (ping 192.168.1.2).

Sometimes arp -d 192.168.1.1 works, but usually I can't get rid of that strange MAC address...\nI changed MAC address to one seen on a screen above. It didn't helped - after few restarts, MAC address switched again.\n\nA: I'm not a specialist, but I encountered a similar problem with VMWare. The ARP command on the client showed different MAC addresses, almost at random it would seem.\nI solved it by disabling the VMNet virtual adapters of the VMnet I was using in the host operating system. The \"strange\" MAC addresss was the MAC address of that virtual adapter. I can now make my virtual clients connect immediately to the internet, through my virtual server.\nHope it helps\n", "Q: Where is Startup Disk Creator installed? Using XFCE.\nI installed usb-creator, also called Startup Disk Creator using the Ubuntu software center. Where is this installed? It does not show up anywhere in the menu. In the terminal I've tried different commands like usb-creator-common, usb-creator-kde, etc. Program can not be found.\nI like Linux, but this is one of those things that I think is just really sad in Linux or more specifically Ubuntu. If the software centre does not even tell you what the executable name is and where it's stored, how the hell does it expect the user to locate the application?\nI suppose I could check the various bin-folders, but the executable names are sometimes unclear as to their nature.\n\nA: If you know the name of the package, you can list all of it's files using dpkg -L package:\n$ dpkg -L usb-creator-gtk\n/usr/bin/usb-creator-gtk\n/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/usbcreator/frontends/gtk/__init__.py\n/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/usbcreator/frontends/gtk/frontend.py\n/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/usbcreator/frontends/gtk/unitysupport.py\n/usr/share/applications/usb-creator-gtk.desktop\n/usr/share/doc/usb-creator-gtk/changelog.gz\n/usr/share/doc/usb-creator-gtk/copyright\n/usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/usb-creator-gtk.svg\n/usr/share/man/man8/usb-creator-gtk.8.gz\n/usr/share/usb-creator/usbcreator-gtk.ui\n\nIn this case the binary is called /usr/bin/usb-creator-gtk\n\nA: If you use the (ubuntu supported) Software Center with the (Ubuntu supported) Unity, you will have it in the Dash. One of the good things of Linux is the flexibility; so you are free to use a different desktop environment (like myself). But it is not fair to whine about your freedom... \nYou can list all the file installed by a package using \ndpkg-query -L <package>\n\nAnd doing \n dpkg-query -L <package> | grep bin \n\nhas a very high probability to give you the answer. Happy Linuxing!\nMaybe you have just installed the common package without any graphic front-end; try to install the package that will work in XFCE (I do not know if it's the -gtk one or the -kde one, probably the first with sudo apt-get install usb-creator-gtk)\n\nA: For me, using Gnome, it is located as /usr/bin/usb-creator-gtk.\n\nA: There is not a single place where the files are installed\nTo start Startup Disk Creator press Alt+F2 and execute usb-creator-gtk\nTo know where are the configuration files execute these commands:\nwhereis usb-creator-gtk\n\nalso\ndpkg -L usb-creator-gtk\n\nHope you will get your answer.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu on usb drive (not live simulation) I want to install Ubuntu on my usb disk.

How to uninstall Ubuntu? I got my laptop with Ubuntu however, I have no idea about the password that was set on it. How may I uninstall it?\n\nA: Ubuntu is an Operating System.\nYou can not uninstall it like a normal program.\nYou should install another OS in it.\nWhile you are installing new OS, you will be able to delete the partition where Ubuntu OS installed.\n\nA: Previous question has the solution for your answer, although I can tell you to change the password installed. Hope it would work without any problem. Follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open terminal(Alt+Ctrl+T) and execute:\nsu\n\nIt will login to root without asking to any password. I'm sure that you root user password would not be set if you got a newly installed Ubuntu.\n\n*Now execute following command to re-set your Ubuntu's user password:\npasswd <username>\n\neg: passwd saurav if saurav is the user to which you want to change the password. It will ask to type and re-type a new UNIX password. Just set your new password and exit from root.\n\n*For example I'm pasting the output of my terminal:\nsaurav@saurav-P4I45Gx-PE:~$ su\nsaurav-P4I45Gx-PE# passwd saurav\nEnter new UNIX password: \nRetype new UNIX password: \npasswd: password updated successfully\nsaurav-P4I45Gx-PE# exit\nsaurav@saurav-P4I45Gx-PE:~$ \n\nI would suggest you to use Ubuntu, and don't remove it.

I'm artist, I work a lot with Photoshop, Corel Draw, Illustrator, Final Cut, Sound Studio, DVD Studio. I've never used Ubuntu graphic programs before. \nOn this page I would like to figure out which ingredients would best work for graphic (multimedia) purposes: \nCould you please offer some examples as to how much of a certain element I might need to buy?\nFinally: can you recommend a computer best compatible with Ubuntu? \n\nA: The \"Pay what you think it’s worth\" page is for statistical analysis on what you think is worth most in terms of further Ubuntu development only. It will by no means configure your Ubuntu or even change anything on the applications that are installed for free. The page you see asks for a voluntary donation, not more not less. You still can download Ubuntu for free.\nUbuntu and most of the software included are Free and Open Source Software which means they are really free in terms of monetary costs but also are free in terms of usage.\nRead more on this here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu: Our Philosophy\nAs for applications to process graphics and multimedia the same holds true. The most useful applications will be included for free with every Ubuntu distribution. Below applications - to name only a few - are only a mouse click (and some internet bandwith) away once you had installed Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Gimp  - A powerful graphics processor highly extendable with plugins. Comes close to Photoshop in functionality.\n\n*Inkscape  - full blown vector graphics application similar to Illustrator.\n\n*Blender  - a 3D modeller which can produce professional results.\n\n*ImageMagick  - unbeaten versatile command line tool for almost all graphics file manipulation and conversion.\n\n*Audacity  - a great sound processor.\n\n*OpenShot  - easy to use video editing software but with somewhat limited professional capabilities.\n\n*Cinelerra - not in the official repositories due to stability issues but once running stable it is an ambitious video editor.\n\n*and there are many many more.\n\n\nBut if you are seeking paid software with widespread use by professionals, paid support, paid courses and paid tutorials you may be wrong here. This is where the products on Microsoft and Apple platforms still are better.\nYou also may find it hard to switch to an Ubuntu application after you had learned how to do things with the software you mentioned. This also would be a good reason to stay with the system you already have.\nLast not least we still occasionally have issues with import from or export to proprietary file formats of paid software. This is being resolved step by step but we will never beat the originals.\nSo you should try out these Open Source softwares which often are available on your Windows or MacOS too. If you find them useful, and if you do not miss anything from your proprietary paid software then you are safe to make the switch. But if you expect all softwares to work identical to their paid counterparts you should propably better stay with Windows or MacOS.\nFew professional Windows software may run flawlessly on Ubuntu but this is not the case for most. Software made for Apple computers will not run on Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Can I run StarCraft: Broodwar on Ubuntu? Im currently running Mavericks on my MacBookPro (Late 2008) and want to get a different OS that will run Starcraft 1: Broodwar, WITHOUT using wine.\n\nA: The short answer is:\nNo, not natively.\nThe longer answer is:\nYes you should be able to configure WINE or VMBox to be able to play any game that runs on Windows by emulating windows. You will also need to ensure your graphic drivers are updated to the best available.\nEdit: I didn't read the part about 'not going through WINE'\n", "Q: Intel advanced-N 6235 Saucy not finding any wireless networks / bluetooth devices I searched the Internet for my problem but did not find exactly the problem I’m facing.\nI have an Intel NUC with Ubuntu 13.10 installed.

I would like to buy a new Nexus 4 to flash the Ubuntu phone on it.\nIt's written what firmware (Nexus 4 mako occam) the phone should have, but how to find out if I buy it from the store?\n\nA: As you can replace the Nexus 4 firmware, per the instructions for recovery, this is not really relevant.\nSee: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Install >> Device factory reset\n\nFor the Nexus 4, Android 4.2.2 (JDQ39), 4.3 (JWR66Y), and 4.4 'KitKat' (KRT16S) are available.\nSee: https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images#occam\n", "Q: difference in top command and gnome-system-terminal applet I am running xubuntu 12.04, and i find that TOP command reports 900MB RAM usage where as gnome-system-terminal applet graphically shows only 300MB RAM usage.\nWhy the values are differently reported?What is now the correct thing? and Why TOP reports it that way.\nThanks,\nHarish Pathangay\n\nA: After googling and posting the question in forums, i came to understand that TOP reports total used = buffers+cache area.\ngnome-system-terminal displays only individual process memory comsumption.\nI used the free command to get the individual process memory comsumption.\nAll is fine.

You can select and open files from there. If you type \"i\" (without quotes), it will cycle through various views of the directory, including a simple \"tree\" file browser. Type \":help netrw\" for details.\n\nA: Your friend would have been using a shell script.\n\nMy belief is that all file managers suck. There are no exceptions to this.

You don't need to proceed once formatted. Just go back and then use Disk Management in Windows to use your partition\n", "Q: Updating to 12.10 failure I recently started using Ubuntu regularly, as it ran much more efficiently than Windows 7 which I'd been using before. I'm not the most knowledgeable person when it comes to computers, so I can't go into detail about what went wrong, as I don't fully understand, so let me try to explain step-by-step.\nI had downloaded and installed Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit using the Wubi windows installer, and it ran just fine. I got all my files moved/copied over and 'set up shop' so to speak. After about a week, I tried to upgrade to 12.10, so I let the update go, making sure everything was closed, and checking yes to pretty much every box that came up. After I hit yes to the \"Delete outdated files\" option, or something along those lines, it was almost finished with the process when it asked me if I wanted to restart my system. I did. Then after booting up again, my screen just went black. In the top-left corner there was an underscore like I could type something, but it appeared to be frozen. I would greatly appreciate if someone could find out what went wrong, and hopefully tell me how to fix it.\n\nA: I'm afraid your problem is that you performed an in-place update. This is generally bad practice because so many things can go wrong. The user makes a lot of tweaks to Ubuntu over time (whether intentionally or not), so an in-place upgrade is generally hit or miss. For more information on that, look here.\nI recommend performing a clean install, but with a seperate /home partition. That way, recurring clean installs will not cause you to loose your files. Be sure to back up before the install, so you don't loose anything important. For instructions on how to do that, look here.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Resolved -Dual boot Windows 8 / Ubuntu 12.04 is not working - boot-repair did not help as well since I heard I could have windows 8 and Ubuntu running at the same computer (using the same HD) i was really exited to test, but unfortunately i'm not being luck doing that :(\nMy Computer details:\n\n\n*\n\n*Notebook - Dell Inspiron 15R\n\n*8Gb RAM\n\n*1 TB HD Sata3\n\n*30gb SSD\n\n*Video Card - ATI Radeon HD7700\n\n\nI was running windows 8.1 without any problem, so here what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*I create a partition with 100gb (using windows disk utility)\n\n*I enable legacy boot (disabled uefi and security boot) and changed the dell smart HD control to AHCI \n\n*Started the ubuntu installation using ubuntu 12.04 iso\n\n*I did the default procedure, advanced options -> create 4 partitions (/, /home, /boot, swap)\n\n*When the installation was done I started the live ubuntu 12.04 and I used boot-repair as the tutorial informed to do.\n\n\nThe linux is running perfect but I can't log in windows anymore :(\nI can see on grub2 some options, but when I try to load windows 8 i get:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dell recovery screen (the options simple doesn't help me, it says I need to unlock or get permissions of the installation, but the prompt works fine)\n\n*An screen saying about an unknown issue, some hdx(100,200 blabla bla) \n\n*I tryied boot repair a lot of times and I don't know how I installed a different boot as well that starts grub\n\n*Since the prompt works fine I tried the MBR fix procedure and also the boot recovery procedure using disk utility \n\n*I also tried:\n\n\n\nbootrec fixmbr \nbootrec /fixboot\nbootrec /scanos\nbootrec /rebuildbcd\n\n\nbcdedit /set {default} device partition=c:\nbcdedit /set {default}\nosdevice partition=c:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} device partition=c:\n\nRight now I still can boot windows 8, I know windows 8 is sucks but I really need it since some applications I use only runs on it :(\nAny idea in how to fix that?\nPastebin I have with me:\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/6462192/\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/6465662/\nps.

Here's what you can do:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot up Ubuntu and log in\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+T to start a Terminal emulator (Terminal)\n\n*Type sudo update-grub and press Enter\n\n*Let the command finish running, then shut down (it is important you don't restart)\n\n*Start up your computer again and....voila! You should now have Windows as an option in your boot menu (GRUB2)\n\n\nIn addition, it's probably a good idea to switch back to UEFI mode, since Windows 8 is configured to run in that, so it may not work otherwise. You may not be able to boot Ubuntu, then, but that can be fixed with a simple boot-repair. In general, you can fix being unable to boot Ubuntu with boot-repair and being unable to boot windows with sudo update-grub.\nGood luck with your install!\n\nA: I managed to solve it by my self by restoring the default settings using dell recovery.

I see neither relevant keys in gconf, nor relevant members in MenuItem class (set_right_justified doesn't do the job).\nUpdate\nCode update inspired by the suggestion of Timo (note the shift to Gtk3):\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk\nfrom gi.repository import AppIndicator3 as appindicator\n\na = appindicator.Indicator.new('test_indicator', '/some/ico', appindicator.IndicatorCategory.APPLICATION_STATUS)\na.set_status(appindicator.IndicatorStatus.ACTIVE)\nm = Gtk.Menu()\n\nitem0 = Gtk.MenuItem(\"\\tדוגמה: שורה ראשונה\\n\\tשורה שניה\")\nitem1 = Gtk.MenuItem(\"\\tשורה שלישית\\n\\tשורה רביעית\")\nitem0.set_halign(Gtk.Align.END)\nitem1.set_halign(Gtk.Align.END)\n\n#the rest is the same\n\nThe important adjustment in this version is: addition of leading \\t's for each row - otherwise the text starts out of the menu boundaries.

This can already be done by diff efficiently for text files, but not for large binary files - I would like also efficient \"diffs\" between binary files included in the final patch (which, I gather, is known as Binary delta compression - Wikipedia as subset of Delta encoding - Wikipedia). Or, in other words, do something like described in this \"wishlist\" comment (from CommandLineSyntax - xdelta - Google Project Hosting):\n\nIt would be very nice if xdelta supported multiple files patching. Something like:\nxdelta3 -r /path/folder1 /path/folder2 >allfilesrecursivepatch.xdelta\n\nFor recursive comparing all files on folder1 and folder2 and creating a single patch-file for all of them. And:\nxdelta3 -r -d /path/folder1 <allfilesrecursivepatch.xdelta\n\nFor applying the patch on all files contained on folder1\n\nThis facility does not exist, judging by Issue 21 - xdelta - Recursive directory diff support - Google Project Hosting), although there are ways around: the issue page has several suggestions for script wrappers, but I'd rather keep things self-contained in a single tool. \nMost important for me would be the patching a \"live\" filesystem directory part as shown above, due to my intended use case - described in more detail below, and illustrated with a bash script that uses git.\n\nI'd want to be able to update a static website on a cheapish Linux host/webfarm, which only allows FTP transfer (so no rsync and such) with a rather low transfer speed, and only allows PHP script execution. Typically I'd need to sync from local/client/home to server/webhost, but of course I do not want to upload 200 MB each time I want to update a page :)\nI could use outlandishideas/sync · GitHub to \"Sync directory contents over HTTP using PHP\", but besides only syncing from server to local, also only whole files are send: \"No attempt is made to send diffs; this is not rsync\". Similarly, I could use GNU FTPsync; it could probably handle file creation, modification and deletion, but it has the same problem - only whole files will be sent. \nIn principle, git could be used too - the below script generates directories testdir_old and testdir_new, and shows that git can encode the differences between them (in this case being \"removed 1024; added 1024; modified/added 19; modified inline 1200\", or total 3267 bytes of change) as a \"sneakernet\" git bundle file 4470 bytes in size. But even if I could persuade the host to install git up there, I'd still have to maintain a .git repo up on the webhost for the bundle to apply cleanly - and I definitely do not want to do that, as I couldn't spare the extra file size usage; also, it seems that managing large binary files with git - Stack Overflow requires git annex or git bup.. And putting around a script like below would be problematic because git would recreate new revision hashes each time, making the bundle not apply cleanly. \nAlso, since in PHP, I can apparently \"untar-gz without exec()? - Stack Overflow\", maybe it's worth trying to determine changes in directory, then pack only the changed files in a tar.gz, and send that to PHP script on the server, that would unpack it over the target directory. This would still send entire files, but at least they'd be compressed - but deletions on server would be difficult to handle. \nFinally, the binary file diff utilities suggest that one could pack the directories in a .tar(.gz) each, and then run the utility on those files - e.g. (via ExternalCompression - xdelta - Google Project Hosting):\ngzip release-1.tar\ngzip release-2.tar\nxdelta3 -e -s release-1.tar.gz release-2.tar.gz delta-1-2.xd3\nxdelta3 -d -s release-1.tar.gz delta-1-2.xd3 release-2.tar.gz\n\n... probably also doable with JojoDiff / jdiff\njdiff archive0000.tar archive0001.tar archive0001.jdf\njptch archive0000.tar archive0001.jdf archive0001b.tar\n\n... or with bsdiff. However, that requires me to also maintain a tar archive of the entire site on the webhost, to allow the patches to apply cleanly to it, and the space is issue here again. It would also force me to ask the webhost to allow me the install and use of at least the patching parts of the tools; and that may be worth a try again, if those tools wouldn't also require me to keep an additional tar'd copy of the site on the host. \nAnyways, below is the script that demonstrates extraction of a git .bundle as a recursive diff between two directories (or rather, two versions of the same directory); relevant terminal output is included in the comments:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n## comments with double ##; (relevant) terminal output with single #\n## uses git, ImageMagick, tree\n\nset -x\n\ncd /tmp\nrm -rf testdir export_compare\nmkdir testdir\ncd testdir\ngit init\n  # Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/testdir/.git/\n\ngit config user.name \"test\"\ngit config user.email \"test@test.com\"\n\n## generate files - revision 1\n## - text\ncat /dev/urandom | tr -dc '[ -~]' | fold -w 80 -s | head -c 1024 > test_01.txt\nmkdir subdir\ncat /dev/urandom | tr -dc '[ -~]' | fold -w 80 -s | head -c 1024 > subdir/subtest_01.txt\ncat /dev/urandom | tr -dc '[ -~]' | fold -w 80 -s | head -c 1024 > subdir/subtest_02.txt\n## - binary\nconvert -depth 8 -size 200x150 xc:blue rgb:subdir/rgbimage.dat\n\n## check:\n## - files:\ntree -s --dirsfirst .\n  # .\n  # ├── [       4096]  subdir\n  # │   ├── [      90000]  rgbimage.dat\n  # │   ├── [       1024]  subtest_01.txt\n  # │   └── [       1024]  subtest_02.txt\n  # └── [       1024]  test_01.txt\n  #\n  # 1 directory, 4 files\n## - view image (press \"q\" to quit)\ndisplay -depth 8 -size 200x150 rgb:subdir/rgbimage.dat\n\ngit add *\ngit commit -m \"initial commit\"\n\n## check usage\ndu -ba --max-depth=1 .\n  # 1024    ./test_01.txt\n  # 96144   ./subdir\n  # 99947   ./.git\n  # 201211  .\n\n## change files - revision 2\n\n## remove file:\nREP=\"removed 1024;\"\ngit rm subdir/subtest_02.txt\n\n## add file\nREP=\"$REP added 1024;\"\ncat /dev/urandom | tr -dc '[ -~]' | fold -w 80 -s | head -c 1024 > test_02.txt\ngit add test_02.txt\n\n## change files:\n## - text:\nREP=\"$REP modified/added 19;\"\necho \"a new changed line\" >> test_01.txt\n## - binary\nREP=\"$REP modified inline 1200\"\nconvert -depth 8 -size 1x200 xc:red rgb:/dev/stdout | dd of=subdir/rgbimage.dat bs=1 seek=$((200*50*3)) count=$((200*3)) conv=notrunc\nconvert -depth 8 -size 1x200 xc:red rgb:/dev/stdout | dd of=subdir/rgbimage.dat bs=1 seek=$((200*100*3)) count=$((200*3)) conv=notrunc\n\n## check:\n## - files:\ntree -s --dirsfirst .\n  # .\n  # ├── [       4096]  subdir\n  # │   ├── [      90000]  rgbimage.dat\n  # │   └── [       1024]  subtest_01.txt\n  # ├── [       1043]  test_01.txt\n  # └── [       1024]  test_02.txt\n  #\n  # 1 directory, 4 files\n## - view image (press \"q\" to quit)\ndisplay -depth 8 -size 200x150 rgb:subdir/rgbimage.dat\n\ngit add *\ngit commit -m \"second commit with changes\"\n  # [master 2b243fb] second commit with changes\n  #  4 files changed, 16 insertions(+), 19 deletions(-) ...\n\n## check usage\ndu -ba --max-depth=1 .\n  # 1043    ./test_01.txt\n  # 1024    ./test_02.txt\n  # 95120   ./subdir\n  # 123355  ./.git\n  # 224638  .\n\n## go back to parent dir (/tmp) and make a new directory for \"clean\" exports:\ncd /tmp\nmkdir export_compare\nmkdir export_compare/testdir_new\nmkdir export_compare/testdir_old\n## from git, export each revision \"cleanly\"\ncd testdir\ngit archive HEAD   | tar -x -C /tmp/export_compare/testdir_new\ngit archive HEAD^1 | tar -x -C /tmp/export_compare/testdir_old\n## create git bundle, containing the changes between new and old revision\ngit bundle create ../commits_testdir.bundle HEAD HEAD^1\n  # ...

If I get you correctly, you want to update web pages and don't expect most of them changing, in which case I would just upload the changed files, whole.\nThis could be achieved eg. in mc, connect one panel over FTP to your web host, let other panel show the local version. Then select everything and copy, and choose to overwrite only all newer files (you can chose that for all files at once). Or use another file manager's synchronize facility, I believe krusader has some. Unless you've got big files which change only locally (what are they? databases1? executables maybe, but not compressed?), binary deltas won't give you much IMO.\nNOTE 1: Synchronizing databases in this way is a bad idea.\n\nA: give git-ftp a try. it was made entirely for that purpose.\n\nIt keeps track of the uploaded files by storing the commit id in a log file on the server. It uses Git to determine which local files have changed.\n\n\nA: I would use something like curlftpfs to mount the servers FTP share to the local machine and then execute rsync locally on those two folders.\nThis would have the advantage that you don't need to keep the servers state as a copy on the local machine - as it would be necessary if you want to create binary diffs first to send them to the server and then start patching there.\nIf you still would like to go for the diff/patch solution, you could try to use xargs to create multiple patch-files (with xdelta3 or whatever tool you like), tar and gzip them into one big blob, transfer that to the server and there \"reverse\" the whole process.\nYou still would need to find out first, which files need patching at all, so  the process would probably look like this:\n\n*\n\n*use cmp to check whether the files differ at all\n\n*create the binary diff and put it into a file in a temporary folder. Choose name and subfolder there so the original filename and location to be patched can be derived on the server.\n\n*do the last two steps for all files in the folder structure you need to update (with xargs or params of find)\n\n*make a patches.tar.gz of that temp folder, upload it to the server, trigger the patching there\n\n*develop a custom solution for new files or files to be deleted. Those could be handled directly via ftp as no patching is necessary.\n\nBut be aware, if you implement that patching stuff, you are developing a product that you have to maintain, that's no easy \"just configure it\" solution anymore.\n", "Q: Kernel.org kernel config options different from Ubuntu ones After compiling Ubuntu kernels for a few days (quite a fun experience, I must say), I decided to finally plunge into some vanilla kernel goodness. \nSo far, so good.

For one, there is no option to add an arbitrary version string. \nIs there any way I can enable all the options the Ubuntu config had to over? \n\nA: If you want all of the options that the Ubuntu patched kernel sources offer, then you need to apply all of the patches that Ubuntu applies to the kernel.

In general, it is almost impossible to find a generic way of doing it; every application can store data where it wants. \nNevertheless, most applications stores settings in directories of files \"hidden\" in your home directory, of the style ~/.config/application-name/ or  ~/.application-name. \nYou can start by searching where they can be with \nfind ~ -iname \"*application-name*\"\n\nand researching from here. (Basically, the above command list all files of directories under your home directory that contains the string \"application-name\", in a case-insensitive way). It will be a trial and error thing.\nAfter you have found all the directories/files containing options for the application, you can delete them (if you are sure that they are for the application alone --- a backup before deleting things is a good thing to do). \nEven so, application can leave traces and configuration files in a lot of places.

This causes my battery to run out quickly. \nI have tried the 'brightness and lock' in Ubuntu, but of no use.\nIs there any software which really makes a change in brightness?\n\nA: if i understand your post correctly this is because the brightness hotkeys do not work? if so try changing:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\nto this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor\"\nin the file /etc/default/grub, then:\nsudo -i\nupdate-grub\nafter this hotkeys should be functional\n\nA: In Dell studio the current brightness level is stored as a text in the following file /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness.\nOne way to reduce brightness is to open that file as superuser and change the brightness level. The level has some maximum value above which an increase in the level will not affect the brightness of the screen. \nEdit the value in the above file using the command line editor - nano.\n run the following command in the terminal \nsudo nano /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\nput in a password and then replace the value in the file with a lower value.\npress 'Ctrl+x' to exit and 'Y' when prompted to save changes. the hit Enter and then boom.... good-luck\n\nA: I too faced this problem with my ASUS laptop until I found this.There is a simple command to fix this brightness problem.Open the terminal and type in it this command:\nsudo setpci -s 00:02.0 F4.B=1f\n\nand enter your password if it asks for.\nNow note the last thing in here \"1f\",it gives the brightness on a hexadecimal scale (00-ff) \nwhere 00 is the least brightness and ff is the maximum brightness.\nHope it helps.\n\nA: This may well have something to do with your graphics card. Do you have NVIDIA? \nI've had the same problem; it was due to the Nouveau graphics card driver that Ubuntu installs as a default. \nOpen 'Software & Updates' and go to the tab 'Additional drivers'. It will tell you which graphics card driver it is using. Switch to NVIDIA's recommended proprietary driver. Reboot, and adjusting brightness should now work.\nBe alerted: the new driver will mess up your nice splash screen in the beginning, but apart from that, everything will run fine.\n", "Q: The ifconfig command is not running I am using Kali Linux through vmware .

The tutorial (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Beginners/BashScripting) states that -f is force, and the computer will not ask permission to delete a file.\nTo test this I created a locked file but -r and -rf achieve the same results of NOT deleting the file (Permission denied).\nWhy is this?\n\nA: In Ubuntu the rm command behaves as expected in removing files we own without prompting when running with option -f.\nExample for a write-protected file:\n:~/Test$ rm test.txt\nrm: remove write-protected regular empty file ‘test.txt’? n\n:~/Test$ rm -f test.txt\n:~/Test$\n\nRoot will be able to remove all files irrespect of permissions. This is why we may not see a difference from option -f when running sudo rm.\n\nWe should be aware that the behaviour of Unix commands may be different on a different OS.\n\nPlease also take care to double check your command when running rm recusively (-r). This command when accidentally issued on the wrong path will irreversibly purge all files there. This may be dangerous to your system health, even more so when run without prompting for errors (-f).\n\nA: Here is an explanation of what both options do.\n-f  Remove all files (whether write-protected or not) in a directory without prompting the user. In a write-protected directory, however, files are never removed (whatever their permissions are), but no messages are displayed. If the removal of a write-protected directory is attempted, this option will not suppress an error message.\n-r  Recursively remove directories and subdirectories in the argument list. The directory will be emptied of files and removed. The user is normally prompted for removal of any write-protected files which the directory contains. The write-protected files are removed without prompting, however, if the -f option is used, or if the standard input is not a terminal and the -i option is not used. Symbolic links that are encountered with this option will not be traversed. If the removal of a non-empty, write-protected directory is attempted, the utility will always fail (even if the -f option is used), resulting in an error message.About rm\nSee also Commands Reference\n\nA: Let's make it clear:\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*rm -rf directory means force (do not ask questions, just do it) the recursive removal of directory.\n\n*rm -r directory means attempt to remove recursive the directory.\n\n\nThis is what man rm says:\n\n-f, --force\n       ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt\n[...]\n-r, -R, --recursive\n       remove directories and their contents recursively\n\n\nAnother good information from the manual page:\n\n[...] if  a file is unwritable, standard input is a terminal, and\nthe  -f  or   --force   option   is   not   given,   or   the   -i   or\n--interactive=always  option  is given, rm prompts the user for whether\nto remove the file.  If the response is not affirmative,  the  file  is\nskipped.\n\nOf course if you don't have permission to remove/delete a file, you will get rm: cannot remove ‘file_name’: Permission denied error. -f option doesn't stay for to remove files where you don't have permission in any case!\n\nA: Sounds like you don't have the privileges to delete this file, maybe the Administrator account isn't root.

OK testdisk doesn't seem to offer much.\n\nA: First: If you have important data on this disk this would be a good time (actually a bad time) to make a backup. See Data-Recovery: Imaging a damaged device, filesystem or drive. \nMaybe your Harddisk is dying.\nSecond: Look at this: How can I fix mounting my data drive after a crash?\nThird: Check your Harddrive using Smartmontools and eventually badblocks: sudo badblocks -vsn /dev/sda (This may take some time, don't do this if you have an ssd)\n\nA: Finally found this link where file system type ext4 gets a bashing but after giving all the tips I'd already tried, it finally says do this:\n\nsudo mkfs.ext4 -S /dev/sda1\n\nThis will replace all your superblocks with correct data, assuming the blocksize is guessed correctly (the default is correct for most systems.) If you need to use this, please read the man page on -S first. Don't blame me! \n\nbut only if you feel lucky. \nIt fixed the partition so I could read it again. However, I had to run fsck to fix the errors that were still there, and that dumped the content of /etc and a lot of other stuff into /lost+found so I'm going to have to do a re-install and restore from back-up to get it going again.\n", "Q: Tool to disable services and daemons For the old (and still used in debian) init mechanism there are tools such as rcconf to disable services and daemons.\nAre there such for whatever is used in Ubuntu (upstart I guess) ?\nI am running 12.04.3.

I want to dual boot Black Box 3 along with Ubuntu 12.04.\nHow do I go about achieving the same?\n\nA: Firstly, Back Box is a linux distribution, you will not actually be installing it \"in\" Ubuntu but rather it would be installed as a dual boot O/S.\nThis http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2180011 shows how to do similarly with Scientific Linux and Ubuntu 12.04LTS.  The principles will be the same.  You will need to make space for the new distribution, install it and update your Grub to \"see\" Back Box.  And, better yet, here is a mini-how-to on the Back Box forums.\nAnother possibility is to install the tools that exist in Back Box on to your Ubuntu installation.  This will save you from installing another O/S just to get forensic tools,  for example, which may be in Ubuntu's repository now.\nThere are many links about how to install multiple boot setups using different distributions of Linux.\n", "Q: 12.04 installing lexmark s605 on network I haven't used unix for twenty years, heaven help us I was a unix box product manager once.

Can this be achieved?\n\nA: You could use read (see man page of your shell) to make the terminal wait for the user to press a key to indicate they have read the output. Unfortunately, read from dash is rather limited, so I'd recommend using bash for this.\nread -s -n1 -p \"Press any key to continue\" will print the prompt to the terminal (-p), wait for any key to be pressed (-n1) and finally exit without printing the entered key (-s).\nAdding that to your script gives your users all the time they need.\nUpdate: To integrate the above into nautilus-actions, create a bash script you can then use as action in the configuration dialog.\nThe script would have to look something like the following.\n#!/bin/bash\ngksu chmod +x $1\nread -s -n1 -p \"Press any key to continue\"\n\nCalling that script with a file name as first parameter – just like you did before with chmod – will set the executable bit for that file, then wait for user input.\n", "Q: How to share ubuntu laptop ethernet to android 4.2.2 via usb?

Have tried Ubuntu 13.10, the last LTS and also Kubuntu 13.10 but none will run a display properly. Even when booting from a live USB/DVD I get a corrupted display. Clean installs do not help. \nIn particular, Ubuntu displays strange behaviour. The launch bar, the dash, and the shutdown options (accessed when pressing the computers power button) all display properly, but everything else is a mash of crazy colours. \nScreenshot:\n\nAny info gratefully appreciated. Hopefully it is hardware that will be supported soon. \n\nA: Have found out that the display that I was confronted with is typical of any situation where trying to use cross-fire'd AMD cards. \nIt is necessary to download the propriety drivers from AMD whilst you don't have the crossfire setup, or if you do have the crossfire setup in place, you'll have to drop to tty and wget the drivers. \nEven once you start the installation procedure from tty following the graphical interface failing to load, following the recommended steps will not work. Instead of installing via the recommended route (generating a system specific installation package) choose the option for xorg install. \nAlso, having a different AMD card in place and installing the drivers, then switching to your crossfire setup (swapping the cards) doesn't work either - you'll have to drop to tty, clean out the drivers, reinstall xorg, reboot, and then install proprietary drivers afresh!\n\nA: If you like to work with commandlines you could switch to an other tty with\nctrl+alt+F1\nthen follow the steps on this answer:\nAMD Driver update (one from amd.com)\nIt describes fresh installation of graphic drivers from AMD.\nYour card should be supported.\nTo switch back to graphical terminal use:\nctrl+alt+F7\nLatest AMD drivers can be found here\nhttp://support.amd.com/en-us/download\n", "Q: Thumbnails in nautilus in Ubuntu 13.10 After upgrading to 13.10, nautilus stopped producing and showing thumbnail icons for images and videos.\nAlso in KDE environment, there's no longer a standard icon for nautilus in start menu (or its submenus).\nHow should I solve these problems with nautilus.\nEdit:\n\n‌\n‌Before upgrading both could have proper thumbnails.\n\nA: For the first one, you just may need to edit the settings:\n\n\nIf that fails, you may need to install the programs to thumbnail the files:\napt-get install....\n\nProbably atleast one of these - at a guess (EDIT: this was for Ubuntu 13.04/10 - you can search here for thumbnailer packages - e.g. for 16.10):\ngnome-sushi - file previewer \nlibnautilus-extension1a - libraries for nautilus components - runtime version\nnautilus-actions - nautilus extension to configure programs to launch\nlibthumbnailer-dev - development files for thumbnailer\nlibthumbnailer0 - generate thumbnails from files\ngnome-exe-thumbnailer - Wine .exe and other executable thumbnailer for Gnome\ngnome-raw-thumbnailer - RAW file thumbnailer for GNOME \nooo-thumbnailer - thumbnailer for OpenOffice.org documents\nkde-thumbnailer-deb - KDE plugin to show thumbnails of Debian package files\nkdegraphics-strigi-plugins - transitional package for kdegraphics-related plugins\nkdegraphics-thumbnailers - graphics file format thumbnailers for KDE SC\nffmpegthumbnailer - fast and lightweight video thumbnailer\nffmpegthumbnailer-dbg - debugging informations for ffmpegthumbnailer\nffmpegthumbs - video thumbnail generator using ffmpeg\n\n\nFor your second problem, remove this line from /usr/share/applications/nautilus.desktop (The launcher file for Nautilus - EDIT: For newer versions of Ubuntu use org.gnome.Nautilus.desktop instead of nautilus.desktop)  :\nOnlyShowIn=GNOME;Unity;\n\nYou can edit it using nano for the entire system:\nsudo nano /usr/share/applications/nautilus.desktop\n\nor preferably for the current user:\ncp /usr/share/applications/nautilus.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/\nnano /usr/share/applications/nautilus.desktop\n\n", "Q: Drivers for TP-LINK TL-WN725N Nano USB Wireless N adapter Can you advise me on what drivers to install for the TP-LINK TL-WN725N USB wireless adapter on UBUNTU 12.04.

I'm trying to boot an older Dell 32-bit Intel machine from an ubuntu ISO dvd. The curve ball is that I don't have another PC to make the DVD on, so I'm using my Mac (running OSX 10.6 Snow Leopard).\nI downloaded the proper ISO file to my Mac (32-bit, ubuntu-12.04.3-server-i386.iso) and checked the md5 hash with the published one on ubuntu.com. All good.\nUsing precisely the instructions here: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/burn-a-dvd-on-mac-osx I burned the .iso file onto a DVD. The disk verifies fine. \nOne odd thing to note: If I try to \"Open\" the downloaded .iso volume with the Mac disk utility, it says, \"No mountable file systems.\" Likewise, if I try to mount the newly burned DVD, it won't work for the same reason. However, I can \"Convert\" the iso file using the Disk Utility, which blows it out into a directory with files you'd expect to see on a boot disk. More on this Converted directory later.\nI take the newly burned and verified ISO DVD to the PC and try to boot from it. The DVD reader, BTW, is the topmost device in the boot list.\nThe reader spends a while reading the DVD (the light comes on and it spins up) but then the BIOS simply prints out: \"Missing Operating System\".\nNow, to eliminate the possibility of a bad DVD reader, we took an old (2002) Red Hat Linux boot CD we had and tried that. It was recognized immediately and the Linux install program started up. However, that doesn't appear to be an ISO image, because if I put that in my Mac, it mounts immediately and I see the boot files, etc. And yes, the drive in the PC is a DVD reader, not a CD reader.\nSo, I thought perhaps the aged PC's BIOS might not like ISO files, so I took the \"Converted\" directory files (recall those from above?) and burned them to a DVD and tried to boot from that. Still the same \"Missing Operating System\" message.\n\nA: If all else fails you could purchase an install disk from the canonical store: here\n", "Q: No WiFi in Xubuntu 12.04 I recently installed Xubuntu 12.04 on my Toshiba Satellite.

Why is this?\n\nA: Have you rebooted your Toshiba any time recently?  I had a similar issue with my ASUS netbook and realized that it only happened after it had been on for a long time.

So if we send hibernate code every shutdown or reboot, can we block usb boot hacks?\n\nA: Are you trying to prevent someone from accessing your HDD by booting up a system from USB? If an attacker have physical access to your machine, he can always take out your HDD and do what he want. So in this case it won't help if you could disable booting from USB. This \"hibernating method\" is no more safer then password protecting your BIOS. \nDrive encryption is the only way to prevent an attacker with physical access to your machine from accessing your files.\nI see you want an answer from credible/official source, so for example look at this. It also says that the resolution is to encrypt your files/drive.\n\nA: A simple attack vector on the protection scheme you proposed is to let the computer wake up from hibernation and then forcefully restart it. Upon next boot it will boot normally, allowing access to the BIOS settings key and USB booting.\nHowever, in order to give a more precise answer you'll need to provide additional details. The kind of functionality you're describing is probably implemented by your computer's UEFI firmware (and not BIOS which isn't sophisticated enough). So the answer might depend on the exact UEFI firmware you have (as different vendors might implement different protections there).\n", "Q: Audio is out of sync with Avconv I'm broadcasting to Justin TV with this script found on Github on Ubuntu 12.04.\nI am having issues with the audio going out of sync and getting worse as I go through my playlist.\nThis is the code I'm using for avconv.

Consequently, i opted to get rid Ubuntu in order to downgrade or find a lighter version of linux altogether and i did this, perhaps mistakenly, by deleting the paritition using XP. Now when i turn on my pc i am greeted with a black screen and a message that says partition missing...After another intense googling session it seems that many solutions begin with the verification of its filesystem name using \"f disk -1\".

I booted from a USB and used GParted to shrink the Ubuntu partition leaving me with about 100G of free space.  I want to use this to increase the OS X partition space.  GParted will not let me increase the OS X partition size (although it will let me decrease it).  I've also tried using Disk Utility from OS X.\nWhen I had the 100G of unallocated space, Disk Utility would report \"MediaKit reports partition (map) too small.\"  I also tried creating a new partition of both \"unformatted\" and \"cleared.\"  Now when I use Disk Utility, it says \"Preparing to resize,\" but doesn't move on.  It doesn't lock up, but even after half an hour it is still \"preparing to resize.\"\nGParted still can't increase the OS X partition size either (same as before). I also can't create an hfs+ partition with the unallocated space.  The option is there, but it is grayed out.\nI've seen this question, but the solutions all involve booting the OS X CD, which I do not have.  Using df does not list the OS X partition either, but Ubuntu does not appear to have gpt anyway.\nIn general, I've read that I need to repair the partition table, but the only ways from OS X that I've found to do this require having a CD to boot from.\nI've also read that since I used GParted to create the free space, I need to use GParted to resize the partition or at least put it in a resizable state, but nothing I've done will allow me to resize the OS X partition.\n\nA: If the diagnosis that there's a problem with the partition table is accurate, I recommend you install the gdisk package in Ubuntu (or download and install the Mac version from Sourceforge), launch it on your disk, and use the v option to check for errors. If you find any, check the gdisk documentation on repairing the disk or report back here with details. (Edit your original question and post the gdisk output there.)\nIt's also possible that you're running into problems related to a hybrid MBR. If so, it's possible that converting the hybrid MBR into a conventional protective MBR will fix the problem; however, this might render Linux (and Windows, if it's also installed) unbootable. There are ways to correct this -- you can either regenerate a hybrid MBR after you resize your partitions or convert Linux to boot in EFI mode.\n\nEDIT: I have a new thought on this issue, which is that you may not have sufficient space between your partitions. OS X's Disk Utility likes to see at least 128MiB of space between existing partitions. If that space isn't present, it will often refuse to work on the disk, although I don't recall the error message it gives. Since you haven't posted your partition table details, it's hard to know if this is a plausible explanation for your problem -- you presumably have ~100GiB of free space somewhere, but it might not be in the right location to please Disk Utility. If this explanation is correct, you may need to resize one or more Linux partitions to ensure that there's free space after every OS X partition. Posting the output of sudo parted /dev/sda unit s print (typed in an Ubuntu Terminal window) will show us how your disk is laid out, which should be helpful in determining if this hypothesis has any merit.\n", "Q: Installing skype on 64-bit breaks on dpkg --add-architecture i386 It is supposed to be easy process:\nsudo dpkg --add-architecture i386\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://archive.canonical.com/ $(lsb_release -sc) partner\"\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install skype\n\nBut on the first line dpkg --add-architecture i386 I get an error\ndpkg: error: unknown option --add-architecture\n\nType dpkg --help for help about installing and deinstalling packages [*];\nUse `dselect' or `aptitude' for user-friendly package management;\nType dpkg -Dhelp for a list of dpkg debug flag values;\nType dpkg --force-help for a list of forcing options;\nType dpkg-deb --help for help about manipulating *.deb files;\n\nOptions marked [*] produce a lot of output - pipe it through `less' or `more' !\n\nHow to solve this so that I can finally install Skype?\nEDIT\nIn synaptic I get error The following packages have unmet dependencies:skype: Depends: skype-bin but it is a virtual package\nIf I try to install skype-bin, I get error: \nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:  skype-bin:i386 : Depends: libqt4-dbus:i386 (>= 4:4.5.3) but it is not going to be installed\n                  Depends: libqt4-network:i386 (>= 4:4.8.0) but it is not going to be installed\n                  Depends: libqt4-xml:i386 (>= 4:4.5.3) but it is not going to be installed\n                  Depends: libqtcore4:i386 (>= 4:4.7.0~beta1) but it is not going to be installed\n                  Depends: libqtgui4:i386 (>= 4:4.8.0) but it is not going to be installed\n                  Depends: libqtwebkit4:i386 (>= 2.2~2011week36) but it is not going to be installed\n                  Recommends: sni-qt:i386 but it is not going to be installed\n                  Recommends: libasound2-plugins:i386 but it is not going to be installed E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.\n\n\nA: If you get stuck try changing server to \"Main server\" instead of your country's servers.

Normally there isn't need to install other drivers (or modules) after installation (unless some really corner cases, I never installed another drivers).\n\"gallium 0.4 on amd cedar\" is a code name for the mesa driver. Mesa is the library that allows software to use OpenGL and HWA capabilities of the graphics cards. Most likely your real driver is called radeon.

I am using opendjdk7 and the icedtea web browser plugin via the software center and I am not using the java provided by oracle.  Do you need the actual java?  If not you could remove it and use openjdk or just the openjre if you do not need the development stuff.\nAs for Ubuntu and java, Oracle changed the licensing and java cannot be provided.  It is not free software.  You can read the licensing to understand it better.  So, as such, Ubuntu cannot provide it through its own sources (that is why you had to set up a ppa to get it).\nAs for the errors you are getting, they could be coming from the website's interaction with your browser.  I know we have software at work that is crazy finicky with java versions.\nIf you do not need the actual java, give openjre/jdk a try and the icedtea plugin.\n", "Q: installing ubuntu on 2 drives if I have a 32 gb ssd and a 1tb hdd can I put /usr and /home on the 1tb and root on the ssd, or is the 32 gb ssd still not big enough for the os?

In the following step you'r able to make partitions and set mount-points for them, also if they are on different drives. \n(To make /home and /usr on the 1tb drive, make two partitions there and give them the mount points /home and /usr, make another on the ssd and give it the mountpoint /). \nAlthough 32gb should be more than enough for ubuntu.

As a student, I get Microsoft Office 2010 for free from my university's website. I know there are programs that let you run things like that in Linux, but I've never used them before so I have no idea where to start. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: The easiest way to install Microsoft Office is by using Play On Linux. Go to software center and type playonlinux, it's important to type it without spaces. Install it. Open it, it will ask to install some aditionall packages, install them. Then, click on install(+ icon). In search, enter Office, or something similar, click on version of office that you want, and click install. Follow very simple instructions. Play on Linux will configure everything else for you. I use Microsoft office 2010 on ubuntu 13.10, and it works without problems, and this is the easiest way to install it, since you don't have to configure wine.    \n\nA: Few different options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Dual-boot.  Boot to Windows when you want to run Windows apps.  This offers the best compatibility and assurance that it will work as intended.\n\n*Run Windows applications inside Wine, a thin software layer that emulates the Windows API allowing many Windows apps to run somewhat natively on Linux.  Some apps are more compatible than others, with some refusing to start, but the Wine devs focus pretty heavily on Microsoft Office compatibility.  This is also the only method where you don't legally require a Microsoft Windows license (though obviously, do you need a license to run the software, which may impose extra requirements or restrictions).  Installing Windows applications in Wine is often as simple as having Wine installed, and running the installer (eg setup.exe) with Wine.  But for individual applications you should consult the WineHQ database for custom setup instructions tailored to particular software.  That database may also warn your of compatibility glitches with certain software, and there will most likely be glitches.\n\n*Run Windows inside a Virtual Machine on Linux (such as VirtualBox).  This is the method I would least recommend, because it will be slow and consume huge amounts of memory, and won't integrate at all well with your external OS - the simple act of transferring files from the outer Linux OS into and out of the virtual machine will itself be difficult.  The only benefit to it is that you can run an actual copy of Windows simultaneously to your Linux OS.\n", "Q: Installing Google Earth in a 64-bit system ok. solved the problem with lib-core now I get this error.\njacob@jacob-desktop:~$ sudo -s dpkg -i google-earth-stable_current_amd64.deb\nSelecting previously unselected package google-earth-stable.\n(Reading database ... 173493 files and directories currently installed.)\nUnpacking google-earth-stable (from google-earth-stable_current_amd64.deb) ...\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of google-earth-stable:\n google-earth-stable depends on ia32-libs; however:\n  Package ia32-libs is not installed.\n\ndpkg: error processing google-earth-stable (--install):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nProcessing triggers for man-db ...\nProcessing triggers for gnome-menus ...\nProcessing triggers for desktop-file-utils ...\nProcessing triggers for bamfdaemon ...\nRebuilding /usr/share/applications/bamf-2.index...\nProcessing triggers for mime-support ...\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n google-earth-stable\n\nwhen I try to install ia32-libs ubuntu tells me it has been replaced with other packages. advice??\n\nA: Just install the 32-bits version.

And in other commands it is used to reference a filename. (not a directory).\n\nA: The meaning of the flag will vary from command to command.  Often, it means 'force' or 'filename'.  In the example you specified, it is used to force resetting of an entire directory.\nYou can look up command-line options for many programs from their manpages, like so:\nman dconf\n\n\nA: -f can mean whatever an app has specified.

I made the disk with pendrivelinux (per instructions on the Ubuntu website). \nIt all completed successfully, I checked the md5sum of the .iso file and it was correct. \nWhen I restarted my computer and booted off the flash drive, I ran \"Check disk for defects\" and it ran properly, but returned that my disk had 2 defects. However, it wouldn't tell me what the defects were. It seemed to be checking files on the USB device itself.\nBut from Googling the problem some people say it checks the USB and others say it's checking the computer's HDD.

I'm writing this on the Ubuntu desktop (without install)  and it seems to be working fine.\nHow can I solve this ?\n\nA: It checks the install disks for defects i.e. the liveUSB.  \nIf the md5sum checked out good(you might want to retry), then the ISO should be good.  If you are finding defects in the install disk after 2 builds, the it is possible that the pendrivelinux did not download correctly, you might try downloading that again.  \nLastly, no I would not install it from a faulty disk...it could be athat it is a minor problem and you might be missing some inconsequential program like a game but it could also be system critical, like the bootloader.\nIf all else fails you might try to download the ISO again, but I don't understand why it would have a good checksum if it was faulty.\n\nI'm not an expert by any means so you may get an answer that it is ok to install from the LiveUSB but, I personally would not do it without expert advise to the contrary....(and if I'm incorrect someone will let us know in short order..)\n\nA: Pendrivelinux actually change two files to make the live USB drive boot correctly. The live USB drive has in fact been made successfully, and will work seamlessly both for trying ubuntu and for installation.\n\nA: I just had the same error trying to make a bootable Ubuntu 14.10 USB stick with Pendrivelinux under Windows 7.

I am pretty new to Linux. \nI always see two terms hardware driver and kernel driver. \nSo what are the differences between the hardware driver and the kernel driver?\n\nA: \nSo what are the differences between the hardware driver and the kernel driver?\n\nThere is none. Provided context, \"driver\" is most used in the Windows environment, in Linux/Ubuntu world these are commonly known as \"modules\".\nBut, there is a differentiation between drivers that runs in Kernel mode and drivers that runs in User mode.\n\nA: Most likely you have come up with the hardware drive that is a kernel module rather than a user-space module. It is not an alternative, but rather an orthogonal classification.\nSo you can have (these are examples):\n                  Kernel                 |  User space\nHardware      | Most harddrive drivers   |  3G Internet modem driver\nNon-hardware  | EXT3/4 driver            |  Some non-standard filesystem\n\nIf you were building your own kernel, you would actually have to decide whether to include some driver in the kernel space.

Have set various delays. Quotation from http://www.draisberghof.de/usb_modeswitch/#trouble:\n\nAnnother way of influencing the kernel behaviour is the parameter\n  \"delay_use\" of  \"usb-storage\" which sets the time in seconds after\n  plugging when the storage device   will actually be used (and probably\n  automounted). The default value is 5; this might  affect the switching\n  result under certain conditions. To change the default add in\n  /etc/modprobe.conf:\noptions usb-storage delay_use=1 (or 10, or other)\n\nWith delay of 1-3, works sometimes. Sometimes doesn't.\nUPDATE 2. After days of testing, I have an impression that it is not any particular delay setting which makes usb_modeswitch work, but changing this setting. Also I have a (very tentative) feeling that logging in/out and changing autologin settings somehow interferes with modeswitching.\n\nA: Can you please try this:\nDownload the package modemmanager0.5.1.97-0ubuntu1 from here or from here.\nOpen Synaptic Package Manager type in your password when required, search for the package named modemmanager when you find it, hit the right click on it and hit on Mark for complete removal and close the Synaptic Package Manager.\nLook for the file you downloaded before and execute it (it will may be open on the Ubuntu Software Center), install it and close the Ubuntu Software Center.\nNow open one more time the Synaptic Package Manager and search for the package named modemmanager again, when you find it click on it and go to the upper menu option Package, hit on Lock Version until you see a checkmark next to that option and a locker next to the package name.\nRestart your system and let us now if that worked.\n\nA: install dongle drivers manually.If the dongle is mounted as a storgae device then you can check whether the dongle contains the drivers itself. otherwise download it and install by just running the script.\nThen in terminal type\ncd /etc\nvim modules\n\nthis will open up modules file with vim editor. add this lines in the end of the file.\nusbserial vendor=0x12d1 product=0x1c0b\n\nwhere 12d1 and 1c0b are the vendor id and product ids gained from lsusb command. logout and log in.connect usb dongle.\nrefer this link\n", "Q: How can i know whether the LUKS is using passphrase or key file for authentication purpose? Lets an example, i have a Linux partition /dev/sda6 and already encryption been enabled with DM-crypt (cryptsetup) tool.\nAs i know dm-crypt can have two way of authentication like with key file or passphrase which we can specify at the time of enabling of encryption. But is there any way so that i can identify the encryption enabled happened with key file or passphrase from its LUKS header or any other possible option?\n\nA: LUKS doesn't really make any difference between keys and passphrases; so a passphrase is a key you type in, if you like. Just by looking at the LUKS metadata, it's not possible to tell whether a key or passphrase was used. However, if there is an unencrypted /boot and Initramfs, you can usually tell from the scripts present there, whether it would be asking the user for a passphrase or look for a keyfile somewhere. In particular, you may want to check /etc/crypttab as that's the most common configuration file for determining which method is used to decrypt something at boot time. If your root partition is part of the encryption, the only way to get at that file is again to unpack the Initramfs of the system's kernel using cpio.\n", "Q: How to play music, coming from the microphone jack? I have a USB device attached, which enumerates as a microphone. It streams some music, and I can easily record it with e.g. Audacity. \nHowever, I want not to record it, but jsut listen on my headphones.\nI have ALSA and Pulse Audio installed as usual. What is the best way to route the audio to my wishes? \n\nA: I've picked this up some time ago. I hope it still works.\nHow to load a loopback device in PulseAudio\nOpen a terminal with Ctrl + Alt + T. Then enter\npactl load-module module-loopback\n\n(without sudo or any special root rights). Now you should hear what is coming from your AUX-in. If not then open your audio settings dialog and try to change your settings from there. You will find the additional loopback-device.\nIf this works good and you want to have it on each boot, do this\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"load-module module-loopback\" >> /etc/pulse/default.pa'\n\nIf for some reason you want to mute the device\npactl set-source-mute 1 1\n\nTo un-mute it \npactl set-source-mute 1 0\n\nI've used this guide.\nRelated\n\n\n*\n\n*Question: Pulseaudio loopback unload audio output devices\n\nA: First, open a terminal. You want to use module-loopback to send input from a source right back to a sink. @MadMike's answer is alright if you just have one sink and one source, but you'll most likely have more.\nFirst, find the source you want to use, type pactl list sources to get a list of your sources. Then, find the sink you want to loop back the same way, using pactl list sinks. Remember the names, on a default setup (using module-udev-detect) these will look like alsa_input.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo\nNext, you want to actually load module-loopback. This works the way @MadMike explained it, just be sure to include the sink and source names like this:\nload-module module-loopback sink=alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo source=alsa_input.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo\n\nIf you put this into your system-wide configuration (default.pa), put it at the end and wrap it into .fail and .nofail, so Pulse will still start even when the device is unplugged.\n.nofail\nload-module module-loopback sink=alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo source=alsa_input.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo\n.fail\n\nWhen replugging the device, you'll also need to restart pulseaudio with pulseaudio -K (breaks active streams, restarts pulse immediately when autospawn is on)\n", "Q: How to display resource usage gadget on my Unity desctop? I am confused.\nSo, Unity is a set of tools, put on top of Gnome 2, and giving it a new look and feel? And Gnome 3 is something different.\nAll I manage to do is create quick-launch favourites, as well as desktop shortcuts. However, the great customazability of Gnome 2 Classic is gone to me.\nHow do I get something, similar to this (the two graphical indicators in the top bar)?\n\n\nA: Unity no longer uses the old applet system. Instead, there are indicators. \nOne such indicator is indicator-multiload, which shows CPU and memory usage. It is included in Ubuntu's repositories and can be installed using your package manager of choice.\nOn a general note: Unity is not based on Gnome 2, it just uses GTK2-based programs like Gnome 2 did.\n", "Q: What do + and - mean in the output of jobs command? I cannot find the answer anywhere. When i have several jobs that are in the background and i list them with jobs i get the following:\n[1]   Stopped                 command1\n[2]   Stopped                 command2\n[3]-  Stopped                 command3\n[4]+  Stopped                 command4\n\nThe plus sign is always on the last one, and the minus is on the second to last. What do these things mean?\n\nA: They'll always be the latest and latest-minus-one running jobs.\nTheir only purpose, as far as I can tell, is to provide a shorthand for those two latest jobs so you can reference them as fg - instead of fg %3.

Once launched it (1) sets focus to the game window and (2) sends the keystroke commands through Xdotool.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# set focus to epiphany\nxdotool search --onlyvisible --class epiphany windowactivate\nsleep 0.5\n\n# move down one unit\nxdotool keydown --delay 100 Down Arrow; xdotool keyup --delay 12 Down Arrow\n\n# move down one unit\nxdotool keydown --delay 100 Down Arrow; xdotool keyup --delay 12 Down Arrow\n\n# move down one unit\nxdotool keydown --delay 100 Down Arrow; xdotool keyup --delay 12 Down Arrow\n\n# move right one unit\nxdotool keydown --delay 100 Right Arrow; xdotool keyup --delay 12 Right Arrow\n\nBut, this solution doesn't work consistently.\nSometimes the character only completes part of the move - e. g. only 2x \"Down Arrow\". At other times he moves too slow and is crushed by the diamond.\nAre there any suggestions on how to solve this - preferrably using Xdotool?\n\nEdit:\nThe straightforward commands like xdotool key Down Arrow - as suggested - don't work.  The character in the game doesn't move at all.\n\nA: Reducing your delays seems like the obvious answer. The default is 12ms and you've boosted that to 100ms for your arrow presses, without explaining why.\nAnd instead of using keydown then keyup and having to worry about delays and all that jazz, just use key. This allows you to just chain keys together, like a boss:\nxdotool key Down Down Down Right\n\nIf you find that's too quick, reintroduce your --delay but start from 12 and work up until it works.\n", "Q: Unable to lower screen brightness 13.10 I had this issue since i installed ubuntu 13.04 long ago, and i have tried missing around with the gedit files but no joy.\nGraphics card: intel integrated graphics 3000HD\n\nA: Open a terminal and type sudo gedit /etc/default/grub\nModify the line: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_backlight=vendor\"\nThen run sudo update-grub and reboot.\nIf it doesn't work try changing the same line to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=Linux acpi_backlight=vendor\" and run sudo update-grub again.\nThis works for some backlight problems.\n", "Q: How can I install a USB bluetooth dongle in Ubuntu 12.04?

I upgraded to Ubuntu 13.10 \"Saucy Salamander\". After upgrading, whenever I open the Unity Dash to search for an application, it takes at least a minute before it starts to show some result. The new scopes addition has made Dash painfully slow. Is it possible to speed up the Dash's response time?\nI have already turned off the \"include online search results\" option.\nI can live without internet information on Dash, but cannot stand a slow application menu (which is supposed to be its primary feature)\n\nA: You can disable individual scopes in the Dash Plugins section of Applications Lens. Ubuntu 13.10 brought the Smart Scopes feature with lots of feature packed scopes. This may make Unity slow and resource hungry. But it brought a good thing too: you can now selectively disable individual Scopes from the Dash itself.\n\n\nPreviously, scopes could be disabled only by unchecking the corresponding schema entries using dconf or gsettings. This is not needed now as it can be done from Dash itself. As a more aggressive measure, you can uninstall the unwanted Scopes and Lens. These are packages named like unity-scope- or unity-lens-. For example, I usually remove unity-scope-musicstores and **unity-scope-video-remote* scopes and unity-lens-music and unity-lens-video. You may remove scopes and lens which use online search or the ones you don't need.\nAs suggested by Sushantp606 in this Answer you may disable Online Searches in Unity Dash. To do so, goto System Settings ▸ Privacy ▸ Search Results ▸ When searching in the Dash: Include online search results and turn it off.\n\nTurning off Record Activity will affect all searches, both online and offline. Don't turn it off, unless you don't mind Dash not displaying recently used Apps, Files, Music, etc.\nIf you're experiencing slowness during the first search on Dash after startup, it's the startup delay of Dash. It'll speed up after a while. The second or subsequent searches will be fast. You may use preload or similar daemons to decrease startup delay.\nDisabling Blur or changing to Static Blur can increase Dash performance,but won't do anything in particular to increase Search efficiency. For suggestions to improve Unity Dash performance on the whole,and not just with respect to Online Searches refer to How to speed up the Dash response? and How can I speed up the dash?\n\nA: Install compiz settings manager :\nBy running the following in the terminal.\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nNow open compiz settings manager and then goto the unity plug-in.\nNow disable blur in dash this will increase the speed of your dash significantly.\n\nA: open up synaptic and remove the various useless unity-scope-***** and unity-lens-***** applications.\n\nA: the only way I know is go to System setting - privacy -off include online search, and off record activity, that’s it.\nAnd check this once that might be a hardware issue.\n\nA: I'm not sure if this works in 13.10, but when I want to search for applications in 14.10, I've gotten in to the habit of using Super+A (for the Application Lens) and not just Super, which searches all Lenses. At least for me, the difference in speed is quite dramatic, even with all the unnecessary lenses already disabled, as suggesting in the accepted answer.\n", "Q: Advice on building my first pc with ubuntu I have just started to receive the pieces of my computer, I am planning on using just Ubuntu on this computer.

With this you can look at xmodmap -pke | lessand see what this keycode is bound to. In my system I have keycode 123 = XF86AudioRaiseVolume NoSymbol XF86AudioRaiseVolume for the volume up key.

I bought SSD disk too and installed Windows 8.1 64bit on it. Now I want to install Ubuntu 12.04.3 64bit on the HDD disk, but it seems to be impossible. I turned off fast startup and secure boot, but the problem still exists. I tried  booting from LiveCD and pendrive. Result is always the same. Ubuntu installer dosn't start. Could anybody help me to solve the problem?\n\nA: It sounds like you're having video problems with GRUB in EFI mode. The simplest solution is likely to be to perform a BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode installation of Linux and then switch the boot mode by installing the EFI-mode boot loader of your choice.\nInstalling Linux in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode is fairly straightforward: Use the firmware setup utility to enable BIOS/CSM/legacy support (the exact wording and location of the option varies from one EFI to another), boot the installer in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, and install normally. (For simplicity with the next step, do not create a separate /boot partition.) The result will probably be that you'll be able to boot Linux but not Windows; but if you disable BIOS/CSM/legacy support you'll be able to boot Windows but not Linux. A caveat: Some computers have quirky EFIs that can cause additional problems. These are too numerous to enumerate, but they're individually rare, and most are easy to overcome. Thus, if you have problems, post back with details.\nIf you get to this point, I recommend you prepare a USB flash drive or CD-R with my rEFInd boot manager. (That page has download links for both types of media.) You can then set your firmware to boot in EFI mode and boot from the rEFInd medium. This should enable you to boot either Linux or Windows. If that works, you can then install whatever Linux EFI-mode boot loader (ideally with boot manager features) you like. If rEFInd worked for you, it should be a safe and easy choice: Just ensure that your EFI System Partition (ESP) is mounted at /boot/efi and install the Debian-package version. GRUB 2 or Fedora's patched GRUB Legacy should work with few problems, too, although if my initial diagnosis is correct, there's a chance that GRUB 2 will produce a corrupted display.\n", "Q: How to tell if an app is going to get suspended from QML I'm developing a game for Ubuntu Touch that needs to go in a \"pause\" state when the user goes away from the app to another. How do I get this.\nI tried to see if the visibility of the MainView changes, but it doesn't. Couldn't find it in the cookbook nor in the API.\n\nA: There an application property in the qt imported namespace which has a state that can be bound to:\nConnections {\n    target: Qt.application\n    onStateChanged:\n        if(Qt.application.state !== Qt.ApplicationActive) {\n            // Pauze the game here\n        }\n}\n\nThe documentation here says the following:\napplication.state\n\nQt.ApplicationActive - The application is the top-most and focused application, and the user is able to interact with the application.\n\nBut this is also issued with swiping from the top or left.\nOn the desktop, this is also issued when you re-size the window, which I'd consider a bug.\n\nThere is also:\n\nQt.ApplicationSuspended - The application is suspended and not visible to the user. On mobile platforms, the application typically enters this state when the user returns to the home screen or switches to another application. While in this state, the application should ensure that the user perceives it as always alive and does not lose his progress, saving any persistent data. The application should cease all activities and be prepared for code execution to stop. While suspended, the application can be killed at any time without further warnings (for example when low memory forces the OS to purge suspended applications).\n\nBut this doesn't seem to work. I've reported a bug report. Please mark if it also affects you.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 installer (alongside windows 8) and gpt partition I found several answers regarding that issue but I'd still like to get some confirmation on how to behave in this situation. I bought a quite recent laptop with a pre-installed Windows 8 on a 128Gb SSD primary hard-drive . As I use it as a working gear, I need to install Ubuntu on it. While launching the Ubuntu installer from a USB flash drive (after deactivating the quick start, the graphic acceleration etc. in the Bios) a finally get there but another problem showed up as Ubuntu installer does not detect my windows 8 partition. The \"other option\" can be selected but I'd rather not as I do not want to break my windows 8 partition (and I saw several posts on forums where the grub-repair or boot-repair or magic-boot-repair) failed. It clearly seems related to the GPT partition aspect.\nBecause of the GPT partition on my primary hard drive (where windows 8 is installed), Ubuntu installer fails to detect Windows 8. The only solution I found for now appears to be the removal of the GPT partition (using fixparts or gdisk). My problem is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*If I do delete the GPT partition, will my windows 8 partition remain intact and be able to boot (since apparently the different BIOS can or cannot handle disk with or without GPT partition)\n\n*I want to install Ubuntu on my other hard drive (which is a 1Tb classic hard drive) and let the primary hard drive only for windows 8 (which is a 128Gb SSD hard drive) so do I need to do so or should I just install Ubuntu by making my own partitions manually and then restore grub (using boot-repair for example) to go back to the classical dual-boot menu?\nA long story short, the option I'd like to take is the \"Install Ubuntu alongside windows 8\" and no more questions asked and get everything working/launching without restoring or modifying the MBR or moving it to another hard-drive to preserve my neat and working windows partition but I am not sure this is actually possible.\nSorry for the long post and thank you in advance.\n\nA: There's no such thing as a \"GPT partition\" in quite the sense that you seem to be suggesting. The GUID Partition Table (GPT) is a partition table -- that is, it's a data structure that defines partitions. The entire disk must be either GPT or something else, such as the older Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table. Thus, deleting the GPT data would delete all the partitions on the disk, which you probably don't want to do.\nThat said, some disks are actually MBR disks but they have leftover GPT data from an earlier partitioning of the disk. This situation can cause parted, GParted, the Ubuntu installer, and some other tools to mistakenly believe that the disk is empty. The FixParts program that you mentioned can detect and correct this problem. I don't believe this is your problem, though; computers that ship with Windows 8 almost always use GPT, so unless you re-installed Windows using MBR, your disk should legitimately be GPT. You can test this by running FixParts on the disk; if it terminates with a message to the effect that the disk is a GPT disk, then that's what it is.\nI haven't researched the issue in detail, but the Ubuntu installer seems to have a bug that causes it to not provide the \"install alongside\" option for many computers that ship with Windows 8 pre-installed. I suspect that this is the issue you're seeing. Unfortunately, the only solution I know of is to use the \"something else\" option. Note that you'll almost certainly need to correctly identify your EFI System Partition (ESP) to the installer. It's a FAT32 partition, typically 100-1000MB in size, and you tell the installer to use it as an \"EFI boot partition.\" (Why the developers chose too change \"system\" to \"boot\" is beyond me. Such changes just create confusion; but I digress....)\n\nA: I've had this issue as well and after experimenting for a while, in found out that it's not windows 8 causing the problem at all. I set up a dual boot with windows 7 and ubuntu 13.10 too and I faced the same problem.\nThe solution is very simple if you know what's causing it. The reason that ubuntu does not detect your windows installation is because you have a new laptop, newer systems usually use a UEFI, it looks like ubuntu isn't really optimised for this. In your bios settings, you have to search for an option to set it from UEFI to Legacy. After doing that you should be able to install ubuntu alongside windows 8 without a problem.\n\nA: I had the same issue. I installed Windows 8 on a GPT formatted disk and when I tried to install Ubuntu 13.10 it didn't even recognize Windows existed. You must format your disk to the mbr format to have Ubuntu recognize windows. This is because the GPT partition format does not gel with Ubuntu that well though you can install it. Here's what I did that worked:\nNOTE: Back up all necessary files. You are about to lose EVERYTHING. You are about to do a fresh install of BOTH Windows 8 and whichever Ubuntu version.\n1) Have a bootable Windows 8 on a CD, USB or whatever\n2) Turn on the machine and press F2 or whichever button brings up your UEFI menu (some \n   of us refer to this as the BIOS menu)\n3) Under the boot tab change the setting from \"UEFI\" to \"Legacy Support\"\n4) Save and exit then bring up your boot device selection menu by pressing F10, F11 or \n   F12 (whichever your laptop brand requires)\n5) Select the device with Windows 8 from the menu\n6) You will be given two options. A big button for installing Windows 8 and a smaller, \n   underlined string to the bottom left to repair your PC.\n7) Press Shift+F10 to bring up command prompt\n8) Type \"diskpart\" to be brought to the DISKPART command section\n9) Type \"list disk\" to show your disks and relevant info\n10) Type \"select disk #\" to select the disk you want to convert. For example, mine was \n    disk 0 so I typed \"select disk 0\". It's always the one with the biggest space\n11) After being informed that the disk is now selected type \"clean\". This may or may not\n    take a while\n12) After being informed that the operation was successful type \"convert mbr\".\n13) After a successful confirmation message, close the command prompt and proceed to\n    install Windows 8\n14) You may then install Ubuntu after restart. \nNOTE: DON NOT USE WUBI TO INSTALL UBUNTU ALONGSIDE WINDOWS 8\nInstead of selecting \"Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8\" I recommend selecting the \n\"Something Else\" option and adjusting your partitions yourself. \n", "Q: How can I restore the Time and Date to the panel?

After a problem upgrading to 13.10 we had to create a partition which appears as device labelled 115 GB volume. when opened in the files window it's name in the tab is  a lot of numbers and letters.\nI would like to delete the partition safely. Is there anything I should check first and how do I delete it?\n\nA: *\n\n*Should you do anything first to make sure it's safe to delete? Yeah. You need to make sure that there is no important data on it that you need. If, after deleting the partition, your computer does not boot, you can use boot-repair to repair GRUB 2.\n\n*How should you delete it? You install GParted using the software center. Run GParted, authenticate, right click the partition and Unmount it, if necessary, delete it, resize any partitions you want to resize to give them more space, and hit the green check button to apply the operations.\n\n\nBut I can't stress this enough: Make sure your data is backed up and there is nothing you don't want deleted on that partition!\n\nA: first, install gparted; open a terminal and type\nsudo apt-get install gparted\nopen gparted\n...It should be simple then. You just select the partition, right click, delete\nbut watch it!!! you should know that after you do that you'll have the 115 GB unallocated! that means that they're not part of any partition and you can't normally use them. Consider them as floating in the air or something and I really don't think you want that, do you? After deleting the partition you should then stick the unallocated space to another partition. That depends on how your hard disk looks like. You can take a screenshot of gparted and put it here to let us see your hard disk. You can also just follow the documentation here http://gparted.org/display-doc.php?name=moving-space-between-partitions .\n...Just a friendly hint. If you don't really need to delete the partition and you can use it as it is then it's better not to play around with partitioning much because you might loose your data.\n", "Q: How can I have transmission start automatically when I open my computer?

Using Acronis I cloned the Ubuntu installation over to my new laptop... accidentally overriding the Windows installation. \nNo big deal, I thought. It was a new computer and I didn't have anything special on it so I popped a Windows 8 disc in the drive, and loaded onto my second partition.\nNow, the computer only boots to Windows 8 and I have no idea how to get it boot to Ubuntu.\nI have already turned off the UEFI and Secure Boot options from the BIOS but I have no idea where to go from here.\n\nA: *\n\n*Try boot-repair,it would be the best option for repairing your grub.For this,you have to boot ubuntu-live disk or usb,and select try ubuntu.\n\n*A desktop like screen appears,press ctrl+alt+t,it would open up a terminal.Then run the below commands to install bootrepair,\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\n\n\n*After running the above commands,a boot-repair window will appears.Select Recommended Repair option.After successfull completion,restart your pc.Now it works.\n\nA: Avinash Raj's solution will probably work; however, a solution that's simpler (on the system level, maybe not for you as a user) is to type the following command in a Windows Administrator Command Prompt window:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\nThis tells the firmware to boot GRUB rather than the Windows boot loader by default. This solution assumes, though, that Ubuntu was booting successfully before you installed Windows. If Ubuntu wasn't booting, it could be there's something wrong with the current GRUB configuration, in which case running Boot Repair or installing some other EFI boot loader may be necessary. Also, you may need to type sudo update-grub in a Terminal window once you've booted Ubuntu in order to add Windows to the GRUB menu.\nAlso, many EFIs provide their own boot managers. They're usually accessed by pressing Esc or a function key early in the boot process. If you're lucky, you'll find that both Windows and Ubuntu/GRUB are available options. You may even be able to adjust which one is the default in the firmware, although many EFIs lack that functionality. At the very least, though, this might be useful for a one-off Linux boot, whereupon you could use efibootmgr to fix the problem.\n", "Q: Boot-Repair Error Hi I have a boot report here. I need to know what settings to turn on. Default repair does not work, there is a /boot partition under sda7, but turning on that setting alone, makes it so the grub shell comes up. I need the boot menu. I have a tri-boot laptop, Opensuse, Win7, and Fedora 19. \n\nA: I do not see Ubuntu anywhere? This is a site on Ubuntu issues. They may shut this thread down.\nYou have grub legacy (??) in the MBR. You need grub2 for whichever install you want to boot primarily in the MBR. Unselect auto repair in Boot-Repair and select update MBR and choose which install to install to sda's MBR.\nYou also show a grub2 in the extended partition  (PBR) with the boot flag. You may have been able to boot to the grub2 install in a PBR with a Windows boot loader. But grub does not use boot flag. Windows does need a boot flag to directly boot from MBR or make repairs to a partition. Do not think Windows 7 will boot from sda1 which is now FAT16? Not sure how you changed that as Windows 7 boot files are normally in a NTFS partition. But you also show boot files in sda2 so that should work if BCD is correct.\nYou will need to add lvm2 drivers and mount the Fedora install to get grub2's os-prober to find the Fedora install. Or manually copy boot files into 40_custom. Best to install Fedora directly into an ext4 partition when multi-booting as the advantage of LVM of resizing partitions works better when the LVM is an entire drive.\n", "Q: Ping IP or URL from different IP with same Ubuntu how to ping a IP or URL from different location or IP with same Ubuntu  PC .\nI want  access same IP or URL from the same Ubuntu PC but not with same system IP every time .\nthank you. \n\nA: If you control multiple machines (and have SSH access to them) you could use something like dsh to control them all at once, and by doing that, run something like:\ndsh -M -c -a -- 'ping <<target_host>>'\n\nObviously that's going to require key-based access to all the hosts and you'll need to spend some time setting up dsh (here's a tutorial).\n\nThe easier solution is to use an external tool like one of the many ping services...

It sounds like your local apt cache is dated.\n\nA: There could be two possible causes, given the information given. You are trying to install packages that are not on the repository (because they were deleted, moved, upgraded, or the specific version of Ubuntu isn't available anymore) or you haven't updated the package list in a while.\nThe first can be a temporal issue (try again later) or a permanent one.

You can't see them unless you do what MadMike said, unhide them via Ctrl+H. \nThis is done because these folders often hold lots of configuration files and stuff the non-regular user wouldn't need to mess with, so they are hidden to make a cleaner view.\nSo, the folder is actually there. As for getting read/write access, just enter the commands sudo chmod +rwx [FILES]. It will give you read, write, and execute permissions on those files. However, be careful, as messing around with sudo and chmod/chown can really mess up your system in case you allow yourself to do something dangerous you otherwise wouldn't have been able to.\n", "Q: Is there any groups for software development in ubuntu?

The bash shell doesn't only look at /usr/bin but a entire set of directories:\necho $PATH\n/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/home/braiam/.rvm/bin\n\nYour command either should be on one of the directories, or have a function/alias that calls it. For those cases you might prefer type:\n$ type ls\nls is aliased to `ls --color=auto'\n$ type jobs\njobs is a shell builtin\n$ type apt-get\napt-get is /usr/bin/apt-get\n\n\nA: There are more directories than just /usr/bin getting searched for commands to run. The full list is saved in the $PATH variable. To see its contents, run echo $PATH.\nYour script (or a symlink to it) should be in one of those directories.\nUPDATE: Unfortunately, the $PATH variable can be set in any file sourced by the shell. Good places to start looking would be /etc/environment, /etc/profile, /etc/bashrc, ~/.bashrc and ~/.bash_profile. Also, some people recommend setting $PATH in /etc/X11/xsession.d/90environment, so checking there might help, too.\n", "Q: Different types of file systems for the booting partition When setting a partition to be bootable (i.e. setting the bootable flag = on), is it necessary to set it's file system as:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reserved bios boot area\n\n\nor\n\n\n*\n\n*EFI boot partition\n\n\n?\nThe problem I'm facing is that I've installed Ubuntu Server 12.04 numerous times and each time after the installation complete, I reboot and the server reports that there are no boot devices are available.\nThe server has 2 boot menus (i.e. moods ?) which are:\n\n\n*\n\n*BIOS\n\n*UEFI\n\n\nI'm not sure whether to boot from the USB in UEFI or BIOS mood ? Will that effect the type of file system I should choose for the bootable partition ?\nBasically, why doesn't the OS load after it's installed ?!\n\nA: First, be aware that there are two partition table types: the older Master Boot Record (MBR) system and the newer GUID Partition Table (GPT). Windows ties these partition table types to the boot method: MBR works only with the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) and GPT works only with the newer Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) or Unified EFI (UEFI). Linux is more flexible, but deviating from this mapping can cause problems, as noted later.\nThis is important because the \"boot flags\" that parted, GParted, and other libparted-based tools present have different meanings depending on the partition table type. Specifically, the \"boot flag\" is properly named for MBR disks. It's used by some (but not all) BIOS-mode boot loaders to identify the partition that holds second-stage boot code. EFI boots in a completely different way, though, and for reasons that I don't pretend to know, but libparted developers chose to re-use the name \"boot flag\" on GPT disks to identify the EFI System Partition (ESP) -- that is, it's a partition type code on GPT. The concept is only very loosely similar to the MBR concept. As a practical matter, it's common to set the \"boot flag\" on a Linux partition on MBR disks, although this isn't required when using GRUB (because GRUB ignores the \"boot flag\"). On a GPT disk, though, you should never set the \"boot flag\" on a Linux partition; it should be set only on the ESP. Linux doesn't care about this, but the firmware might, and other partitioning tools or OSes might get confused if a Linux partition is set as the ESP. For clarity of discussion, the term \"boot flag\" is best reserved for MBR disks, because the term is not used on GPT disks outside of libparted-based tools -- the GPT fdisk family (gdisk, sgdisk, and cgdisk) doesn't use it, and neither do tools outside of Linux. In fact, there is a \"legacy BIOS boootable\" attribute in GPT that's closer to the meaning of the MBR \"boot flag,\" but it's set in libparted via the \"legacy_boot flag.\" I'm sorry that this is so confusing. You can blame the libparted developers for hacking something together with inadequate thought.\nMoving on, you've asked about two partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*The ESP holds a FAT (officially FAT32, although FAT16 often works) filesystem and EFI boot loaders. It is, as I said, identified by a \"boot flag\" in libparted, or by a type code of EF00 in GPT fdisk. There's no officially-mandated size, but it's commonly between 100MiB and 1GiB. It's required to boot a computer in EFI mode.\n\n*The BIOS Boot Partition holds GRUB boot code for booting from a GPT disk in BIOS mode. It's not required when booting in EFI mode. This partition is typically 1-2MiB in size, although it can sometimes be smaller. Making it larger will serve no real purpose. It does not hold a filesystem; GRUB just dumps code into this area \"raw.\"\n\n\nIt's possible for a GPT disk to have both an ESP and a BIOS Boot Partition; however, you need at most one of them to boot. (In fact, you can boot using SYSLINUX, LILO, or GRUB Legacy in BIOS mode with neither of these partitions.) Having both will enable you to switch between BIOS-mode and EFI-mode boots, assuming you've got both types of boot loader installed.\nAs to your problem of your firmware saying that there's no bootable device, I recommend you read the following pages:\n\n\n*\n\n*My page on EFI-mode Linux installations. This page is distribution-neutral. It provides background on EFI and tips on working around EFI-related problems.\n\n*The Ubuntu UEFI wiki. This is the \"official\" Ubuntu wiki entry on EFI-mode booting.\n\n\nThe \"no bootable device\" error typically means that one of three things is happening:\n\n\n*\n\n*The computer is configured to boot only in EFI mode, and it can find no EFI-mode boot loader -- say, because you installed Ubuntu in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode or because the ESP is mis-identified.\n\n*The computer is configured to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, but there's no BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode boot loader available -- say, because you installed Ubuntu in EFI mode.\n\n*The computer is configured to boot in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, but the firmware expects to see a \"boot flag\" on an MBR partition. If you installed Ubuntu in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode but used GPT partitioning, no such flag will be present. This causes some EFIs to flake out. See my page on the topic for details.\n\n", "Q: Where can I find ibus \"Keyboard Input Methods\"? Earlier I used to activate Bangla (Unijoy) layout from ibus preference. Accessed ibus Keyboard Input Methods, ibus preference would only show up a handful of chinese scripts. I had to install \"ibus-m17n\" to get the whole package which included the unijoy layout.\n\nHowever, starting 13.10, I can't find the ibus preference/Keyboard Input Method screen at all. It's been replaced by text entry field, where there are Bengali layouts but not Unijoy. Terminal shows that ibus is installed but I can't bring up the front-end. I even installed ibus-m17n but still the unijoy layout doesn't show up.\n\nI know it wouldn't matter for a lot of people here since it's just a local language, but I need it.

It did.\nIn the end I had these files in if-up.d: bind9, ntpdate, openntpd, openssh-server, postfix, and upstart.\nNote: I did not have any \"up\" scripts in my /etc/network/interfaces file, so that's why I started looking at these directories.\n\nA: I had this problem on Ubuntu 12.04 after \"open-iscsi\" package installation.\n   That package was needed and i couldn't just delete it )).\nProblem was in scripts\n/etc/network/if-up.d/open-iscsi\n/etc/network/if-down.d/open-iscsi\n\nIf VM has several network interfaces, then several instances of open-iscsi init script executed on system boot.

That is, I'd type in the name of an application, and for some reason online suggestions would appear first; not until after several seconds have passed do I get the obvious suggestion: the app itself.\nFollowing @WarrenHill's very good answer here, I'm able to disable the online scope and see that it shouldn't really take this long for application-suggestions to come up. Hence, this isn't some FIFO architecture (which I'd be fine with; as long as there aren't any local results, I don't mind seeing online suggestions); having the online scopes enabled actually slows down getting the result I want.\nHowever, that doesn't mean I'd never like to get online suggestions. In fact, I kind of like them; they're just much less useful to my everyday work than local results. So, my question is:\n\nIs there any way of specifying run-order for scopes? Can I stop Dash from seeking online suggestions until after all local results were gathered?\n\n\nA: have a look at this answer How to change the order of scopes in a lens?\nfrom what I understand, the scopes actually do display the results first in first out\nAs for my personal experience, I have smart scopes disabled in the first place. Yet typing a search term takes quite some time to display the local results. I also have other users where smart scopes are enabled and it doesn't take much longer to display local results (though there is some difference in time).\nI think what slows down local result is not because some scopes are prioritized before others but maybe since more scopes means higher load on the processor. Also take into account that online scopes don't need much processing power concerning each scope alone, the computer just sends the query to online scopes and they send back the results, that may be the reason why online scopes display first. But together each scope contributes in putting load on the processor and therefore affecting the speed of the local scope. Actually displaying results itself can be considered as processor load.\n...You can wait for a better answer though\n", "Q: Deja-dup keeps asking me for my password every few minutes and doesn't seem to be doing anything Every time I run deja-dup it repeatedly asks me for my password every few mintues.

Resuming after suspension may reverse this lock.\nGo into hibernation, and once you're back with no connections available, type :\nrfkill unblock all\n\nThis should remove any lock applied on your interfaces. If you want to be more specific (not unlock all interfaces), use :\nrfkill list\n\nYou'll get numbers associated to your interfaces, which you can use in the unblock command afterwards, instead of all.\nEdit : maybe have a look here ?\nhttp://oleeekchoff.blogspot.ie/2012/05/restart-modulesservices-after.html\n", "Q: How do I install LibreOffice on 10.04 Server? I follow @Seth's answer to install LibreOffice4 on the server.\nHow do I install LibreOffice 4?\nI run dpkg -i *.deb without any error (as root). Then I didn't see any desktop-integration folder.

Here is my current /etc/rc.local:\n#!/bin/sh -e\n\n# Test 1\necho line1 > /home/myHome/rclog.txt\n\n# the mount\nmount /mnt/mediaDrive &> /home/myHome/mountlog.txt\n\n# Test 2\necho line2 >> /home/myHome/rclog.txt\n\nexit 0\n\nThe /mnt/mediaDrive is a noauto in fstab. It is a network share, hence the mount in rc.local.\nThe mount in the above script does not work at boot. After boot, the rclog.txt file contains both line1 and line2, and the mountlog.txt file is empty. This would indicate that all commands in the script were run successfully, however, the drive is not mounted.\nRunning sudo /etc/rc.local manually in a terminal does mount the network share.\nThere is nothing relevant in /var/syslog that I can see, and permissions for rc.local are 755. The relevant fstab entry:\n//192.168.1.100/home  /mnt/mediaDrive  cifs  noauto,credentials=/home/myHome/.mediaCredentials,uid=myName,gid=myGroup  0  0\n\nWhat's going on here? \n\nA: The problem must be that at boot time your network isn't available yet, and it's the reason why it mounts after boot. You must use another mechanisms to mount the device, like upstart. Example using upstart:\n# mount CIFS share\n\nstart on (local-filesystems and net-device-up IFACE!=lo)\nstop on runlevel [!2345]\n\npre-start script /bin/mount /mnt/mediaDrive\npre-stop script /bin/umount /mnt/mediaDrive\n\nYou can modify it to suit your needs. The file name must end with .conf and saved in the /etc/init directory.\n\nA: As noted by Braiam, at the time rc.local is run there is no network available for some reason. \nThis was the original reason I moved to the noauto + rc.local approach. So, although I'm not quite sure why, this approach is faulty.\nIn my case, a simple _netdev (instead of noauto) in /etc/fstab did the trick. \nNote that in my case, I had several dozen bind mounts to locations on the network drive. Each of these bind mounts also need a _netdev option in /etc/fstab, next to the bind option.\n\nA: Just add a \"sleep 5\" above your network command in the rc.local\nI had the problem to mount cifs access on my raspberry with osmc, with this 5s the network is up and the mount is OK\n\nA: Adding noauto,x-systemd.automount to my fstab line is what finally worked for me.

I have searched google but found nothing that much helpful. \nCan anyone please help?  \n\nA: You did (one of) the worse thing ever in Linux. You mustn't remove package without care of what it's being done. That said you will need a Live USB/CD with the same architecture of your installed system (if it's Ubuntu 64-bits the recovery must be 64-bits too) so you can chroot into the device.\nTo chroot\nAfter booting in your live system, open a terminal (for illustrative proposes I will use examples, you must change the values in bold).

If you installed /boot in another partition you must mount it too. In my case, / is sda1 so I proceed to mount it.\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\nsudo mount -o bind /proc /mnt/proc\nsudo mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev\nsudo mount -o bind /dev/pts /mnt/dev/pts\nsudo mount -o bind /sys /mnt/sys\nIf you didn't or aren't sure that you installed your /boot partition, just ignore this step:\nsudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot\nIn this case I'm assuming the my /boot is sda2. You also need internet:\nsudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/resolv.conf\n\nNow to chroot your system.

There are other questions like this bumbling around the site (that I'm working through) but I'm in the strange position where I think I know what I'm doing  but can't explain what's going on.\n\n\n*\n\n*I had 10x ~10GB files. None of them were open. Previews in Dolphin are turned off for files that big. Confirmed with lsof.\n\n*I selected the files and pressed Shift+Delete. This should skip the trash and nuke the files.\n\n*No progress was recorded. Usually Dolphin/KDE make a big fuss about deleting things.\n\n*The files are \"gone\" (not showing in Dolphin or the command line)\n\n*I'm still 100GB heavier than I should be. Most importantly, I'm at 100% disk use, which is why this is an urgent issue.\n\n*I've checked .trash on that drive and they weren't in there.\n\n*I've checked lsof again. They're not open.\n\n\nSo it seems like the inodes were deleted but the space wasn't freed. I would assume I have 100GB of orphan files. Hooray.\nIs there any way I can purge these orphan files from an active filesystem (I realise a fsck would probably shift them off an offline filesystem)? I can't take the filesystem offline because important things (system files, home items, etc) are bind-mounted out of here.\nOther details: the filesystem is EXT3 (I know, I should probably upgrade but changing FS is scaring when you're dealing with 4TB of data). The device is a mdadm RAID5 array.\n\nA: Ahh, deleting large files on ext3 takes a while since it has to zero out a lot of indirect blocks ( though I could have sworn the rm command blocks until it is done ).  Yes, you certainly should upgrade to ext4.  It shouldn't be scary when you have a backup, and you do have a backup right? ;)\nDon't forget; raid is not for preventing data loss, it is for preventing downtime due to mechanical failure.\n", "Q: How to determine command location?

However, when apache tries to access the site, it can't because the ownerships are all in my own username and not www-data.  So I changed all the ownerships:\n$ chown -R www-data:www-data domain-root-name\n\nApache is now happy, but I'm not, because I can no longer do anything with the files - which I need to do for development purposes.\nI tried doing the reverse (adding www-data to my own group), but that just meant that apache could no longer access the site.\nThere's lots of stuff about this all over the place but nothing works for me. Mainly the suggestion is to add yourself to the www-data group.  This is not sufficient, however, as I still can't edit the site's files.\nThe other suggestion is to set all permissions to 777, which makes lots of respondents hold their hands up in horror, even though it (obviously) works.\nIs there anyone out their who has solved this problem so that a developer can develop safely on a local apache installation?\n\nA: Personally, I set myself as the owner with www-data as the group:\nsudo chown -R konapun:www-data domain-root-name\n\nand then set the permissions to 754 (konapun: rwx, www-data: rx, other: r):\nsudo chmod -R 754 domain-root-name\n\nIf Apache has to create any files (temporary files, or maybe a templating engine which compiles templates), I set those individual directories to 774.\n\nA: I think I may have found an answer:\nhttp://www.vagrantup.com/\nVagrant is open source under a very permissive license (MIT).\nI haven't tried out every possible situation (for example automatically updating or adding a plugin to a development WordPress site), but the small amount of testing that I have done seems to indicate that I can leave the apache permissions at their default values in the vagrant VM and work in a Vagrant folder on the  host (my development box) without any problems of access.  The permissions on any apache installation on the host are irrelevant to this, and unaffected by anything you do.\nYou do have to use a non-standard port for the site you're developing, like 8080.  If you're using port-mapping (just a single extra line in the vagrant VM's config file) this sends requests on this port to the VM's port 80 assuming that's what you've specified in the config file.  And you would need to create a new VM for each project, but that's hardly the end of the world.\nFrom the little time I've spent using vagrant (just a day or so) it seems to be a very elegant and easy-to-use solution for this and other problems.\nIf anyone has any other pros and cons I'd be interested to hear them.\n", "Q: Can't install the proprietary ATI graphics driver When I try to install my graphics driver it shows that...\n\nOne or more tools requied for installation cannot be found on the\n  system. install the required tools before installing the fglrx driver.\n  optionaly, run the installer without --force to install the tools.\n  Forcing install will disable the AMD hardaware acceleration and may\n  make your syatem unstable. not recommended. see\n  /usr/share/ati/fglrx-install.log for more details.\n\nI installed fglrx and tried again, but it did not work.

I have made a few panoramas using Hugin, and I would love to be able navigate them from a browser. Pano2vr works nicely, however if there is an open source alternative I would love to use it.\nThank you for your time and answers.\n\nA: Pan0 is a very good looking panorama viewer\nIt is free, fast, and makes the panoramas look impressive. It uses a Flash-based spherical panorama viewer, which you can even embed into your own site or blog. Unlike Gigapan, Panoramio and similar sites, pan0.net takes care of perspective transforms, and allows to view the panorama as if you were rotating your head - it is not just zooming and panning a large flat image.

While it does have Linux tools, it's pretty expensive. But that's less of a problem when you have a client footing the bill.\nThere are others out there. Pannellum might be a suitable free replacement. I don't think the quality (and client side performance) is as good though (there's no scaling in it yet so you're loading the whole picture at once shudder). It just takes a rectangle matched-edge panorama (like Hugin can output).\nThere's also Pano2VR which looks quite interesting. It seems to build a shape in the browser (more facets than a cube but a lot less than a sphere) and textures that with individual images and that results in fairly decent performance. Not free though. And really not free if you want to take their branding off it.\n\nA: I was using http://www.dermandar.com/. It's not as good as Hugin cause it creating panorama automaticly, but it gives code for you site.\n", "Q: SSH - How to force execution of a script ( /etc/sshrc , ForceCommand, .. ? ) on login but still allow execution of the client's ~/.ssh/rc?

This because output redirection (the > operator) is done by the shell, not by ls, so sudo has no effect upon it. sudo has effect only on ls  -laR. To prevent this, you have to login as root:\nsudo -i\n\nThen you can use redirection:\nls -laR > hello\n\nOtherwise, you can run your bash command in a subshell with root privileges:\nsudo bash -c \"ls -laR > hello\"\n\nFinally, another option, instead to use redirection via the > operator, you can use tee command:\nls -laR | sudo tee hello\n\nYou don't have to use in this case sudo for ls command because users from the same group with root and all other users have read and execution permission in that directory.\n", "Q: Run a 32 bit software on a 64 bit architecture under Ubuntu 13.10 I need to use a software which already works fine in a 32 bit Ubuntu 10.10 virtual machine, with my 64 bit Ubuntu 13.10.

Does that mean that the bootloader is still there somewhere? If so, where exactly is it?\nThank you.\n\nA: The boot loader could be either an EFI-mode boot loader on the EFI System Partition (ESP) or a BIOS-mode boot loader in the MBR or on a Linux partition (although if you've deleted all of the Linux partitions, a partition is an unlikely location). You can check for and deal with these possibilities as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can mount the ESP in OS X by typing sudo mkdir /Volumes/ESP; sudo mount -t msdos /dev/disk0s1 /Volumes/ESP. (This assumes the ESP is the first partition on your disk, as it is by default. If it's elsewhere, you'll need to adjust the command appropriately.) You can then search for a Linux boot loader under /Volumes/ESP. It would probably be in /Volumes/ESP/EFI/ubuntu. Delete the boot loader (a .efi file), and optionally its entire directory.\n\n*You can erase the part of the MBR (or partition) that holds the BIOS boot code using dd. This is safest to do from Linux, so I recommend you boot a Linux live CD, then type sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=440 count=1. Be very careful with this command! A mistake in the parameters can cause you to trash the disk. OS X is less suitable for this because, IIRC, it's impossible to write part of a sector with OS X's dd, and it's critical that you wipe just the first 440 bytes of the sector. (Sectors are normally 512 bytes in size.)\n\n\nAlternatively, and a bit safer than the second option, you could upgrade from the abandoned rEFIt to its currently-maintained fork, rEFInd. You can then edit its refind.conf file to achieve your ends. You can exclude directories from scans for EFI boot loaders with the dont_scan_dirs line, or remove all BIOS-mode boot loaders with the scanfor line (omit the hdbios option). The drawback to excluding BIOS-mode boot loaders with rEFInd is that if you're dual-booting with Windows, you'll probably lose the ability to boot it.\n", "Q: Play/search a Shout Cast FM station on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS I am mainly looking for Tamil and Hindi channels.

I lost my unity and all the graphics gone then it took me hours to restore the system with old option.\nDo I not have any other option for installing graphics driver or any other remedy like installing Ubuntu 13.10?\nOutput of lspci command is:\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 3rd Gen Core processor Graphics Controller (rev 09)\n\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI Chelsea LP [Radeon HD 7730M]\n\n\nA: Most of times it could be about your graphic card gets warm and because your graphic card is integrated into your cpu the system thinks that cpu gets warm  \ninstall mesa-utils and mesa-utils-extras and reboot  , for installing use the following command-\nsudo apt-get install mesa-utils mesa-utils-extra  \n\nit will work for Intel Graphic Cards\nIf you are having NVIDIA graphic card then use bumblebee because mesa and NVIDIA will conflict with each other for sure.. to install bumblebee use-\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/testing\n\nthen for 12.04 and 13.04 use-\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia virtualgl linux-headers-generic \n\notherwise  for 13.10 use-\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia primus linux-headers-generi\n\n( for newcomes: the $ before this command is just an indicator that tells this command should be entered in a standard user command shell. if you want to use it just press <ctrl>+<alt>+<t> and copy-paste without this dollar mark )\nIf that doesnt work, try to \n\n\n*\n\n*Cleaning your laptop- As might be its because of just that, stopping fan from running  properly.\n\n*Update bios - After updating it can perform good operations like increasing compatibility .That solved my issue.\n\n*Update Kernel\nhope the very first suggestion will resolve your problem.\n\nA: It could be that you have an Intel CPU with integrated GPU and a discrete NVidia GPU. In Windows graphics driver optimizes the usage of GPU switching between NVidia and Intel GPUs depending on the load.\nIf this is the case, install bumblebee package to disable by default NVidia card. On my laptop this saves some battery and decreases fan noise with system temperature\n", "Q: How can I enable bonded network interfaces in Ubuntu 13.04/13.10/14.04 using NetworkManager This question is about network interface bonding in Ubuntu 12.04 Precise and newer (12.10 Quantal/13.04 Raring/13.10 Saucy/14.04 Trusty). Bonding is also known as network interface teaming, link aggregation, and port trunking.\nThere are instructions out there for setting up bonding by modifying /etc/network/interfaces (help.ubuntu.com, serverlab.ca) however I can't find any instructions or a tutorial on how to set it up using NetworkManager in Ubuntu.\n\nHow do I bond my wired (eth0) and wireless (wlan0) network interfaces together using NetworkManager?\nAdditional Info\nAs of NetworkManager 0.9.4 bonding is supported and NetworkManager 0.9.4 is included in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Precise. NetworkManager is then updated in Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal to 0.9.6 and \"slaves\" were added in Ubuntu 13.04 Raring with NetworkManager 0.9.8\n\nA: My answer is not the correct way, and doesn't provide the combined bandwidth of proper bonding, but does provide a sort of quick'n'dirty automatic \"failover\" that I've found acceptable for a laptop that is sometimes hooked up to ethernet.\nSet a static IP address on both the Home Ethernet and Home Wireless profiles that you use, and use identical settings on both connections, including the IP address.  When using wireless and hooking up to ethernet, once the connection is established all packets will begin routing through the ethernet adapter exclusively.  When unplugged, the packets will resume transfer through the wireless, assuming it is still actively connected.\nCompletely the wrong way to do it, and doesn't provide any of the advanced benefits of bonding, but it will work for most laptop users.\n\nA: I am using the Newest xUbuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahrir [or however you spell it] or this will work in ANY Ubuntu version or Flavor with or without network manager [UGH, that Network Manager software is a real pain compared to the interfaces definitions file IMHO].\nWouldn't you just sudo apt-get purge network manager and go ahead and use /etc/network/interfaces anyways?  It is there and once you manually specify [or not if you issue ifup [may need to use ifup -a (means all adapters) or possibly ifup after purging net manager it should reach out to DHCP and grab an address].\nI use OpenVPN and have to as part of that use /etc/network/interfaces to manually specify my bridge connection and it's options.  Once you define [the default file should just go for DHCP without modification] your connections using the interfaces file you can just issue ifdown -a or ifup -a to disconnect and then reconnect to network after any modifications without restarting the machine.\nLast once you use the interfaces file network manager will appear greyed out in the notification area.  This is normal you are no longer using Network Manager you are using ifup and ifdown.\nAnd yes this is related to ifconfig so if you use ifconfig in terminal then you are already used to this system and have used it to view adapter info already ifconfig is part of the same package as ifdown and ifup and should be fully present and ready to go even from a fresh install you don't need to apt-get install anything for this to be usable.\nViola follow any /etc/network/interfaces directions needed and they work [and you get rid of a small annoying piece of software [If you google net manager you see people getting disconnected/reconnected randomly and other misc issues]. If you know how to handle the interfaces file this is FAR more easy AND WAY MORE STABLE [and not hard to learn, only took me roughly 30 min to iron out advanced options like setting the default DNS search domains, enabling promiscuous mode, etc] :-D\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Where can I find the status of the released versions of Ubuntu? I want to know where I can find updated information about all the stable and in-development versions of Ubuntu, where I can find this information?\n\nThis question is meant to be a canonical question. It expects to answer the following questions:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Is X version stable yet?\n  \n*Is X version in beta?\n  \n*Is X version still supported?\n  \n*What versions are still supported?\n  \n*What are the versions in Beta/Alpha?\n  \n*Until where X version will be supported?\n  \n*Have X version ceased support?\n  \n*When will be X version released?\n  \n*Where I can download any release?\n  \n*When will the next LTS version of Ubuntu be released?\n  \n  \n  The list is not exhaustive.\n\n\nA: Over at Wikipedia they keep this useful graph:\n\n\nA: Supported Releases\nThe currently supported releases will always be in the Wiki page of Ubuntu at:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/ReleaseTeam#Releases.Current\nThis includes the current point release, Long Term Support release and regular releases.\nFuture (in development) Releases\nFor future (beta/alpha) versions of Ubuntu you may check:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/ReleaseTeam#Releases.Future\nOlder (EOL) Releases\nTo know the supported dates of older (EOL) releases, you may visit:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/ReleaseTeam#Releases.End_of_Life\n\nAll releases can be downloaded at http://releases.ubuntu.com, for older releases you may look at http://old-releases.ubuntu.com.\nThe release schedule of any version will be at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/<codename>/ReleaseSchedule, replacing <codename> with the codename for that release, e.g. for Trusty Tahr:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/TrustyTahr/ReleaseSchedule\n", "Q: Can't login to User profile on Ubuntu 12.04 When I try to log into my user profile, the screen turns black and then just returns to the log-in menu.\nWhat to do?\nSchould I \"repair\" Ubuntu. If yes, how is it done?\nI can't choose to \"repair\" like in Windows when I boot up with the Ubuntu installation USB I got.\n\nA: Got the problem, found the answer :\n\n\n*\n\n*Log into your account using a terminal, which you can reach using Ctrl + Alt + F2.\n\n*Look at the permissions for your .Xauthority file, using ls -la ~/.Xauthority.\n\n\nIt needs to be readable and writeable by your user :\n-rw------- 1 you yourgroup .Xauthority\n\n(usually, group and user are the same for regular users)\nIf your permissions are invalid, you can apply a fix by doing :\nchown you:yourgroup ~/.Xauthority\nchmod 600 ~/.Xauthority\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Then go back to your display manager with Ctrl + Alt + F7, and try again !\n\n*If it still fails, have a look a your X11 logs, and share : cat /var/log/Xorg.log.0 | tail -n50\n\nA: Regarding not being able to log in on the usual Ubuntu 12.04 screen. I had this problem after installing some software. After checking that my user name owned my home directory and files such as .Xauthority I read an article about checking the main /tmp directory permissions and ownership. To my horror I found that the software package install script had taken ownership of the /tmp directory, which meant that no user could log in because they did not have permission to use the /tmp directory, which all users do require.\nThe solution was:\nPress the CTRL, ALT, and F1 keys at the same time when in the usual log in screen.\nThis takes you to a login request. Then enter your normal user name and press enter.\nWhen prompted enter your usual password and press enter.\nYou should then be shown a line ending with the $ sign.\nThis will take you into your home directory, for example /home/tim.\nChange to the main root directory by typing in 'cd /' and press the enter key.\ntype in 'sudo chmod 777 /tmp' and press the enter key, then enter your normal password.\ntype in 'sudo chmod +t /tmp' and press the enter key and then your password.\ntype in 'sudo chown root:root /tmp' and press the enter key then you password.\ntype in 'ls -l /' and press enter key.\nyou should see in the file list the entry 'drwxrwxrwt root root\nThe permissions are now correct.\nPress the 'CTRL, ALT, and F7' keys to return to the usual Ubuntu login screen.\nHopefully this will now work.\nTim\n", "Q: apt-get Could not connect to a weird IP/port, why?

Really confused about that as well!\n\nA: This is most likely due you using a proxy, you can check using:\nsudo apt-get -o Debug::Acquire::http=true update\n\nThis will give you more hindsight. You can check your configuration files for some proxy configured:\ngrep -i proxy /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/* /etc/apt/apt.conf\n\nIf none is found, check your Network Settings in the GUI and your environmental variables:\necho $http_proxy $HTTP_PROXY\n\nDepending where you find it, you must unconfigure it. There could be also that the servers are down but since you changed server is difficult this happen.\n", "Q: Kernel headers after upgrading kernels from 3.5.7 to 3.9.0 I upgraded my kernel on Ubuntu 12.04 in order to gain access to the include/uapi/  headers.\nThe full kernel version that I upgraded to is 3.9.0-030900-generic, following this tutorial.   \nUnfortunately, the headers seem to have remained the same because the uapi directory doesn't exist. \nTo diagnose the problem, I tried to download the source for my 3.9 kernel with:\nsudo apt-get source linux-image-$(uname -r)\n\nHowever the output is\nPicking 'linux' as source package instead of 'linux-image-3.9.0-030900-generic'\n\nAnd this results in the kernel source for 3.2 being downloaded instead of 3.9.\nWhat action must I take to install the kernel/headers properly?\nI looked through these two posts before posting for insights, to no avail:\n\n\n*\n\n*update Linux Headers when Kernel is updated\n\n*Why are linux-headers not upgraded by apt-git dist-upgrade\n\nA: I suggest you download and install the headers appropriate to your architecture; either 32- or 64-bit, from here: http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.9-raring/\n", "Q: Grub rescue unknown filesystem...the ultimate hopelessness I know the question has been asked so many times but in my case whatever I do as indicated in the following post (all solutions are tried) 'unknown filesystem' is the ultimate reply..\nGrub rescue - error: unknown filesystem\nI also tried live USB of boot-disk-recovery which too fails to identify my device partition holding Ubuntu 12.04 x32 (which by the way is sdb2) Although it created bootscript which is attached below.\n Boot Info Script e7fc706 + Boot-Repair extra info      [Boot-Info 31Jan2013]\n\n\n============================= Boot Info Summary: ===============================\n\n => Syslinux MBR (4.04 and higher) is installed in the MBR of /dev/sda.\n => Grub2 (v1.99) is installed in the MBR of /dev/sdb and looks at sector 1 of \n    the same hard drive for core.img. core.img is at this location and looks \n    for (,msdos2)/boot/grub on this drive.\n\nsda1: __________________________________________________________________________\n\n    File system:       vfat\n    Boot sector type:  SYSLINUX 4.05 20120702\n    Boot sector info:  Syslinux looks at sector 1030576 of /dev/sda1 for its \n                       second stage.

It displayed that hd structure is present but I can't hook up in the Linux partition nether testdisk was able to list files of that particular partition\nUPDATE 3\nThis is the 3rd day & still I can't get it to work so I am writing a prologue of how did my problem really started...This 80gb drive though is my internal PC drive but frequently I also attach this as an external drive to my laptop. The drive was working fine for about 3 months.\nUnder linux Mint (in my laptop) I attached it 3 days before (& I often do that) as an external USB drive. There I transferred ~16gb of data to its NTFS partition /dev/sdb5. It went smoothly with ~25mb/sec rate & then I (what I do always) issued through context menu 'Safely remove drive' & it removed drive (I think that was what supposed to happen) nothing special! but later when I tried to boot it nightmare started...\nAfter a quick Google search I must acknowledge that Linux may also corrupt your Grub & all even when drive isn't properly unmounted, thats really a shame to find because in windows I just pull out my USBs when transfer finishes but yes in *nix I do have found that even when transfer is completed & you pull out drive only to find nothing has been transferred! Bad luck if you used cut/paste\n\nA: Several problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows really wants to be on a primary partition, not a logical\npartition in the extended partition, and that's the partition which\nshould have the boot flag, not the linux partition, which does not\ncare.  * Oh its just for data, nevermind.\n\n*Maybe you really don't have a filesystem on sdb2. \n    Everything seems to indicate that.  So just reinstall Ubuntu there\n    (After fixing the Windows partition problem).\n\n\n\nWith no blkids being listed for the partitions, it does not look good for recovery.  I suppose you could check the partition with dd, grab a few blocks at a time in locations spread across the partition, and look for strings, to see if the data even exists.  But if it's just configuration data, definitely not worth the effort.  For more valuable data, if the usual tools don't help, there's always brute force, dd the whole partition, split it up into manageable chunks, look for strings of interest, then edit the chunk with the interesting stuff -- a massive undertaking.\n", "Q: My Postfix server became a spam server.

I'm doing some benchmarking on the compression of files with/without a hypervisor using gzip. The command I'm running to test how long a file takes to complete is :\ntime gzip -c filename.txt > filename.txt.gz\n\nI'm a little confused, because the first time I run the command on a new file the time is always ~twice as long as any subsequent test until I reboot. For example:\n1st run: .50 seconds\n2nd run: .25 seconds\n3rd run: .26 seconds\n...\n\nWhy would there be such a difference in time? Does gzip store the compression in memory or somewhere else like a temp file?\nThanks for any help!\n\nA: While gzip doesn't cache your files, Linux does. Any memory not required by running programs is used as a disk cache, and after the first time you read filename.txt it will be added to the cache. So provided it is not modified in the meanwhile, subsequently reading the file will get the copy already in memory, which probably accounts for the speed-up.\n", "Q: Windows 8.1 is Completely Blocking Ubuntu A few days ago, I upgraded my Windows 8 Lenovo U410 ideapad to Windows 8.1, and it proved to be a terrible mistake. It seems like the only visible change that it has made is adding the start button. Meanwhile, it disabled my audio, and I had to go and reinstall drivers from Lenovo's website. Even worse, it is completely blocking me from running Ubuntu in any way possible.\nI have my hard disk partitioned into three main partitions: 100GB for Windows (in NTFS); 100GB for Ubuntu (in ext4...I think); and a 550GB storage drive (in NTFS). Then on start up, the Ubuntu GRUB screen (this one) would come up and I would be able to choose between booting into Ubuntu and Windows 8. However, now after the update, I boot straight into Windows 8.1, and cannot access the Ubuntu file system.\nThis wouldn't be that big of a problem, if it wasn't for the fact that three almost-finished Honors English papers are on there, and I NEED them. So first I tried booting into the Ubuntu partition from the bios, which didn't work, and neither did trying to boot into it from the \"Use a Device\" menu in the Windows \"Advanced Startup\" menu. Next, I tried moving the Ubuntu partition to the first spot in the boot sequence, and starting up my computer again. When that had no effect, I created an Ubuntu USB drive, and went through all the same steps (this is what the answers to questions similar to mine recommend). Again, no result. I've also noticed that even after changing the boot sequence in the BIOS, Windows Boot Manager forces itself back to the front.\nI'm at a loss for what to do, and I really need those English papers, so any help is MUCH appreciated. Thank you for reading this far, and thanks in advance for any advice.\n\nA: I think Windows has re-written your main disk's first sectors, to put its own boot loader back on.

This method, you simply plug in the cable from the hub into the PC.  This is an older method, most modern PCs use wireless.\n\n*Wireless connect - find the wireless signal (top right, near the volume) then find the network you are trying to connect to ... select it, and enter your network key.\nNow, once your computer is on the network; and assuming your printer is also on the network, you should be able to connect to it by pointing the computer at it (perhaps via the printer's IP address), and then installing drivers.

I installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my old HP Pavilion ze1210 laptop. When I boot to Ubuntu it shows less than half of the screen; the rest is garbled and has a mixture of red and black squares. The top portion that is somewhat visible when the computer boots becomes distorted when I move the cursor (a red square) over it.\n\nA: You do not have enough RAM in your HP Pavilion ze1210 laptop to install Ubuntu 12.04, and as a result you are getting visual artifact errors. Ubuntu 12.04 requires at least 384MB of RAM, but according to Google your laptop has only 256MB of RAM. Xubuntu, which is a lightweight version of Ubuntu, requires 512MB RAM, so you cannot install Xubuntu either.\nSo here is how to solve your problem. Your laptop meets the system requirements for Lubuntu 13.10, so install the lightweight Lubuntu 13.10. Lubuntu 13.10 has a minimalistic desktop environment that resembles Windows XP in look and feel.

In this case, you want the Drop to root shell prompt option so press the ᛎ Down arrow to get to that option, and then press Enter to select it.\n\n*Once you're at the root shell prompt, if you have forgotten your username as well, type ls /home (small letters & not capitals).

I've had an interesting terminal session in byobu, and I'd like to save the terminal output (commands and all) to a file - how can I do that?\nAccording to the byobu man page:\n\nCtrl-a ~ - Save the current window's scrollback buffer\n\nThis may indeed be doing something, but I've found no indication of where and under what name it might be saved.\n\nA: If you're used not to use the F-keys then this might work for you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ctrl+a, [: enter the scrollback mode\n\n*Space enter the copy mode (optional)\n\n*Enter exit the scrollback or copy mode\n\n*Ctrl+a, ]: paste what was copied\n\n\nWhere Ctrl+a is your tmux (default Byobu backend) prefix/escape sequence.\n\nA: An old question still not workably answered for earlier byobu versions, and I hit the need again.\nThis time I found a workable solution. From man byobu:\nSCROLLBACK, COPY, PASTE MODES\n\n   Each  window  in  Byobu  has  up to 10,000 lines of scrollback history,\n   which you can enter and navigate using the alt-pgup and alt-pgdn  keys.\n   Exit  this  scrollback mode by hitting enter.  You can also easily copy\n   and paste text from scrollback mode.  To do so, enter scrollback  using\n   alt-pgup  or  alt-pgdn,  press the spacebar to start highlighting text,\n   use up/down/left/right/pgup/pgdn to select the text, and press enter to\n   copy  the  text.  You can then paste the text using alt-insert or ctrl-\n   a-].\n\n\n*\n\n*I hit F7 to enter scrollback mode,\n\n*Space to start selecting,\n\n*gg to scroll to the top of the buffer (thanks @GeorgeMarian)\n\n*\n\n*If that doesn't work, try this: either with lots of Page up or : followed by the largest line number (indicated top right) and Page up to get to the top of that page,\n\n\n\n*Enter to copy (to byobu's clipboard, not a terminal/system one),\n\n*then cat > my-byobu-dump.txt in the terminal,\n\n*Alt+Insert or ctrl+A,] to paste (again, from byobu's clipboard)\n\n*Ctrl+D to close the file.\n\n\nA: Or, you can simply use Byobu's hotkey for this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Shift-F7\nThat will take your history and put it into $BYOBU_RUN_DIR/printscreen.\n\nA: Shift + F7 only works as expected if you have the EDITOR environment variable set to an editor within byobu. For some reason, in some cases (e.g. for me when connecting through SSH to another computer), setting this variable in ~/.profile is not enough. One place to set it so that byobu always reads it is in ~/.bashrc. Copy something like the following to your ~/.bashrc:\n# Although this is set in ~/.profile, it is set here as well so that in a \n# remote byobu session, Shift+F7 copies the output to a Vim buffer. See:\n# https://askubuntu.com/questions/382750/how-to-save-scrollback-history-in-byobu\nexport EDITOR='vim'\n\n\nA: Use Ctrl+A+~ to copy the scrollback buffer to the byobu clipboard.\nPaste the text into an editor using Alt+insert  or Ctrl+A+].\n(Adjust Ctrl+A if you've changed your escape key.)\n\nA: If you need to save the history use Shift + F7 shorcut. Like @dustin-kirkland says.\nIf you prefer to scroll up and down in your terminal, It depends if you use tmux or screen. Examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*Screeen:\n\n\n*\n\n*CTRL + a: If you use [ then, you enter in scroll mode like @ikar-pohorský says.\n\n\n*Tmux:\n\n\n*\n\n*ALT + PageUp: you scroll up.\n\n*ALT + PageDown: you scroll down.\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Ctrl+a, ? shows me that capture-pane and save-buffer are the key commands to save scrollback. \nbind-key    -T root   S-F7             capture-pane -S -32768 ; save-buffer /dev/shm/byobu-asari-JG2wDS8x/printscreen ; delete-buffer ; new-window -n PRINTSCREEN \" /dev/shm/byobu-asari-JG2wDS8x/printscreen\"\n\nWhen Shift+F7 doesn't work for you (e.g. when your terminal software consumes F-key events), try just as help says: Ctrl+a, :, capture-pane -S -32768 ; save-buffer /path/to/printscreen and Enter.\n\nA: Select the text you wish to save, then press Control + Shift  + C\nNext, open your favorite text editor. Then paste the content here using Control +   V .\nFinally save the file in the desired location.\nTERMINAL TIP OF THE DAY: When trying to copy something in terminal do it as usual expect use Control + Shift  + C instead of Control +C, and paste as usual. For pasting something that is on the clipboard into the terminal use Control + Shift  + V.\n\nA: Ctrl+A+] will work if you type from 1 to 20 times or more with abracodabra.

I'm fairly new to Linux, and was quite surprised when networking was completely broken after the swap. Another disclaimer is that I didn't build our virtual servers to begin with, and have very limited understanding of how Linux-KVM works. Once the motherboard was swapped, I then ran the LifeCycle Controller application and applied a variety of upgrades (the most notable of which would be firmware upgrades for the NICs). After a lot of research, I finally managed to \"fix\" networking by editing the /etc/udev/70-persistent-net.rules file. Within that file, I removed the 2 old Broadcom (bnx2) entries for the prior motherboard, and then renamed the new bnx2 eth2 and eth3 to eth0 and eth1 respectively. I then moved eth0 and eth1 to the top of the document. The (igb) entries are for a PCI-based Intel Gigabit NIC that's currently unused. Here are the contents of my 70-persistent-net.rules file:\n# This file was automatically generated by the /lib/udev/write_net_rules\n# program, run by the persistent-net-generator.rules rules file.\n#\n# You can modify it, as long as you keep each rule on a single\n# line, and change only the value of the NAME= key.\n\n# PCI device 0x14e4:0x163b (bnx2)\nSUBSYSTEM==\"net\", ACTION==\"add\", DRIVERS==\"?*\", ATTR{address}==\"78:2b:cb:20:9d:71\", ATTR{dev_id}==\"0x0\", ATTR{type}==\"1\", KERNEL==\"eth*\", NAME=\"eth0\"\n\n# PCI device 0x14e4:0x163b (bnx2)\nSUBSYSTEM==\"net\", ACTION==\"add\", DRIVERS==\"?*\", ATTR{address}==\"78:2b:cb:20:9d:72\",    ATTR{dev_id}==\"0x0\", ATTR{type}==\"1\", KERNEL==\"eth*\", NAME=\"eth1\"\n\n# PCI device 0x8086:0x10c9 (igb)\nSUBSYSTEM==\"net\", ACTION==\"add\", DRIVERS==\"?*\", ATTR{address}==\"90:e2:ba:0c:7e:f9\", ATTR{dev_id}==\"0x0\", ATTR{type}==\"1\", KERNEL==\"eth*\", NAME=\"eth2\"\n\n# PCI device 0x8086:0x10c9 (igb)\nSUBSYSTEM==\"net\", ACTION==\"add\", DRIVERS==\"?*\", ATTR{address}==\"90:e2:ba:0c:7e:f8\", ATTR{dev_id}==\"0x0\", ATTR{type}==\"1\", KERNEL==\"eth*\", NAME=\"eth3\"\n\nThis resolved the networking being completely broken (couldn't ping the gateway before), but a much more major issue has persisted where the server hardware randomly reboots.

The final build will have two mSATA SSDs (both separately 256GB) and two SATA HDD (500GB) in RAID. So logically three drives. My goal is to have Ubuntu 13.10 on one SSD as the primary boot OS and Windows 8.1 installed on the second SSD as secondary. Furthermore the two HDDs in RAID will be for swap and /home, partitioned so Windows and Ubuntu recognize it.\nMy board is an EFI board though it does support legacy BIOS. My machine shipped as a barebones computer (no CPU, GPU, RAM, storage or modules). I installed the hardware on my own. So this will all be on clean, new hardware, with no prior installs or setup. I've done setup on clean installs, and I've done partitioning before. I've never done anything with UEFI or any partitioning this exotic before, and I'm struggling trying to work this all out. \n\nA: You can just install one SSD and install an operating system to it. Then install just the second SSD and install the second to that.\nInstalling Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\nNot sure what type of RAID you want that will easily work with both Windows & Ubuntu. I do not know RAID, but prefer to have the drives separate and do my own backup to the other drive which some archiving. With RAID there is no backup, just duplication. \nI would suggest gpt partitioning for all drives. But Windows only boots from gpt drives with UEFI. Ubuntu can boot from gpt drives with UEFI or BIOS, but you really need both systems installed in the same boot mode to easily dual boot.\nIf a 256GB SSD, that would be very large for / (root). I have a 60GB SSD and have two different / including /home inside root, so user settings are also on fast drive. But all data in in rotating drive and linked back to /home on SSD. My /home then is mostly the hidden settings and any normally hidden folder with more data like Firefox profile also gets moved to data partition on rotating drive.\nFor the Total space you want for Ubuntu:\nUbuntu's standard install is just / (root) & swap, but it is better to add another partition for /home if allocating over 30GB.:\nOnly if gpt -  all partitions in gpt are primary add these two first:\ngpt: 300 MB efi FAT32 w/boot flag (for UEFI boot or future use for UEFI, you only can have one per drive, so if already existing do not attempt another)\ngpt: 1 MB No Format w/bios_grub flag (for BIOS boot not required for UEFI)\n\nfor gpt(GUID) or MBR(msdos) partitioning\nUbuntu partitions - smaller root only where hard drive space is limited.\nIf total space less than about 30GB just use / not separate /home or standard install.\n1. 10-25 GB Mountpoint / primary or logical beginning ext4(or ext3)\n2. all but 2 GB Mountpoint /home logical beginning ext4(or ext3) or inside / and separate data partition(s) on rotating drive.\n3. 2 GB Mountpoint swap logical\n\nDepending on how much memory you have you may not absolutely need swap but having some is still recommended. I do not hibernate (boots fast enough for me) but if hibernating then you need swap equal to RAM in GiB not GB. And if dual booting with windows a shared NTFS partition is also recommended. But you usually cannot create that as part of the install, just leave some space. Or partition in advance (recommended).\nOne advantage of partitioning in advance is that the installer will use the swap space to speed up the install.

I thought first thing my company should do is to use ubuntu which is completely different from windows.\n So I asked this question here and please some help.\n\nA: \nShould my company use linux(ubuntu) to become more secure than windows 8 ?\n\nThe choice of operating system is not what makes your company more secure. I can install Ubuntu and set UFW up so even a 5 year old Chinese girl from Xia He (*) can access your server and issue an rm command. And it is also possible to hammer down Windows so not even an expert can break in to it.\nYes, Linux/Ubuntu comes with more sane defaults but that is also due to Linux being multi-user from the get go and Windows starting as a single user machine. Linux/Ubuntu needs to hide things on the system itself from users so the evil outside should not be able to do more.\nIt is the administrator of those systems that makes your systems secure.\nLinux/Ubuntu has a better track record than Windows when it comes to viruses: they are nearly non existent and the viruses that do exist have not left the laboratory yet. So that might be an option.\n\nWhat also the precautions to be implemented to secure the company network ?\n\nWhen someone from then outside connects to your inner system make sure to do this over a secure line (think https, ssl for websites you host, vpn for ssh).\nWe have a mixed network. Our routers block/grant traffic, most here use Windows PCs for daily usage. We employees are allowed to use the operating system we prefer as long as we can do what is needed to be done. And our servers and our clients servers are all Ubuntu, some CentOS and some are SCO Open Server. And all our own servers also use UFW as an extra barrier. \n(*) monastery in eastern China.\n", "Q: Disabling the Ubntu desktop enviourment I have Ubuntu 13.04 setup I Want to disable the feature(Dash , Default search, left click and right click option on desktop) of Ubuntu desktop environment .\nI found these commands for disabling right click\nTo disable right click for just desktop :\nxmodmap -e \"pointer = 1 2 99\"\n\nTo apply for system wide:\nxmodmap -e 'pointer = 1 2 0 4 5 6 7 8 9'\n\nare there commands to disable dash and left click functionality too..??\n\nA: Finally got a way out of it i am running Ubuntu in gnome-shell environment .\nIn Gnome-shell all the unity facilities as dashboard etc, are not present .\nalso u can costomize the pane menu which is more or less like full filing my requirement.\nfor disabling right click i am using above command .\n", "Q: No screens found with usable configuration (Live-CD), boot-repair CLI I have an MSi GE70 Laptop (Graphics: nvidia GeForce GT650M).

For me it's weird that the installation is able to show a nice GUI where the live-CD doesn't find a screen.\nIf I am able to boot into installed Ubuntu, I probably will run into the same graphics problems, but maybe it's easier to fix them on an installed version?\n\nA: I have faced a similar problem.  I only recently updated my packages, so it could be related.  I fixed it with a full purge and reinstall of the nvidia drivers:\nsudo apt-get -y purge --auto-remove nvidia.*\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get -y install nvidia-current-updates nvidia-settings-updates\n\nWorth a try.  Probably remove any /etc/X11/xorg.conf if you have one of those.\nHTH\n\nA: Try using the USB flash drive or CD-R version of my rEFInd boot manager. If you did not use a separate /boot partition, it should boot up both Linux and Windows with no extra configuration required. You can then install rEFInd to your hard disk by installing the Debian-package version and experiment with boot options and X configuration options from your regular installation, which is likely to be better than experimenting with a live CD.\nAs to the X configuration, try this in a text-mode login:\n\n\n*\n\n*Type sudo su. This will log you in as root.\n\n*Type Xorg -configure. This should create a file called /root/xorg.conf.new.\n\n*Copy /root/xorg.conf.new to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.\n\n*Type startx to launch X.\n\n\nAt this point you can begin debugging. X might or might not start. If it does, log out and reboot, which should bring up X normally. If X doesn't start, though, consult any guide you can find on configuring xorg.conf. (I don't have any URLs handy, but I'm sure a Web search will turn up dozens of them.) You'll probably have to adjust the Screen section, and specifically change the Driver line to tell it to use whatever driver works for your system. (The fbdev driver will probably work, but with poor speed. The nv driver might work with better speed or not at all; and nouveau could provide still better speed or fail completely. If you install the Nvidia proprietary driver, it might or might not work; I believe its driver name is nvidia.) You may also need to adjust the ServerLayout section to remove unused Screen devices.\n\nA: have you tried command update-grub than restart, \nif that does not help,\ntry https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair \n", "Q: Configuring a usb modem in Ubuntu 12.04 - toshiba laptop Strange Problem in Ubuntu\nI have installed Ubuntu 12.04 64 bit version in my Desktop and when I plugged in 2 different USB modems they were promptly recognized and was able to configure them using network manager.

(command-line) SUMMARY \nDoes Ubuntu take advantage of multiple swap partitions on separate physical media, from a load sharing point of view?  i.e. if one drive with a swap partition is burdened with i/o, will it utilise (other) swap space that resides on a different physical hard drive?  \nBACKGROUND\nBuilding a headless home server (command-line only responses, please!). I usually put the o/s, the virtual/swap space and apps+data each on separate drives.  While I think I've got directories and mount points clear (even managed to automount an NFS folder from a NAS), swap still seems a little hazy to me...\n\n\n*\n\n*The Ubuntu install sequence partitioned my main drive with LVM [still unsure if LVM was the best choice for a headless server; but this is not a question, just an observation]\n\n*I've got two additional drives I'd like to use.  While I see guides for GParted, detail regarding fdisk doesn't seem as thorough.\n\n*I realise there's also the \"swappiness\" setting, but I'm more curious about the possible benefits if Ubuntu is sufficiently \"device-aware\" to take into account an i/o burdened device vs. an idle one, should it have multiple swap areas at its disposal.\n\nA: At boot mountall commands calls the swapon utility. \nThe swapon manpage says :\nCalls to swapon normally occur in the system boot scripts making all swap devices available, so that the  paging  and swapping activity is interleaved across several devices and files.\nAs pages are interleaved across different devices one can assume that different swap spaces on different devices would performs better (like a RAID 0) than a single swap space on a single device.\nMy opinion is that tuning swap access is pointless, as when you got to a point where swap access is a critical resource, your system is almost unusable, disk access is  1000x slower than memory access.\nBetter tune the memory usage by removing unnecessary daemons, checking software parameters.... \nYou should find useful informations on memory footprint here: \nhttp://linux-mm.org/LinuxMMDocumentation\n\nA: While this doesn't actually answer my question regarding swap behaviour, I thought I'd at least share some useful commands when working with hard drives and partitions from the command-line.\n\n!!

Running Xubuntu 13.04.\n\nA: This can be frustrating, that is for sure!  One quick and easy workaround would to just use bash instead of sh.\nYou may be defaulting to using /bin/sh as your shell instead of /bin/bash. Personally I like bash better as it has Tab-autocompletion turned on out of the box.\nCheck to determine your shell:\n$ echo $SHELL\n/bin/sh               <-- this may be your issue\n\nLaunch bash to ensure this fixes the issue:\nbash\n\nNow try the Tab-autocompletion. If it works, then change your default shell from /bin/sh to /bin/bash using the chsh (change shell) command for that user:\nchsh -s /bin/bash USERNAME\n\nLogout and log back in. Now all new shells will Tab-autocomplete.\n\nA: it completes file name only if the initials you are providing is unique , and don’t have any other possible file name:\nSuppose you have two file file1expo and file2expo in working directory-\nthen using gedit file<<tab>> will not work because it has two possible outcomes, where as gedit file1<<tab>> will work.\nIf you want to list all the files starting with initials like xaa then simply use \nls \"xaa\" \n\nit will show all the files names with starting characters  xaa.\n\nA: To enable smart completion\nUsing sudo and your favorite editor, edit your /etc/bash.bashrc file. \nUncomment the following lines, by removing the # in the beginning of the lines:\n#if [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then\n# . /etc/bash_completion\n#fi\n\nNow you can use tab completion to power your way through commands.\n", "Q: Repost screencasts for Lubuntu?

My fork of it, rEFInd, is under active development and includes features to help with booting Linux, so it's a better choice than rEFIt in most cases.\nUnless you're triple-booting with Windows or some other BIOS-only OS, I recommend at least trying to get a native EFI-mode boot of Linux working. This means you should not use Boot Camp or create a hybrid MBR -- in fact, much of my reason for offering this advice is because hybrid MBRs are so dangerous, as the linked-to page describes. That said, some users with some models report that some hardware (typically the video hardware) works poorly or not at all when booted in EFI mode, so a BIOS-mode boot of Linux may be necessary. I recommend you consider this a fallback position, though.\nI've written a Web page on installing Ubuntu on a Mac in EFI mode; see here. Unfortunately, that page is a bit outdated, and my only Mac is a rather old 32-bit model, so some details are likely to be different for users of newer 64-bit Macs. Still, it may be a useful reference.\n\nA: Take A Look Here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MactelSupportTeam/CommunityHelpPages\nI usually recommend Refit, But First Check out the link.\n\nA: I set up a Mac to dual boot so that Ubuntu boots first; you have to hold option to get to the Mac EFI. I am sure there is a name for this, but I am not good with the terms.\nThe basic steps were\n\n\n*\n\n*create Mac Live USB\n\n*reformat the hard drive\n\n*partition the drives, making sure the one to instal the Mac OS on is formatted for Mac and the Linux drive is formatted for Linux\n\n*Install Linux\n\n*Install Mac\n\n\nI did this because the consensus everywhere I looked is that boot camp is junk. This works great on my box for both operating systems, although the recovery for Mac disappeared, so you should definitely have a recovery USB.\n", "Q: Multithreaded HTTP Downloader I am looking for a command line tool that can download multiple urls with multiple threads e.g.\nwget2 -n 5 http://stackoverflow.com/ http://askubuntu.com/ http://bobo.com/\n\nWhere -n = number of threads. I have come across Axel, but when I give it multiple URLs, it only downloads one.\nI will be downloading HTML files.\n\nA: Aria2 is the best solution for this if you want CLI. Aria2 supports multiple connections, multiple threads and multiple sources.\nAnother benefit of Aria2 is that is works as a plugin for uGet so you can use the power of Aria2 with a nice easy to use GUI.\nAria2 - CLI - http://aria2.sourceforge.net/\n\n\n*\n\n*by default, Aria2 does 5 connections but can be adjusted with the \"-j\" parameter.\n\n*aria2c -j 10 http://url.com/path/to/file.ext\nuGet - GUI - http://ugetdm.com\n\n\n*\n\n*multiple connections is adjustable in GUI when adding a download.\n\n\n\nUpdate: based on OP's batch needs\nuGet supports batch downloads via .txt, .html, clipboard and many more methods. While admittedly not CLI, I think it solves the problem quite well. I created a video tutorial to explain the various methods, the GUI has changed since this recording but the functionality is still relevant.\n\nA: All of the above and linked suggestions do not take two unique URLs. They only take URLs that are mirrors of the same file.\nI've found a few programs that do this:\nThe best is puf (apt-get install puf), use puf url1 url2 etc.\nThen there is HTTRACK, which requires a lot of tinkerings and has some limites I can't get past (speed and connection limits)\nDownThemAll for Firefox is very good if you don't need a command line app.\nUPDATE\nI've since found puf has a tendency to crash. The best solution is to create a .txt file with URLs on new lines, e.g.\nhttp://google.com/\nhttp://yahoo.com/\n\nSave that are urls.txt (for example) then run the command:\ncat urls.txt | xargs -n 1 -P 10 wget -q\n\n-n specifies to select each line from the file\n-p specifies the number of URLs you would like to download in parallel.\n", "Q: Ubuntu corrupt PATH So I modified profile file under /etc/ and now I cannot use commands like sudo, ls, etc., but I cannot modify this file without sudo.\nThe question is: how can i get to sudo and gedit.

I need to convert image and audio into avi video files for use with a video mixing tool that only accepts avi video.\nHow do I:\n\n\n*\n\n*convert mp3 audio to avi without video channel\n\n*convert jpg image to avi without sound\n\n\nWithout unnecessary re-encoding, if possible. Also, I think I can use black background image as an input, but I'd rather do without video channel altogether, if possible.\nI would prefer a simple command-line solution, if possible.\n\nA: *\n\n*Get the real ffmpeg. The fake ffmpeg from the repository is buggy. This command will download a recent static build of ffmpeg, so there is no installation required and it will not interfere with anything from the repository:\nwget http://ffmpeg.gusari.org/static/32bit/ffmpeg.static.32bit.$(date +\"%F\").tar.gz\ntar xzvf ffmpeg.static.32bit.$(date +\"%F\").tar.gz\n\n\n*Run the commands (note the ./ before ffmpeg):\n\n\n*\n\n*convert mp3 audio to avi without video channel\n./ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -map 0:a -codec:a copy output.avi\n\n\n*convert jpg image to avi without sound\n./ffmpeg -loop 1 -i input.jpg -codec:v copy -t 10 output.avi\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*The album art in MP3 files is considered to be a video stream by ffmpeg. Since you wanted no video using -map 0:a tells ffmpeg to copy only the audio stream from input 0 (the first input is 0, and in your case it is also the only input). Otherwise the default behavior is to include one stream per stream type from the input to the output (see stream selection for more info). Alternatively, -vn can be used instead.\n\n*-codec:a copy will enable stream copy mode. This just re-muxes the stream, so there is no re-encoding and no loss of audio quality.\n\n*-loop 1 will loop the input file, and -t 10 creates a 10 second output; otherwise it will loop forever. If you want a certain number of frames use -vframes instead.\n\n*By default the input image will have a frame rate of 25. If you want to change that then use -r as an input option (before -i). The output will then inherit the input frame rate. If you want to change the output frame rate as well, then add another -r as an output option. ffmpeg will then drop or duplicate frames to reach your desired output frame rate.\n\n*AVI is a container format and can use a variety of audio and video formats, so if something claims to only support \"AVI\" then you should ask for more specific information.\n\nA: You need a more generic video editing tool. Some options are Novacut and Blender, both of which should provide sufficient features to do what you need.\n", "Q: Should I put .htaccess rules in 000-default or httpd.conf?

They're not included because they're proprietary.\n", "Q: Can I install ONTO a flash drive? Okay, so I recently found out how to install the Xubuntu .iso onto a flash drive. I proceeded to do the live version from the flash drive. I wanted to actually install on the flash drive (where it would be a user and settings and stuff from the flash drive itself). I ended up installing next to Ubuntu... but then I got impatient and shut down, corrupting Ubuntu (I think) so I had to install Xubuntu over it... \nAnyway, I want to know if I can install onto the flash drive itself, so it has it's own filesystem files and all.\nIs that possible? Or will the live user function do all of that?\n\nA: A true (practical usable) ubuntu (that's not a live disk) install cannot be made on a flash drive (well it can but it's quite difficult to do properly and fully functional) You can however install ubuntu on an external hard drive (you can buy those for like 25 dollars because the capacity doesn't have to be that big).\nFirst thing you do (optional but it might save you the trouble of having to fix your windows disk if you make a mistake) is disconnect your internal hard drive (it's not that hard, just take out the cable).\nNext is just plain installing ubuntu on the external hard drive.\nReconnect your internal hard drive.\nChange your boot setting so the usb has boot priority and you're done\nNow I do have to note that unless you have usb 3.0 or e-sata it might run a little sluggish but not so much as to make it unusable. I've had some good results with a BM usb port in the past myself.\nIf you really want to use a flash drive I would just recommend to use a live version and keep about 500mb to a gig of \"usable\" space available. You can set this \"usable\" space using Unetbootin by simply increasing the space for user files.\nUnetbootin is available in the repositories and in the Ubuntu software center.\nTo install if from the Terminal use\nsudo apt-get install unetbootin\n\n", "Q: Headset jack not working even when using sound > test I have ubuntu 13.04 and the sound has never worked in this OS/version for the headset jack.

This happens to me every single time.\nThat means that you haven't actually installed GRUB to your hard disk, eventually ending up with no choice but windows every time you boot. You had to switch the destination to /dev/sda (which is your primary hard disk).\nNow, you can try re-installing Ubuntu and choose to install GRUB on /dev/sda, or repair GRUB by referring to the link that Avinash Raj mentioned in a comment on your question.\nEdit: Check this link too.

Could anyone tell me what is up with so many archives, and how are they differ?\nThere's at least five that I can think of, .tar.tz, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, .tar.lz, .tar.z\nWhich is best for what applications? It just seems silly to make so many variations of the same file but I'm sure there's a reason.\n\nA: In addition to the @Lekensteyn answer, I'd like to add that this behavior is based on Do one thing and do it well philosophy - tar program knows how to put multiple files into a single stream (with .tar extension), gzip knows how to compress a single file (adding .gz extension)*. By combining those tools you can create a command which compresses multiple files into a single .tag.gz file.\nThis approach is very flexible - you can combine a few standard Unix commands to do all sorts of things. For example, if you write a better program to compress files you don't need to modify tar to enable it to create .tar.mymegazip files - instead, you just pipe tar's output to your compressor.\nSimilarly, tar knows nothing about SSH, but by combining commands you can create a script which archives files, uploads them to a remote machine via SSH and un-archives them there.\nCompare this to zip command, which did not originate in Unix - it has built-in tools to compress whole directories, encrypt files, split the archive into smaller zipfiles etc. \n\n(footnote) - yes, tar is able to gzip or bzip files itself using -z and -j switches, they were added for convenience, and GNU tar is actually spawning gzip or bzip2 as a new process.\n\nA: The .gz, .xz, .bz2, .7z, .lz, .z suffixes are used to make clear that the file is compressed with said compression algorithm. Its use is not limited to .tar files, you will also see files such as initrd.gz (an compressed initial ramdisk) or manual.txt.gz (for a compressed text document). You may also see file.tgz which is also indicates a gzip-compressed tarball (like file.tar.gz).\nThe file extension is a convention, it does not necessarily describe the file contents. To check what kind of file you are handling, use the file command. Example:\n$ file data.tar.gz\ndata.tar.gz: gzip compressed data, from Unix\n$ gunzip -c data.tar.gz | file -\n/dev/stdin: POSIX tar archive (GNU)\n\nIn my experience, gzip-compressed files (.gz) are the most common ones. It is fast in compressing and decompressing, though there are other algorithms that yield better compression ratios.\n", "Q: Problems with touchpad in Cinnamon I've installed Cinnamon in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

Or do I need to install some program? If I don't, how do I use Ubuntu to read the file?\n\nA: Let's make it simple : No. Passwords are not meant to be decrypted, what would be the point ? No technique, no utility will allow you to do such a thing. Behind those passwords are huge algorithms meant to be one-way only.\nHowever, you can read the file (and see encrypted passwords) by doing :\nsudo cat /etc/shadow\n\nYou'll need to be a sudoer, or root himself (in which case, sudo is useless)\n\nA: here's the deal. You can't decrypt a hashed password, that would ruin the point of hashing. \nHashing works in basic terms, that you take a random string and mix that up (using a certain algorithm) with the password so that it becomes totally unreadable. Then you store this password + hash in a database. \nThen how do you know what the correct password is? Well you enter the password and take that same hash string and then you will get the same hash. Then simply compare those hashes and you know if the password is correct. \nYou can find out what password the user used, but then you need to know what hash string was used to hash it and also you need to know what hashing algorithm was used. Then in the end the solution is still to brute-force the password(try every combination) then hash it and see if it matches the hash that's stored in the database. So for a conclusion, you can \"decrypt\" a hashed password, but it's not easy. \nuseful links on the topic:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fundamental difference between Hashing and Encryption algorithms (stack overflow)\n\n*How NOT to Store Passwords! - Computerphile (youtube)\n\n*Hashing Algorithms and Security - Computerphile (youtube)\n\nA: Ubuntu can't decrypt passwords but you may find john useful: \nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jaunty/en/man8/john.8.html\n\nA: You need to install \"John the Ripper\".\n$ apt install john\n\nThen only 2 commands\n$ unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > mypasswd.txt \n$ john mypasswd.txt\n\nWhen it is finishes (in 1-5 min for password with 4 numbers), you'll see password you need.\n$ john --show mypasswd.txt\n\n\nA: In short - you can't!\n/etc/shadow stores a hashed version of the password. This is, for all intents and purposes, impossible to recover because hashing is a one way operation.\nThis stops malicious people being able to read the passwords of users on the system.\n\nA: Yes you can\nIf you want to decode this password then you need to install john the ripper in your ubuntu with sudo apt-get install john. you just need to copy line of that hash code and create a new file with .PASSWD extension and insert that file into john the ripper tool. It will automatically crack those hashes and give you the password of that particular user.\n\nA: Never assume a \"hashed\" password is always safe, not decryptable and uncrackable.\nIt all depends how the passwords has been \"hashed\" and what cryptographic algorithm was used, what techniques was used to hash a password and so on. There are dedicated hardware just to crack weak hashed passwords.\nMost common way to figure out a hashed password is to use brute force dictionary program to decrypt and figure out a hashed password. This by no means it always works but it is useful.\nYou'll be surprised how many people uses common easy to figure passwords and the brute force dictionary has tons of common passwords which are hashed and it compares it's value with the hashed password to find a match.\nBecause of this cryptographic developers came up with the \"salt\" and \"pepper\" hashing. Basically makes the common easy to guess passwords harder to crack since they will always be a unique hashed password.\nEnd of the day, yes hashed passwords can be cracked if it is weakly hashed.\nHere is a video on how to crack hashed passwords using \"Hashcat\":\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq097dEB8Sw\nMany factors comes to play when you want a hashed password uncrackable, making it extremely difficult to decrypt.\n", "Q: Accept Google Voice incoming calls with Empathy (or any other chat) on 13.04 I have tried How do I receive incoming Google Voice calls using Empathy? and How do I set up SIP voice calling in Empathy?, but nothing works on 13.04.\nI don't want to store my login information on another site, so this solution is out.\nHow can I accept incoming Google Voice phone calls with an Ubuntu app on 13.04?

Don't know what way, but it seems to be better.\nWhat's the advantage of macvtap over the second way?\nWhat's better?\nAny help on this?\n\nA: These methods are doing fundamentally different things.  To understand why, you need to understand the layered model of networking.  For our purposes here, layers 1, 2 and 3 are important:\n\n\n*\n\n*Layer 1 is the physical layer - this specifies things like what cables you can use, what voltage / current patterns represent 1s and 0s on that cable, how the devices at each end of a cable negotiate what bit rate they operate at and so on.\n\n*Layer 2 is the link layer - this specifies what language things at each end of a cable talk to each other.  Ethernet devices at this layer have things like frames and MAC addresses.\n\n*Layer 3 is the network layer - this specifies how devices use a direct layer 2 link to another device to reach a third device that they can't reach directly at layer 2.  Devices at this layer have IP addresses and routing tables.\n\n\nMACVLAN / MACVTAP\nMACVLAN creates a virtual layer 2 or link layer device, with its own MAC address, which shares the layer 1 or physical layer with an existing device.  The most obviously understandable case is where you have an Ethernet device plugged into a network and you create a MACVLAN device based on that Ethernet device; now you have two Ethernet \"devices\" with different MAC addresses but which both transmit their frames on the same cable.  I'll talk about MACVTAP a bit further down.\nMACVLAN interfaces can interact in several different ways with the existing Ethernet interface, in particular when a frame appears on one of the interfaces which is addresses to the other one:\n\n\n*\n\n*In private mode, the frame is thrown away; it is not possible for the two interfaces to communicate with each other, only with external devices.\n\n*In vepa mode, the frame is sent over the physical layer like any other frame.  If you have the device plugged into a switch that is clever enough to spot that the frame then needs to be send back down the same port it arrived on, then it will be received by the same physical layer that sent it and then layer 2 will use the MAC to send it to the intended network interface.\n\n*In bridge mode, when a frame appears on one device, it is checked to see if it is intended for the other and if so, it is sent there without going through layer 1.\n\n*There are also a couple of more obscure modes.\n\n\nNote that MACVLAN interfaces have an important restriction:  They're not capable of address learning.  So you can't bridge a MACVLAN interface to a second physical device and expect to be able to reach that second physical device over the first one.  This works with the original Ethernet interface but not with a MACVLAN interface attached to it.\nTUN/TAP\nA TAP interface is also a new virtual layer 2 device but with no layer 1 attached to it.  Instead, a program can get a file descriptor representing the physical layer.  It can then write raw Ethernet frame data into that file descriptor and the kernel will treat it like any other Ethernet packet it receives on a real physical interface.\nThe big thing about TAP interfaces is that the physical layer is in user mode; any bit of software with the appropriate permissions can generate Ethernet frames in any way it likes and shove them into something the kernel treats the same as a real physical interface.  This makes them very useful for things like VPNs and tunnelling; you can write whatever sort of tunnelling software you like in user space and there is no need to meddle in kernel space to get the frames into the networking stack, you just create a TAP device and write the frames into its file descriptor.\nTUN devices are just like TAP devices except they operate at layer 3 instead of layer 2 and the user mode software has to write raw IP packets into the file descriptor instead of raw Ethernet frames.\nGoing back to MACVTAP devices, these are sort of mix-up between MACVLAN and TAP interfaces.  Like TAP interfaces, a user-mode program can get a file descriptor and write raw Ethernet frames into it.  Like a MACVLAN interface, those frames are then sent over the physical layer of a real Ethernet device.  This allows you to easily adapt software that's written to use TAP devices to use a MACVLAN device instead.\nVNet\nThis is conceptually similar to TUN/TAP networking but has a more developed control plane (so the user-mode software using it can configure the interface more flexibly) and a more optimised data plane (so you can move data through the virtual network device more efficiently).\nAll of these do similar things but have slightly different capabilities.  All of them can be used to connect a VM to an Ethernet network:\n\n\n*\n\n*A virtualisation product can take Ethernet frames from the guest and write them into the file descriptor for a TAP device.  That TAP device can be assigned its own IP address by the host, or it can slaved to a bridge along with an Ethernet interface to share the host's IP address, or iptables can be configured to forward traffic on it using NAT.\n\n*A virtualisation product can that Ethernet frames from the guest and write them into the file descriptor for a MACVTAP device; these then get transmitted directly on an Ethernet device's physical layer, effectively giving the VM a \"real\" Ethernet device (though note that it is possible to create MACVLAN / MACVTAP devices for other types of network interfaces such as bridges).\n\n*A virtualisation product can connect a virtio driver in the guest to the virtio driver in the host for very efficient networking.\n\n\nA: It really depends what exactly you want to achieve\n\n\n*\n\n*TAP/ TUN\n\n\nDoesn't matter it's VM or physical machine. TUN brings you a tunneled network and TAP a device. In short, you go through a tunneled network to reach out another network.\nFor instance, when configuring an OpenVPN network, you'd be given 10.8.0.6 on your client. VPN server 10.8.0.1 routes your request to another network (eg 192.168.x.x) behind. When using TAP, you'd receive an IP (192.168.10.10/24) directly from your target network (192.168.10.x/24). Simple.\n\n\n*\n\n*Bridge\n\n\n\"Linux Bridge\" bridges VNET (from VM) to physical ethernet. If you want a VM (KVM based), bridge is a must between vnet and ethernet on host\n\nA: I'd say it depends on your use case. \nAutomated adds/deletes of virtual hosts? \nGive macvtap a try. Should also be performanter than macvlan (which is is roughly like adding another MAC to a physical device, infos arriving there are handled by the networking stack) or an additional bridge, as macvtap bypasses the network stack somehow and exports a tap character device directly. But don't nail me down on that. Besides both (macvlan/macvtap) share the same available modes (VEPA/hairpin, bridging, private), hairpinning only works if your switch supports reflective relay mode. (Packets arriving at the physical switch at port x must be allowed to leave the switch again on the same port x.)\nBecause the eth0 (or whichever one you use) is put into promiscuous mode when using a bridge, macvXXX modes are said to have higher throughputs.\nThe modes also define the 'amount' of isolation (can vhosts see each others traffic? how about the the hv?). How this works under the hood I do not yet know.\nveth's (virtual ethernet pairs) are somewhat similar for isolation, you define two virtual interfaces, one gets attached to a bridge, the other to your VM. There the isolation is done by putting the vm-interface into it's own namespace so the devices are somewhat isolated. All traffic comes together at the bridge, but one vhost cannot see another one's vNICs.\nIn case you work with a bridge, you have additional configuration to do, and when the bridge is down, so are all your connections. When bringing the bridge back up, you may have to reconnect all virtual interfaces to the bridge again (or just reboot the complete hv...). \nBottom line:\nIf you don't change your topology often, just go with bridging as you find the most information on it online, which is better than reading kernel code. Heck, even the iproute2-doc package itself lacks most of the information iproute2 actually has, even when you run bleeding-edge versions. Try finding out about man ip-tcp_metrics from the available manpages or ip-crefs.ps ...\n", "Q: How to build a computing cloud for scientific computing?

Thanks for your suggestions, though. \n\nA: If you've already installed ubuntu on your computer when you install xp on a (empty) partition you'll need to restore your grub (with an added boot line for xp).\nTo do this you'll need to create an empty partition where you want to install xp (since you do not want xp to install on top of you linux system, effectively wiping it). You can do this with partition magic. You can also do this with your program of choice but I just like partition magic because it's easy to use and quite save (you should still backup any data that cannot be lost just to be save). Please do keep in mind that if you re-size an partition with data that you do not make it smaller that the amount of data that's on the partition.\nNext you'll need to install xp onto this partition which shouldn't be to hard to do. Just make sure you select your partition of choice at the pre-install settings.\nAfter you've done that we're going to restore your grub since you can only boot xp at the moment.\nburn a boot-repair cd and boot it. Select \"recommended repair\" and wait for about a minute til it's done.\nReboot your pc. It should automatically boot into linux but you can select to boot your xp install. To customize your grub menu or change the choice delay you'll need grub customizer.\nThis approach always worked for me.\n\nA: I consider installing Windows XP in a virtual machine the best option.

I am sorry for my english, I am kinda frustrated.\n\nA: How exactly did you write the bootable USB? My guess is that your disk burner simply copied the files, there's a difference between just burning a USB and making it bootable (a bootloader needs to be written.) You might just need to try on another system and make sure that you use the program that Ubuntu recommends to write the startup disk (http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows), freedos is honestly not that useful.

I need this working I cant even access the grub bootloader to change options\n\nA: Two possible causes of your problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your Nvidia GeForce 6150 SE nForce 430 graphics card is going bad. This would explain why everything related to graphics is causing your system to freeze. A bad graphics card is a common cause of this problem.\n\n*You don't have the minimum system requirements necessary for installing Ubuntu 12.04. This is less likely in my opinion, because Ubuntu 12.04 only requires 384MB RAM. However the Nvidia GeForce 6150 SE nForce 430 graphics card shares up to 256MB of your system RAM, so that would increase your minimum system requirement for RAM up to 640MB. If that is your problem, then you would need to install a more lightweight *buntu version such as Lubuntu 13.10, which somewhat resembles Windows XP in look and feel. \n\nA: I suspect this can also be a memory problem.

Can I erase it? \nI'm new in this Linux stuff, and I suppose that I am asking for information about a Windows specific file (which is kind of ironical thing to ask on a Linux-oriented website), but, in my old \"Windows times\" I don't remember to deal with such a file. Anyway, even if it is somewhere in my system, at least, it wasn't appearing on my desktop by itself.\nAnyhow, giving the fact that now I try to run on my OS the software specific to other OS, I can't know what I can keep and what I can erase, and how to manage things in a good way. It is already enough that some of the Windows programs simply don't run properly under Linux, I don't wont to make things any worse. \n\nA: A .lnk file is just a link to the actual program, just like those shortcuts that clutter your desktop in Windows. Yes you can safely remove those located on your desktop, the program will still be installed. \n", "Q: can i again reinstall java on ubuntu?because both windows and ubuntu is in my system and java is configured on windows? iam new to ubuntu. i have been working on windows. My question is can we run web application developed in windows on ubuntu? both windows and ubuntu is installed in my system java is congigured on windows. Shall i again re instal java  mysql and tomcat on ubuntu? please help. Thanks in advance\n\nA: While Java is made such that a Java application can run across different operating systems without changing the code and recompiling it. It is (for example) somewhat easy to introduce Windows specific things and thus preventing it to run on Linux or Mac.\nOf course you will need to install everything that your java application needs again on the Linux side. Alternatively you could also setup a MySql-Server on a different computer and make it accessible from both Windows and Linux side.\n", "Q: `sudo apt-get update` lock error on a fresh 12.04 install ( different angle ) My question(s) are related to the sequence of the following actions:\ni) I performed a fresh installation of 12.04 on a machine\nii) After the installation was complete and the media ( optical disk ) were removed ( as per the prompt ), I rebooted the machine and logged in into the brand-new system.\niii) I opened a terminal and tried to do an update of APT's cache ( sudo apt-get update ). This results in apt-get reporting an error due to some conflict it detects ( indicated by the /var/lib/apt/lists/lock file being locked by some other application )\nThis question ( or related questions ) seems to have been asked several times and one ( plausible ) post explains the error as having been caused by some updating software such as Software Center or Synaptic already running.\n\n*\n\n*Is this systematic ( i.e. part of the installation process )?\n\n\n*Is the system trying to run Synaptic after a fresh installation ( ... perhaps as some automated post-installation sequence which runs on initial log-in )?\n\n\n*Did I get the lock error for apt-get update because I was inadvertently interfering with another instance of apt-get or similar which gets started immediately after the first log in of a user after a fresh installation?\nIn short I would like to understand why this happened, because as outlined above, after the installation and my firs log-in, I did not launch or start any apps. >other< than the terminal (....from previous experience with the Synaptic package I knew that if you intend to use apt-get you must make sure Synaptic is not running..).\nNote:\nYou only seem to get this when you try to run sudo apt-get from one of the pseudo terminals within the X windowing system. You don't get the lock error if you use one of the virtual terminals ( the character based ones you get by doing 'Ctrl+Alt+F(1-6)').\nExact error messages ( added at request from one of the commenters @Sushantp606 ):\nE: Could not get lock /var/lib/apt/lists/lock -open ( 11: Resource temporarily unavailable )\nE: Unable to lock directory /var/lib/apt/lists/\n\n\nA: First of all synaptic is not installed by default in Ubuntu 12.04 unless you installed it manually. Most probably the problem is causing  by software center. It may happen that when you are trying to update apt-cache, the software center is also trying the same. That is causing the error. To be sure you can open software center and on top right (last icon) you might get an busy or 'progress' icon.\n\nThen wait for software center to finish its action. Then try apt-get update. I am not sure if software center center can work or not from virtual console. If Software center can work from VC the process might be over already that is why you did not get any error.\n", "Q: Installing ndiswrapper-dkms on ubuntu 12.04 Every time I try to install ndiswrapper-dkms, I get a crash report saying,\nTitle: \"ndiswrapper-dkms 1.57-1ubuntu1: ndiswrapper kernel module failed to build\"\nDKMSBuildLog: \"DKMS make.log for ndiswrapper-1.57 for kernel 3.8.0-33-generic (x86_64)\n -date and time-\nCannot find kernel build files in \n\n/usr/src/linux-headers-3.8.0-33-generic\n\nPlease give the path to kernel build directory with\nthe KBUILD= argument to make\nmake:[config_check] Error 1\n\nA: Not sure if this problem has been resolved yet.

Therefore I'd like to understand more about any involved limitations, constraints and necessities. \nIn particular I'd like to understand if the same physical cluster can host multiple Juju environments, assuming openstack/virtualization is not used\nThank you\n\nA: Massimo, yes, with recent MAAS and Juju packages, you can have multiple different Juju environments running using one MAAS controller.\nWhen a Juju MAAS environment is bootstrapped, it gets an \"agent-name\", which is a created UUID.  This is then used to discriminate between different Juju environments, so a single user can have multiple non-overlapping Juju environments that don't accidentally step on each other's toes. \n\nA: I am not the right person to answer your question but I quickly asked around and by default MaaS supports one Juju environment and via manual providers you could run multiple in a more manual fashion.\nI am interested in understanding your use case to see if support for multiple Juju environments for MaaS should go into our roadmap.\nPlease contact me at maarten dot ectors at canonical dot com.\nregards,\nMaarten\n", "Q: Active Directory / Map Network Drive / Likewise-open The Situation:\nWindows Active Directory with a Domain, Users have specific private Network Drives automatically mapped onto their machine, when they log in on a windows machine.\nI want to achieve the same with the Ubuntu Desktops. \nHow to do that?\nAnother Problem is that the home directories arent private.

The manual is rubbish. I had assumed +5 was what we wanted but a comment disagreed. The documentation appears to conflict so I started by creating three files, each 1 day apart:\n$ mkdir test\n$ touch test/now\n$ touch -d \"1 day ago\" test/yesterday\n$ touch -d \"2 days ago\" test/day-before-yesterday\n$ ls -l test\ntotal 0\n-rw-r--r-- 1 oli oli 0 Nov 26 13:12 day-before-yesterday\n-rw-r--r-- 1 oli oli 0 Nov 28 13:11 now\n-rw-r--r-- 1 oli oli 0 Nov 27 13:12 yesterday\n\nIf we want something that is between 24-48 hours old exactly, we use 1 without a sign.\n$ find test -mtime 1\ntest/yesterday\n\nBut if we want things 24hours +, +1 doesn't work:\n$ find test -mtime +1\ntest/day-before-yesterday\n\n+1 seems to mean \"more than what 1 shows\"...

What is the Bash command I can use to convert an upper-case string to lower-case and vice-versa?\nThank you.\n\nA: If the string is already stored in a variable you can use bash's parameter expansion, specifially ${parameter,,pattern} (available since bash 4.0), where parameter is the name of your variable and pattern is ommitted:\n$ string=\"Hello, World!\"\n$ echo $string\nHello, World!\n$ echo ${string,,}\nhello, world!\n\nNote that this does not change the value of the variable, only the output. To change the variable you have to assign the new value:\n$ echo $string\nHello, World!\n$ string=${string,,}\n$ echo $string\nhello, world!\n\nThe upper-case conversion works with ${parameter^^pattern}:\n$ echo ${string^^}\nHELLO, WORLD!\n\nThis works also with Unicode strings (at least with current bash versions, probably needs at least bash 4.3):\n$ string='ἈΛΦΆβητος'\n$ echo ${string,,}\nἀλφάβητος\n$ echo ${string^^}\nἈΛΦΆΒΗΤΟΣ\n\n\nIf you are using zsh, you can use Parameter Expansion Flags (${(FLAGS)NAME}; available since zsh 2.5) to achieve the same results. The bash syntax does not work in zsh 1). The flag for lower case is L; for upper case it is U:\n$ string=\"Hello, World!\"\n$ echo ${(L)string}\nhello, world!\n$ echo ${(U)string}\nHELLO, WORLD!\n$ echo $string\nHello, World!\"\n\nThis also works with Unicode strings (at least since zsh 5.0; I did not try with earlier versions):\n$ string='ἈΛΦΆβητος'\n$ echo ${(L)string} \nἀλφάβητος\n$ echo ${(U)string}  \nἈΛΦΆΒΗΤΟΣ\n\n\n1) Although, seeing that zsh had this for far longer, it should probably be: \"the zsh syntax does not work in bash.\n\nA: There are very few methods that work correctly with Unicode:\nGNU sed 4.2.2 works:\n$ echo \"Idą gęsi łąką\" | sed 's/.*/\\U&/'\nIDĄ GĘSI ŁĄKĄ\n\n\nbash 4.2.45 declare does not work:\n$ typeset -u ucase; ucase=\"Idą gęsi łąką\"; echo $ucase\nIDą GęSI łąKą\n\nbash 4.2.45 parameter expansion does not work:\n$ str=\"Idą gęsi łąką\"; echo ${str^^}\nIDą GęSI łąKą\n\nbash 4.3.42 declare and parameter expansion work:\n$ declare -u ucase\n$ ucase=\"Idą gęsi łąką\"\n$ echo $ucase\nIDĄ GĘSI ŁĄKĄ\n$ echo ${ucase,,}\nidą gęsi łąką\n\n\nGNU tr 8.20 does not work:\n$ echo \"Idą gęsi łąką\" | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'\nIDą GęSI łąKą\n\n\nmawk (default awk in Ubuntu 13.10) does not work:\n$ echo \"Idą gęsi łąką\" | mawk '{print toupper($0)}'\nIDą GęSI łąKą\n\n\ngawk works:\n$ echo \"Idą gęsi łąką\" | gawk '{print toupper($0)}'\nIDĄ GĘSI ŁĄKĄ\n\n\nPerl pure uc() does not work:\n$ echo \"Idą gęsi łąką\" | perl -ne 'print uc($_);'\nIDą GęSI łąKą\n\n\nPython 2 without any Unicode hints does not work:\n$ echo \"Idą gęsi łąką\" | python -c 'import sys; print sys.stdin.read().upper(),'\nIDą GęSI łąKą\n\nPython 2 when instructed to deal with Unicode works:\n$ echo \"Idą gęsi łąką\" | python -c 'import sys; print sys.stdin.read().decode(\"utf-8\").upper(),'\nIDĄ GĘSI ŁĄKĄ\n\n\nPython 3 works:\n$ echo \"Idą gęsi łąką\" | python3 -c 'import sys; print(sys.stdin.read().upper(), end=\"\")'\nIDĄ GĘSI ŁĄKĄ\n\n\nA: I would use the bash internal typeset or declare command to define a lowercase variable.\n$ typeset -l lcase\n$ lcase=\"LoWeR cAsE\"\n$ echo $lcase\nlower case\n\nThe chars are lowered when the value is set, not when you typeset the variable. So it is better to typeset at the beginning of the script. For uppercase you can typeset -u.\n$ typeset -u ucase\n$ ucase=\"Upper cAsE\"\n$ echo $ucase\nUPPER CASE\n\nThis is not specific to bash shell, that works also on ksh, maybe its in POSIX shell definition.\nEDIT: \nMany people gently pointed me the fact that typeset is now considered obsolete on bash and replaced by declare. Both commands are equivalent.\n$ help typeset\ntypeset: typeset [-aAfFgilrtux] [-p] name[=value] ...\n    Set variable values and attributes.\n\n    Obsolete.

(e.g. allow numbers and letters but disable F1, Esc, touchpad, click events, etc). I have read How to disable keys from the keyboard?, but that does not discuss everything. I am wondering if there is a pre-existing solution so that I do not need to work through all of those details myself.\nI would like to be able to press a \"secret set of keys\" and then switch between \"safe\" keyboard mode and \"normal\" keyboard mode. I would like to do this so that I can use my keyboard, then my child may type on the keyboard, and then I can continue using the keyboard.\nI am using Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS\n$ uname --kernel-release --kernel-version --machine\n3.2.0-56-generic #86-Ubuntu SMP Wed Oct 23 09:20:45 UTC 2013 x86_64\n\n\nA: Afraid there isn't a pre-existing solution.\nFor the \"secret key combination\", see [gnome icon] → Control Center → Key Combinations.  Really, anything with a control-key+letter will probably be safe from a toddler.\nFor disabling keys, xmodmap is probably your best bet.  Here's how to set F1..F3 to print period or the corresponding number depending on the \"shift\" state...\nxmodmap <<EOX -\nkeycode 67 = period 1\nkeycode 68 = period 2\nkeycode 69 = period 3\nEOX\n\n(that way they do \"something\", just nothing funny).\nAnd this is fine for \"small child comes along, wants to play with keyboard\".  As they get older, they'll need their own account.\n\nA: The touchpad is easy to disable.  In system settings under \"Mouse and Touchpad\" under the Touchpad tab just disable it.  For the keyboard there may be a way to do what you want in software, but I've never seen or heard of it.  The trouble you're going to have is with the \"secret code\" to re-enable things.  The only way I can think of to re-enable the keys is with the command prompt, which you don't want to expose to the toddler.\nI think a hardware approach might work better.  They sell keyboards without function keys just for kids.  For example:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/DURAGADGET-Colourful-Childrens-Special-Keyboard/dp/B005GL0PXK\nIt does still have the \"esc\" key.  So if you wanted to avoid that you may have to physically remove the key.  But I suppose if you're asking about a laptop (I'm assuming since you mention a touchpad) that becomes a bit difficult because you can't really remove the keyboard it comes with.\nHave you seen the OLPC?  http://one.laptop.org/\nThey make very sturdy tablets and laptops for kids.  You can find them on ebay for relatively cheap.  Alternatively just create an account with very limited rights and if they mess it up just delete and recreate the account.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 64bit non-apt program needs 32bit functionality how? What happened to the ia32-libs package?\nSo I've been reading through several answers about the ia32-libs package being no longer supported, which is cool. However, I have a somewhat unique circumstance. On my workstation at work, I'm running Ubuntu 13.10 on an AMD64, and I need to run Liveperson, which requires Java 6, and 32-bitness. It's also not available through apt, and has to be installed independently.\nWhile I was running 12.04, there were ways to still get the ia32-libs package, which was necessary. Is there a way to make this work on 13.10?\n\nA: ia32-libs has been removed completely. The way to install i386 libraries now is one at a time as you need them. This isn't a problem for applications from the repo since it will just automatically install what you need, but installing from a .deb is problematic.\nThis will cover the method to discover and install the dependencies you need: How do you run a 32-bit program on a 64-bit version of Ubuntu?\n\nA: I ran into a similar issue when trying to install 32-bit Matlab (which is also non-apt and Java based) on a machine running 13.10 64-bit (see question here). \nTry installing Liveperson as you have done in the past except without installing ia32-libs. Hopefully if there are unmet dependencies it will complain about some library not found. Next, search for this library in Ubuntu's packages for your release (in this case saucy). Make sure to search the contents of the packages. After you find the package name, install it: (make sure to include the trailing :i386)\nsudo apt-get install <package-name>:i386\n\nNext, try to install Liveperson again. Repeat this process until all dependencies are met.\nAs an example: I am using the Student version of Matlab 2011a and the required packages for me on Ubuntu 13.10 are:\nsudo apt-get install libxtst6:i386 libXext6:i386 libxi6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libxt6:i386 libxpm4:i386 libxmu6:i386 libxp6:i386\n\n", "Q: How to setup domain on my home webserver?

I needed to detect read access to certain files so I needed the file system to update the atime attribute of files the usual way.\nDefault mount options\nIn the default state the file system did not update atime as expected though I did not use the noatime option:\n$ cat /etc/fstab | grep '/home '\n# /home was on /dev/sda7 during installation\nUUID=d7e67903-f24d-45a7-be90-6a134c9c1ae9 /home         ext4    defaults      0     2\n\n$ mount | grep '/home '\n/dev/sda7 on /home type ext4 (rw)\n\n$ cat /etc/mtab | grep '/home '\n/dev/sda7 /home ext4 rw 0 0\n\nThe atime on a file was updated only sometimes. Later I realized that the file system is mounted with the new relatime option.\n$ cat /proc/mounts | grep '/home '\n/dev/sda7 /home ext4 rw,relatime,user_xattr,barrier=1,data=ordered 0 0\n\nThe obvious solution does not work\nSo it seems that the relatime option is the default on Ubuntu 12.04. The solution seemed to be easy - explicitly state the non-default atime option:\n$ sudo mount -o remount,atime /home\n\nI was suprised that the actual mount options looked exactly the same like without the atime option.\n$ mount | grep '/home '\n/dev/sda7 on /home type ext4 (rw)\n\n$ cat /etc/mtab | grep '/home '\n/dev/sda7 /home ext4 rw 0 0\n\n$ cat /proc/mounts | grep '/home '\n/dev/sda7 /home ext4 rw,relatime,user_xattr,barrier=1,data=ordered 0 0\n\nIn fact the system was behaving exactly the same as without the atime option.\nQuestions\nWhat is going on? Why cannot I simply use the atime option? What can I do to get the normal atime functionality?\n\nA: In fact there are four five atime-related options of mount in Linux:\n\n\n*\n\n*noatime - atime attribute (of both files and directories) is updated only during write access.\n\n*nodiratime - atime of directories is updated only during write access, can be combined with relatime.\n\n*relatime / atime - atime seems to be now alias of relatime. This option causes the atime attribute to update only if the previous atime is older than mtime or ctime, or the previous atime is over 24 hours old.\n\n*strictatime - It was formerly called atime and as such was the default option. It causes the atime attribute to update with every file access. (accessing file data, not just the metadata/attributes)\n\n*lazytime - Linux 4.10 added a new option: only update times (atime, mtime, ctime) on the in-memory version of the file inode. The on-disk data is updated lazily (see man 8 mount for details).\n\n\nSince Linux kernel 2.6.30 the default option is relatime. If you want to have the original atime functionality you must use the strictatime option. In the presented case it would be:\nsudo mount -o remount,strictatime /home\n\nSources\n\n\n*\n\n*stat() - atime problems solutions\n\n*/etc/fstab - common options to all file systems\n\n*Once upon a time\n", "Q: How change a mention about user folder after user name changing correctly colleagues.\nI renamed my username from test to drobazko.\nAlso I renamed a user folder from /home/test to /home/drobazko.\nI am developing under Ruby rvm.\nAnd I found out that the /home/test/ path was mentioned in many files.\nHow Can I replace this line in files correctly.  \n\nA: You can use the \"sed\" command to replace all occurrences of \"foo\" in a file with \"bar\" using the following syntax:\nsed -i 's/foo/bar/g' filename\n\nIn your case it would be\nsed -i 's/\\/home\\/test/\\/home\\/drobazko/g' filename\n\n\"filename\" here can be a wildcard * or matching certain types of files (eg *.rb)\n", "Q: How to upgrade several versions at once? So today I decided to upgrade from Ubuntu 12.04 all the way to 13.10, as my laptop has the recommended specs.  I upgraded from 12.04 to 12.10 just fine, but when I upgraded to 13.04, it was 1:50 AM, and I left it running overnight so I could catch some Z's.\nWhen I checked on it this morning, it said that a bunch of errors had occurred, and so I just clicked close.  Then it said it finished the upgrade with some errors, and so I restarted my laptop.  When it booted, it brought me to the system recovery screen, and I did everything available to fix the problems there.\nI then restarted my laptop again, but when it booted, it was just a black screen, then became a terminal and nothing more.  I've now erased 13.04 and 12.10 and put 12.04 back on my laptop.  Any ideas/suggestions?\nI used the update manager to upgrade distros.  Does that have anything to do with it?\n\nA: Since you have already erased the operating system, then do a fresh install of the desired Ubuntu version. I have seen Ubuntu fail to upgrade a few times. It is probably some unknown bug.  Ubuntu 13.04 (Raring) is a reliable version, so a fresh install should work well.\n", "Q: Why is my notebook going to sleep when lid is closed even If I disabled it?

The reason was some broken dependencies. In my case it was Java package so I removed it and then reinstalled after running tasksel. \nA one way to find broken dependency is to try to run apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop^ and see whether it will complain about unsatisfied dependencies or just list packages to remove. Make sure to select No and don't actually remove any packages with this command. It may ruin your system\n\nA: I am running 14.04. I've got this error, then I installed default-jre and then I could remove ubuntu-desktop by tasksel.\n", "Q: What's the difference between LPR and cupswrapper drivers? How to install printer drivers? I'm considering getting a Brother HL2230 printer. I can't find that printer listed in https://www.openprinting.org/printers\nHowever there're a few HL2230 Linux drivers available in http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_prn.html#HL-2230\nWhat's the difference between LPR driver and cupswrapper driver? Which one should I use for Ubuntu?\nAnd once I download the driver how to I install it?\nThanks\n\nA: LPR is part of the cups-client package - it provides interfaces that allow printing via command line and apparently over the network. It appears the lpr packages provides needed information and utilities, while the cupswrapper packages provide a wrapper for configuring cups (and depend on files from the LPR package being installed).\nMost printers should be automatically configured when you plug in the USB as long as CUPS is installed (it looks for information on the printer, such as a PPD file, so it knows how to work with the printer), so you shouldn't need to install third party packages (see N.B.)\nOtherwise, you will likely need to install BOTH packages - download the DEB files and install them, either by opening the downloaded files or using the command line - install the LPR file first:\nsudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/hl2230lpr-2.1.0-1.i386.deb\nsudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/cupswrapperHL2230-2.0.4-2.i386.deb\n\n(where ~/Downloads/* is the path to the deb packages in the Downloads folder - you can also use gdebi instead of dpkg -i)\nIt is also mentioned here that using the driver info for the HL-2170W seems to work (from foomatic - you can install the foomatic packages using the package manager so you don't have to download the files from a website).\nThe manufacturer's instructions are available here. Similar instructions can be found here, as well as the recommendation to use a tool provided by Brother. \nN.B: With some third party packages (not from the ubuntu repositories which you use with apt-get), they may not be well maintained and may use weird packaging methods - e.g. the provided packages appear to be converted using alien from a Redhat/Fedora RPM file, and do not specify dependcies such as bash, the LPR package, etc -->\n", "Q: Things to keep in mind to change after cloning a Ubuntu server vm I have a Ubuntu 12.04 server running on an vmware workstation 8.\nDue to my time limitations I can not afford to install new servers so I decided that I must  make 10 clones of it with the exact same configuration.\nWhat must I keep in mind to change besides the IP address, mac address and the hostname so that I don't cause any conflicts between the servers after that?\n\nA: And if it is Ubuntu 18.04 using DHCP and netplan (or you may want to do it anyway), just spent a while trying to figure our why my clone with different MAC addresses got the same ip from a dhcp server...\nYou have to change /etc/machine-id to give it a unique name by using \nsudo systemd-machine-id-setup\n\n\nA: If you're making 10 clones of an existing server you're still in the trade-off where spending a few hours now, deconstructing its setup and scripting it with Puppet/Chef/Juju/etc and setting up maintenance and monitoring is easily going to offset the time you would spend manually chasing around after servers running individual package updates and wondering what went wrong when a service drops off.\nIt's really boring sysop stuff... But as I say, it'll pay for itself within a couple of months and by the end of next year you'll either be thanking me for suggesting it or cursing yourself for ignoring it. IMO that applies when you're dealing with any more than two computers. It doesn't take that long to get this stuff set up.\nBut IP address and hostnames are the big two. If you're running network-provisioning services like a DHCP, that's going to cause issues but assuming these are clients, you're probably not going to see any more problems immediately.\n\nA: Yikes, yes IP addresses and hostnames are obvious.  However, please be sure you delete /root/.ssh so those VMs don't have your SSH keys to get back into your main server.   Same thing if you create that main server VM as your personal server -- remote user accounts that don't need to be on the server.   \nSince time is important, is space important?  How about a new server,. give student logins to it and have them SSH to their own lightweight container where they can't affect your server.  See man -k lxc.   FYI, Docker was started using a simple linux container tool called \"lxc\".\n(1) create brand new Ubuntu or CentOS server; and (2) use Linux Container (lxc \"lxc create {servername} -t ubuntu\" on your Ubuntu VM.  It will let you easily create 10 containers that can be logged into.\n\"Oli\" raised good point about scripting.  See many of the tutorials on digital ocean on using Ansible to create a LXC lab with web servers and database servers.  They have both Apache and Nginx versions of the tutorials if you need web server.\nGood luck!\nLarry\n", "Q: Lubuntu ignores sleep mode prefrence I may be posting in the wrong forums, since this is a Lubuntu question.

It's not the first time I dual boot Ubuntu and Windows but this time, during the installation, when I get to where you'r supposed to pick the disk and partition where to install Ubuntu it doesn't show me the option for installing it alongside my Windows 7 Ultimate N x64 (the N version is the stripped down version of windows) and when I tried creating the partition myself and fix GRUB using boot-repair it just did not start anymore in any of the OSs. Can someone help me? Thanks!!! \nEDIT: I think the problem might be that the \"new\" (it's acctually 1 year old, only that I didn't do dual boot on this one yet) motherboard I installed uses UEFI for booting windows. I'll give a try with the guides regarding that.\n\nA: Try to recreate the bootloader of Windows 7 to login first. To do this, you will need a pendrive with a formatted ISO of Windows 7 x64 N (min 4GB) and Rufus Bootable USB program. You can download this for free from the internet. And also EasyBCD to create Windows boot loader with Grub emulated bootloader to boot your Ubuntu OS. This is steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a Windows 7 pendrive or prepare your Windows 7 installation DVD\n\n*When Windows 7 setup screen is displayed, select repair computer, and select from other menu windows cmd\n\n*Write this command - bootrec /fixmbr and /rebuildbcd\n\n*Now you should can login to your Windows system\n\n*Install EasyBCD program\n\n*Create new boot option with Grub emulator\n\n*Restart your computer, and select grub, when your Linux system \n\n\nI hope that I could help you :)\n\nA: It seams that after fiddling around a bit I managed to get the dual boot working! \nHow I did it:\n\n\n*\n\n*Did a fresh install of Windows 7 N x64 on the entire drive.\n\n*Once the installation was finished I went into windows disk management by right clicking on the my computer icon on my desktop and selecting manage from the drop-down menu. On the right of the window that opens you'll find the disk management.\n\n*In disk management I shrieked the partition to the size I needed for my ubuntu installation (you can skip this if you are smarter than me and create a smaller partition for windows while installing it).\n\n*Rebooted my system and made sure that I booted off my CD/DVD/BD/USB drive (I use an external DVD drive) in UEFI mode (on my boot menu it says: UEFI:CD/DVD drive). You did it right if you get to this screen (http://i.stack.imgur.com/6guvi.png) instead of this one (http://i.stack.imgur.com/AM2WE.png)\n\n*Picked install ubuntu and got to the part where it asks you if you want to erase the entire disk, install along side windows (this time missing) or other more advanced stuff. \n\n*Select the other more advanced stuff and there you have to create your linux partitions on the space we freed up earlier. I personally created the following 3 partition: \n\n\n*\n\n*1x 500MB /boot partition in ext4.\n\n*1x 30GB (more or less) / partition in ext4 (even if 20GB was more than enough).\n\n*1x 4GB swap area partition.\n\n*If you want your home files to be on a separate partition you can create a /home ext4 partition.\n\n\n*Waited for the installation to finish and when the system rebooted I went into my boot menu again and chose to boot from Ubuntu (now I have a Ubuntu entry and a Windows Boot Manager entry in my boot manager menu, I chose to put ubuntu as the primary boot option and manage on which os to boot on first from GRUB) that loaded the good old GRUB with the options of booting to Ubunu 13.10 and Windows 7 N.\nThis was my experience with an ASrock A75M motherboard, I tried to be as general as possible so that it can be used as a guideline for anyone with UEFI dual boot problems.

How can I fix this error and install Ubuntu?\n\nA: I had a very similar problem on my computer (same model).  It seemed like it was a problem with setting up the partions because after that error, when I would restart the installation the root and swap partitions did not show up as ext4 and swap.  I dropped to the live USB, ran GPARTED and created these two partitions for myself.

I recently installed Ubuntu 13.10(The latest version) onto my laptop from a USB. Now, I want to completely erase Ubuntu 13.10 and go back to Windows 8.

This can be dangerous so take it slow and double check everything. Triple check actually because this will delete everything on your usb key and it can delete everything on your computer if you mess this up.\nFirst run:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nThis will show you the devices that are plugged into your computer. You want to find the name of the usb key you want to format. It will probably be sdb, BUT IT MAY NOT. Look for a device with two partitions and with the size of your usb key.\nNext run:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdx\n\nreplace x with the letter of the usb key from the last command. We don't care about the numbers following that letter. Make sure you get this part right; otherwise you may kill your computer!\nThis will make your usb key all zero. This command will take some time to run.\nNow use Gparted and format it to whatever you want. If it gives any error just click through it and try again until it does it.\n\nA: This might be a controversial suggestion, but if all else fails I'd try formatting the USB using a Windows PC! I'm no Ubuntu expert, but I've had problems using GParted and other tools to format a USB stick after messing up the files on it. However, Windows always seems to somehow get the drive back to plain FAT32. Don't ask me why, it's just my personal experience. \nPlease bear in mind that this could very well be my limited knowledge of all the options GParted has to offer, rather than Windows doing a better job!\n", "Q: Recover Orphaned RAID 0 from Silicon Image controller with Linux Software RAID? I had an old XP machine in Raid0, 2 x 120gb drives on a Sil3112 controller. The drives are intact (afaik) but the motherboard or P4 is toast.\nId love to recover precious photos from the drive or dump its entire contents onto an external. I am beginning to understand that Ubuntu might be able to rebuild the array on a modern system so I can recover data using the liveCD. Is this correct?\nIf so do I need a machine with existing Raid ports/controllers etc or do I just need a board with regular sata connections. Many thanks in advance for any assistance in this topic.\n\nA: Had pretty much the same problem with an it8212 \"fake RAID\" controller, and a couple of disks on RAID0. Surprisingly, mdadm could solve the problem, with a little trial and error, though.\nIf you know/remember the chunksize (the quantum of each parallel disk read/write for each disk), you can try something like that (don't try it just yet):\n sudo mdadm --build --verbose --run --chunk=64 /dev/md0 --level=raid0 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sde /dev/sdd\n\nIf /dev/md0 was already occupied, feel free to use incremental numbers instead of 0.\nOf course, /dev/sde and /dev/sdd where the disks in my case, and 64k was my chunksize, but you can easily determine your own configuration with:\n    sudo fdisk -l\nThis lists all partitions of all your physical discs. Those two that interest us should be exactly identical in manner of size, cylinders, sectors, etc.\nFurthermore, since parameter ordering definitely matters, the first one (in place of my /dev/sde) should appear to have a partition table (or a part of it, if you had used extended dos partitions), and the second one (my /dev/sdd) would appear to be totally corrupt.  Be careful not to touch your other, non-raid disks, though :-)\nOTAH, if both appear invalid, you can stop reading this answer, it wont work for you :-(\nUsing --build (instead of --create) has the advantage of skipping the creation of superblock information, avoiding risk of data erase, and, most importantly, starting real data from sector 0, thus creating a so called \"legacy\" assembly, which is what most \"fake raid\" chipset vendors would do.(educated guess: their superblock info is written on chipset NV memory, therefore they don't really need to write any metadata on the disks).\nNow, if you don't remember the original chunk size, trial and error is required...\nTry building with a different chunk size each time, then use fdisk -l on /dev/md0 explicitly, and see if partition info is displayed correctly. \nIf so, try mounting one of the discovered partitions as read-only and verify some data (preferably text), in order to be sure. If not, undo.\nTo undo mdadm building, and make disk available again, use \n    sudo mdadm --stop /dev/md0\n     and\n    sudo mdadm --remove /dev/md0\nThen try again, with different chunk size.\nAlthough mounting would suffice (ability to mount corrupt partitions is extremely rare), here's a somewhat more advanced trick to check correct chunk size, by searching for partition identifier string.\nHopefully, in a valid partition table, the starting sectors of one or more recognizable partitions are described. Again, in my case:\n /dev/sde1   *          63    47118644    23559291    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n /dev/sde2        47118645   102896324    27888840    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n /dev/sde4       102896325   980463014   438783345    5  Extended\n\nIn almost every case, you can find identifier strings close to the beginning of every type of partition. ie. 'NTFS' itself, in case of NTFS.\nUsing dd, copy the first few sectors of the disk (/dev/md0), onto a file.\n sudo dd if=/dev/md0 of=testfile bs=1024 count=256 skip=0\n\nThis should copy the first (skip=0) 256K of disk data to 'testfile'. Now, using something like:\nstrings -a -t d testfile | grep NTFS\n\nor x instead of d if you prefer hex, or, more simply,\nhexdump -C testfile | less\n\nthen, search with '/'\nand you can find the position of the string in the entire disk.\nCompare that with the calculated partition offset. \nFor example, in my case, the first ntfs partition started at 63th sector, which leads to an offset of 63*512 = 32256. 'NTFS' string was found at place 32259, so we'd consider this 'a match' (3 bytes post the beginning). (Don't forget to add skip * bs to your calculation, if some non-zero skip is used in dd). Unfortunately, a match doesn't necessarily mean it's the correct chunk size, while a mismatch would mean it surely isn't. \n\nA: As far a I know, you can't do that with mdadm/Linux Software RAID since the only foreign metadata formats it supports are Intel(R) Matrix Storage Manager and DDF.\nYou have to get a exact or similar motherboard or a controller with the same chip (and probably firmware) and be extremely cautious when \"importing\" the drives or otherwise your data is lost.\nI've been there long time ago with Silicon Image chips and realized how bad this solution is (you should always have an exact spare controller ready in case something bad happens).\nFake RAID support\nThe articles on dmraid/Fake RAID from the Ubuntu Community Documentation and the Arch Linux Wiki might be of help to you.\nLinux Software RAID vs Fake RAID\nExcerpt from the Linux Raid Wiki on fake RAID:\n\nProper hardware RAID systems are presented to linux as a block device [...]\nBIOS / firmware RAID aka fake raid cards:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*[...]\n  \n*if the 'raid' card or motherboard dies then you often have to find an exact replacement and this can be tricky for older cards\n  \n*if drives move to other machines the data can't easily be read\n  \n*there is usually no monitoring or reporting on the array - if a problem occurs then it may not show up unless the machine is rebooted\n  and someone is actually watching the BIOS boot screen (or until multiple errors occur and your data is lost)\n  \n*you are entrusting your data to unpatchable software written into a BIOS that has probably not been tested, has no support mechanism and\n  almost no community.\n  \n*[...]\n  \n  \n  Given the point of RAID is usually to reduce risk it is fair to say\n  that using fakeraid is a terrible idea and it's better to focus energy\n  on either true HW raid or in-kernel SW raid [...]\n\n", "Q: Using Ubuntu desktop as Upnp DMC (Digital Media Controler) I've just tested Rygel, but as I understand, Rygel is a server.\nWhat I am looking for, is to choose the music on my computer (using Rhythmbox for example) and the file (or the stream ?) is send via upnp to a network player (Pioneer N-50 from my side).\nThen the \"sound\" is played by the network player (connected to a hi-fi system).\nThis scheme is working fine with my android phone without any configuration.

If format is not specified, the default of out%d.pnm (or out%d.tif for --format tiff) will be used. format is given as a printf style string with one integer parameter. \n\n\n*\n\n*--batch-start start selects the page number to start naming files with. If this option is not given, the counter will start at 0. \n\n*--batch-count count specifies the number of pages to attempt to scan. If not given, scanimage will continue scanning until the scanner returns a state other than OK. Not all scanners with document feeders signal when the ADF is empty, use this command to work around them. \n\n*With --batch-increment increment you can change the amount that the number in the filename is incremented by. Generally this is used when you are scanning double-sided documents on a single-sided document feeder.\n\n*A specific command is provided to aid this: --batch-double will automatically set the increment to 2. --batch-prompt will ask for pressing RETURN before scanning a page. This can be used for scanning multiple pages without an automatic document feeder. \n", "Q: Accidentally departitioned in Ubuntu installation - now boot manager doesn't work OK, I've spectacularly failed at the Ubuntu installation process, and my new computer is now unusable. I realize that this is somewhat of a specialized case, but I'd really be extradinarily grateful for any help that can be provided. I will try to supply all the relevant details:\nBasically, I started off wanting to install Ubuntu 13.10 alongside Windows 8. I set up a 30GB partition for the installation. I got an apparently common issue where the setup did not recognize Windows 8. I have been running the Ubuntu installation off of a USB drive.\nIn my attempts to install Ubuntu (which began with a \"??? ???\" error that I asked about on this site, and then once I was able to bypass that I got an errno 5 error), I had to launch and relaunch the installer several times. Each time I did so, I had to go to the following screen and manually set aside the 30GB partition.\nNow, after I got the \"??? ???\" error for the umpteenth time, I noticed that it took me back to the screen shown in Image 1, but this time the operating system was detected, and that it was Ubuntu, and that the first option was to reinstall Ubuntu. Figuring that this was referring to the 30GB partition, I chose this option.\nI got the errno 5 error again, meaning that no actual installation took place. But when I launched the installer again, I got the following screen:\nImage 1:  The faulty partitioning\n\nPreviously, there had been a ~217GB partition, the partition containing my Windows 8, and the 30GB partition that I had been playing around with. But now it's the same partition.\nPreviously, when I launched Ubuntu from the USB, and then restarted my computer, the Boot Manager would show Windows 8 as the only boot option. Now, there are no boot options. I can still run Ubuntu by plugging in my USB.\nImage 2:  Boot manager doesn't show Windows.\n\nDo I have any option of re-partitioning the 247GB so that I get my Windows 8 back? Or do I have no other choice but reinstalling Windows 8? \n\nA: Boot up off of a live CD and selecting Test Ubuntu or whatever it says then get your network card configured so you can get online. Then once you have access to the internet your going to want to install a program called testdisk. The program is awesome and it will find and recover your old partitions. You shouldn't have to reinstall windows, I have even used it to recover partions that had been formatted. \nLost Partition\nIf you made a mistake while partitioning and the partition no longer appears in the partition table, so long as you have not written data in that space, all your data is still there.\nInstalling Software while running from Live CD\nGo to /etc/apt/sources.list file and uncomment every section, once done with that run apt-get update followed by apt-get install testdisk, can also do this for any other package your needing to install that is not on the live cd based system. Do not run apt-get dist-upgrade as the system will not be able to do the actually upgrades while running from a live cd. If your running from a USB key this will work for almost everything but might in fact fail for hal the kernel and the initrd image but should work for everything else.\nTestdisk\nAlternatively, the testdisk application should be able to recover your partition. Use apt-get to install the tesdisk package. Run testdisk and it will scan your computer for media (hard drives, sd cards and any other drives) and offer you a menu-driven way to recover your partition. If your not running it as root you will need to run it as follows:\nsudo testdisk\nAlso do yourself a favor even if the drive your working on is not large or isn't quite damaged this process could take a long time to do its job. If for some reason the process was to stop, you would have to restart the whole thing over again. But When you start test disk you can have it create a log file and then it would continue from whereever it left off last time, you can do that by feeding it options like this:\ntestdisk /log /dev/sda\nIf your imaging the whole disk or if its just a single partition table\ntestdisk /log /dev/sda1\nIf your drive is really hosed and it turns into doing data recover there is another program called photorec that is part of testdisk, and again... awesome stuff, really powerful and have used both of these to save data for a lot of clients now over the years. \n", "Q: Install Glassfish 4 on Amazon EC2 Ubuntu instance I have a EC2 instance on AWS running Ubuntu 13.10 and I need to install Glassfish 4 on it.

How do I do that without losing my data files?  \n\nA: If I'm correct, there is no way to upgrade from 12.04 to 13.10 directly unless you reinstall Ubuntu completely, which will lead to a loss of data.\nMy advice is, backup your important files - this is important. Whether or not your files are supposed to be deleted does not matter - accidents can and will happen.\nAfter backing up, you can upgrade from 12.04 to 12.10, then to 13.04, then to 13.10 by running\ndo-release-upgrade\n\nin a terminal.\nHowever, this is extremely slow as you will be upgrading 3 times. My recommendation is, copy your files to another device (perhaps using the 13.10 Live CD) and reinstall your Ubuntu.\nSummary: Two choices.\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup files and upgrade 3 times using do-release-upgrade, or\n\n*Reinstall Ubuntu 13.10 after copying files elsewhere.\n\n", "Q: Video Drivers Reinstall I was trying to fix Steam, as it was showing nothing but white in the client. I updated all the video drivers, and after I did that Steam refused to even load up, so I removed / uninstalled all my video drivers, now when I turn on my computer, it gets stuck at the \"Low Graphics\" warning pop-up.\nHow do I reinstall the video drives so Ubuntu will work again?\n\nA: As Richard indicates in his comment.\n1) Find what kind of video card you have:\nOpen a terminal with CtrlAltT and issue the command sudo lshw -class video\n2) Find what driver is required for it.\nThere are a number of ways to do this. \na) You can run Additional Drivers and see if one comes up as Recommended and choose that.\nb) You can search Google for \"Ubuntu\" and/or \"Linux\" and the  that shows up on the vendor line of your lshw output and/or the  that shows up on the product line of your lshw output.\nc) You can visit the card manufacturers site as found on the aforementioned vendor line and locate Linux drivers there.\n3) install it.\nThis process may vary. \na) If you found it in Additional Drivers, the Additional Drivers app will allow you to \"Apply Changes\" after driver selection.\nb) If you found it via Google, you may find installation instructions there.\nc) If you found it on the manufacturers site, installation instructions are normally included, either on the page where you found the driver or in a README in the driver package.\nIf you still have difficulty at this point you will be armed with the information you obtained going through this process which will be helpful in searching the site for an answer specific to your hardware. This information will also be useful if you don't find an answer searching and need to ask a new question. You should be asked for the output of the aforementioned command if you don't include it (including is recommended).\n", "Q: How do I show missing icons in the system tray? I have two programs; Retroshare and cameramonitor (which are both great programs) that will not show in the system tray. It's frustrating.\n\nA: The answer depends on the system you have.

Ubuntu offers an easy GUI interface that allows you to edit, (de-)activate and remove PPAs. \nBut going through all the GUI dialogs and menus can sometimes be tedious, especially if you have a lot of PPAs added to your system.\nThat's why I was wondering if there was a way to disable (and enable) a PPA from the command-line.\n\nNote: I am not talking about adding/removing the PPA (that's quite easy to do: sudo add-apt-repository ppa / sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa). What I am looking for is a way to temporarily disable a PPA and reenable it at will - all from within the CLI.\n\nEdit:\nSushantp606 and Davidson Chua's answers were a good starting point and made me change the scope of my question. It's certainly good to know that repositories can be managed with the sources.list files but this still looks like a very tedious task to me. I would love to know if there is a way to automate this in the same manner the Software Properties window does.\nIdeally I would like to find a command that will make it possible to quickly enable and disable a PPA by its PPA address, e.g.:\nppa_activate ppa:synapse-core/ppa\n\nand\nppa_deactivate ppa:synapse-core/ppa\n\n\nA: ppa info is actually saved in separate files in /etc/apt/sources.list. Here is the code which will do the desired action to de-activate or activate desired repo. Save the code given below in a file, say mod-ppa\n#!/bin/bash\nmydir=/etc/apt/sources.list.d\nfunction getlist(){\n    echo -e \"\\n\\tchose one of the following lists\"\n    echo -e \"\\t================================\"\n    for itm in `seq 1 $1`\n    do\n        echo -e \"\\t`echo $2 | awk -v x=$itm '{print $x}' | awk -F/ '{print $NF}'`\"\n    done\n}\n\nif [ $# -lt 1 ]\nthen\n    echo \"E: mod_ppa: missing operand\"\n    echo \"Try 'mod_ppa --help' for more information.\"\n    exit 0\nelif [ $# -lt 2 ]\nthen\n    echo -e \"E: syntax error,\\nTry 'mod_ppa --help' for more information.\"\n    exit 0\nfi\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n    -d )\n        ppa=`ls $mydir/$2*.list`\n        num=`echo $ppa | wc -w`\n        if [ `echo $num` -gt 1 ]\n        then\n            getlist \"$num\" \"$ppa\"\n        else\n            if [ -e $mydir/$2*.list ]\n            then\n                sed -i \"s/^deb\\-src/\\#deb\\-src/\" $ppa\n                sed -i \"s/^deb\\ http/\\#deb\\ http/\" $ppa\n            else\n                echo \"E: ppa does not exist/check ppa name\"\n            fi\n        fi\n        ;;\n    -a )\n        ppa=`ls $mydir/$2*.list`\n        num=`echo $ppa | wc -w`\n        if [ `echo $num` -gt 1 ]\n        then\n            getlist \"$num\" \"$ppa\"\n        else\n            if [ -e $mydir/$2*.list ]\n            then\n                sed -i \"s/^\\#deb\\-src/deb\\-src/\" $ppa\n                sed -i \"s/^\\#deb\\ http/deb\\ http/\" $ppa\n            else\n                echo \"E: ppa does not exist/check ppa name\"\n            fi\n        fi\n        ;;\n    --help)\n        echo \"Usage: mod_ppa [OPTION] [PPA NAME'S INITIAL PART]\"\n        echo \"Mandatory argument options.\"\n        echo \"-a       Activate certain ppa\"\n        echo \"-d       Deactivate certain ppa\"\n        ;;\n    * ) \n        echo \"mod_ppa: invalid option '$1'\"\n        echo \"Try 'mod_ppa --help' for more information.\"\n        ;;\nesac\n\nsave the script in /home/<username>/bin/, which is in PATH usually.

Anyway there is only few, you can deactivate them by hand if you wish to. Sushantp606's answer was quite helpful.\nHow it works\nWhen any ppa repo is deactivated using Software center (GUI), it actually puts a # in front of all the lines inside corresponding ppa .list file at /etc/apt/sources.list.d/. Usually most of the .list files contain two lines that begins with deb http and deb-src, a few have only one. The above script is doing the same thing using sed. First it checks the ppa .list (input by user) is present or not. Then put or remove a # in front the lines accordingly.\nAs the script is supposed to deal with some sensitive part of OS, I tried to code it defensively. Kept checks for what arguments are being passed to the script and set some error messages accordingly. Also a small help is added. These part increases the length of code.\n\nA: Even a simpler script to toggle between activating or deactivating a particular ppa.

The code acts in a very interactive manner. When someone runs this along with ppa name as its argument, it will display the PPA's current status and what the code is going to do on successful execution. Then it will ask permission of the user. Only if the user inputs 'y' to confirm the code will change the status of the PPA and activate/deactivate it. It will immediately abort if the user puts an 'n' for no.\n\nA: By editing \n/etc/apt/sources.list \nfile from the command line, we can add, remove, or temporarily disable software repositories.just comment out unwanted repo via terminal . \nI cant make the command ,its just an idea . let me know if you could connect it via terminal command like-\nThe command to comment out the source repositories in /etc/apt/sources.list is:\nsudo sed -i 's/^deb\\-src/\\#deb\\-src/' /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nand to un comment it use \nsudo sed -i 's/^\\#deb\\-src/deb\\-src/' /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nuse repository you want to disable/comment out instead of  s/^\\#deb\\-src/deb\\-src/ and before doing any change make a backup source list file as below-\nsudo cp -v /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.backup\n\n\nA: Take a look at How to disable a particular PPA?. Although the first answer by qeoh uses the GTK frontend, the second answer by minimec suggests commenting out the ppa in /etc/apt/sources.list.

But this thread is one of the top ranking Google results for people searching how to disable a PPA without remove it.\nThe easiest way is just disable by comments the entry in /etc/apt/sources.list.d folder. By the way is how the \"Software & Updates\" works when disable an entry in the \"Other Updates\" tab.\nExample: disable Chrome updates\nOpen a terminal and edit /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list file:\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list\n\nThen disable the deb line like this:\n# deb [arch=amd64] http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main\n\nSave it and done.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 Mirror Display Error I've just upgraded my Ubuntu to 13.10 Saucy using dist-upgrade.

I have a Wacom Bamboo Touch tablet connected to my Ubuntu computer, and there are two annoyances: \n\n\n*\n\n*The touchpad-mouse cursor is much too sensitive, making it impossible to click anything.  \n\n*Two-finger touch (scroll) has a delay of ~ half a second before scrolling. How do I remove this?\n\n\nI've looked around a lot and basically there is no GUI control panel at all. When you enter:\nxsetwacom --list parameters \nYou get a lot of parameters that can be changed, but the only thing that seems to relate to touch is turning it on or off:\nxsetwacom --set \"Wacom Bamboo 2FG 4x5 Finger touch\" Touch off\n\nA: It looks like the initial lag / delay we're experiencing when trying to scroll using the two finger scroll gesture is due to a bug in xf86-input-wacom.\nThe parameter for controlling the scroll threshold is not exposed at all. Version 0.27.0 of xf86-input-wacom should be fixed (fix was pushed in September of this year). Ubuntu 14.04 LTS is still running 0.23.0.\nRead http://sourceforge.net/p/linuxwacom/bugs/218/ for more details.\nWith regard to your touchpad sensitivity question I have no answer.\n\nA: The parameters you want to adjust are Threshold and ScrollDistance.  Try setting both at the extremes (say, 5 and 100) to understand the effect of each, then adjust them to your liking.\nExamples:\nxsetwacom set \"Wacom Bamboo 2FG 4x5 Finger touch\" Threshold 50\nxsetwacom set \"Wacom Bamboo 2FG 4x5 Finger touch\" ScrollDistance 100\n\nAs far as the delay, that's something that bothers me a lot because I'm using an Intuos Pen & Touch as a mouse replacement, so I understand where you're coming from.  I don't think the ScrollDistance is functioning as described in the documentation, because it sounds like it's supposed to adjust the delay you mention.  In reality, however, it seems to adjust the distance required to scroll a certain amount on the screen.\nThe result is a low ScrollDistance acts very sensitive and allows you to scroll very quickly, but it still has that initial delay, so you might scroll through 100 pages before the action is completed.  For now the best compromise seems to be to adjust ScrollDistance very high (I use 100), so scrolling doesn't cause you to lose your place on the page.\nEdit:  You may also want to make sure that your touch input Mode is set to Relative instead of Absolute.  This makes it function like a trackpad, whereas Absolute maps the entire screen to the tablet surface, amplifying any movements since the screen is so much larger than the tablet.\nExample:\n    xsetwacom set \"Wacom Bamboo 2FG 4x5 Finger touch\" Mode Relative\n\n", "Q: Can't log on to Ubuntu 13.10 I downloaded Ubuntu 13.10 using Netbootin Cd 5.2 and everything went okay till i tried to log on.

Every boot I need to press ESC and enter rescue mode and just press Resume and after this the system boots normally. If I try to do a normal restart I get a black screen after Ubuntu logo again.\nI tried switching nvidia driver in the options - I have version 319-updates and version 319 [Recommended], but neither works.\nI have Palit GeForce GTX650, all updates.\nMy dmesg output\nOutput of dpkg --get-selections | grep 'nvi\\|nou'\nMy /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nA: The proprietary nvidia driver should be used without KMS. You have to edit the /etc/default/grub file, use your favourite text editor (vi, nano, gedit, etc.):\nsudo vi /etc/default/grub \nChange the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" line to the following:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash nomodeset\"\n\nSave the file, then run sudo update-grub Then reboot, and it should work.\nIf it still doesn't solve it, then remove also \"quiet splash\" from the previous line, and again sudo update-grub. (This will disable the graphical boot screen.)  \nThe recovery booting did work, because the recovery menu entry had the nomodeset parameter.\n\nA: I had same problem with 2 laptops with similar Nvidia cards.\nThe solution I have found after trying many Ubuntu flavors with similar problem is to install fresh Kubuntu, and then, before you perform any software updates, use the Synaptic Package Manager, filter for nvidia and go to package / force version and keep nvidia filtered packages to the installed version in order to prevent them from upgrading.\nThen, you can install other desktop flavors if you want (I have tested adding in second step my favorites GNOME and Xfce without any problems). I think, if my memory serves me well, the Nvidia driver used and kept using is 173.x (or 176.x).\n\nA: This is X Server error. If X Server update itself then it will also delete the path of the graphic driver. The only way perhaps is to install what Ubuntu has to offer (namely drivers in 'Additional Drivers'). \nI have AMD A10 with AMD Radeon HD8650 with CrossFire AMD Radeon HD 8970m and installed a driver found in AMD websites, after an updates, the X server failed. I have to reinstall 'fglrx' (AMD drivers for Ubuntu) and the X server works again, only this time, it couldn't identify my 8970m, but identify it as other AMD GPU.\nI'm not sure about nVidia, but my advice is try not to install anything beyond what Ubuntu gave you. If it's from Ubuntu, higher chances are it will work.\n\nA: So this GTX650 Geforce card of Nvidia has CUDA-Technology as I see in description at\nwebsite of nvidia.com\nHere I posted a workaround for CUDA-cards, which normally refers to Ubuntu 12.10 and\nworked there fine:\nHow can I Install Nvidia Driver GT 520 and Cuda 5.0 in Ubuntu13.04?\nIt is humblesome, but not too tricky.\nThis workaround normally concerns hybrid-cards of nvidia, but I don't see, why it should not work with your card.\n\nA: In the grub boot menu i chose an earlier kernel version and managed to boot into my os. I think this is because the nouveau drivers were loaded instead of the nvidia drivers.\n\nA: Change the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" line to:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"nomodeset\"\n\nSave the file, then run sudo update-grub\nWorks great for nvidia 307.\nYou loose only purple startup screen, but you'll see how is system starting. \n", "Q: how to delete grub in dual boot of windows 8 and ubuntu I had installed windows 8 and ubuntu in my laptop. but after that by mistake i formatted the drive in which ubuntu was installed so now when ever i reboot my machine i get the error: unknown filesystem and grub rescue.

Well, enough to get past it anyway...\nApparently Ubuntu stores the UTC time to the system time in the BIOS and Windows stores the local time. If the system time reads 12:00PM, Ubuntu adjusts to display the correct time for your time zone. For example, Central Time is UTC-6 so it would read the 12:00PM system time and subtract the 6 hours for me and show 6:00AM.\nWindows on the other hand saves the local time. So if I save the clock to show 6:00AM in Windows, Ubuntu will no longer display the correct time. I have no idea why this causes Ubuntu not to boot AT ALL but it is what it is...\nI got Ubuntu back up and running by using boot-repair. I booted to an Ubuntu install disc and typed this from the terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\n\nThen I selected Recommended Repair and restarted once it was finished.\nThere's a way to either force Ubuntu to treat the system time as the local time or force Windows to treat it as UTC time. This link showed me how to do that:\nClock time is off on dual boot\n", "Q: Best most Stable partition layout for Linux I had had many issues regarding data loss due to GRUB breakage & unable to boot in my OS e.g see my latest mishap here:\nGrub rescue unknown filesystem...the ultimate hopelessness\nThe problem lies in the fact that I want a stable yet portable OS able to boot in computers of varied hardware profiles. So far in my experience of 3 years or so the best was offered by Debian (precisely Crunchbang)! It never got corrupted & provided an overall stable performance though the lack of latest technologies incorporation made me to look towards LTS Ubuntu versions.\nWhat I want is a stable partition profile with atleast one NTFS partition that will act as buffer storage b/w Windows & *nix OS. I mostly use mechanical 2.5' hd encased in portable casing therefore I want an advice for the best stable partition profile to ensure consistency\nFor instance my Crunchbang layout is:\nDisk /dev/sdb: 31.4 GB, 31440961536 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 3822 cylinders, total 61408128 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x0007199b\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdb1            2048    42975231    21486592    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sdb2   *    42975232    60792831     8908800   83  Linux\n/dev/sdb3        60792832    61407231      307200   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\n/dev/sdb1: LABEL=\"CRUNCH\" UUID=\"0618C75418C74183\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n/dev/sdb2: UUID=\"351b88b1-0c89-4ce2-ae29-3d2986f4c67f\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sdb3: UUID=\"63aedc80-77c3-4ce4-9533-8bc3bd6496b9\" TYPE=\"swap\"\n\nFurther Notes: My company is primarily Intel powered so by \"varied hardware profiles\" I don't mean AMD only Intel x32 but you know this includes Pentium D onwards to i7\n\nA: Most likely the issues you had experienced in the past are not due to partition layout as such.  Most likely the bootloader configuration and not using UUID to reference the partitions in fstab.  Those were problems, but those have been solved long ago and I think most modern distro's will use UUID to reference partitions by default now.\nI'd simply start with a fresh external HDD, install Ubuntu to it but manually partition the disk when prompted.  Leave space at the end of the drive for NTFS.\nThen install Ubuntu. \nLater, using gparted you can create an NTFS volume at the end of the drive for use in windows.\nYou'll need to install the ntfs-3g fuse drivers later to get ntfs support under ubuntu.\n\nA: I would recommend a simple, but working layout.\n/dev/sdb1 - / - 20G - ext4 - Mount Read only by default\n/dev/sdb2 - /home - ext4 - Lots O space - Mount Read/Write\n/dev/sdb3 - /media/fat - fat32 - Some Space - Mount Read/Write\n/dev/sdb4 - swap - whatever you need -\nIn /etc/fstab Just mount / read only and /home read/write. It will be a pain to update, you will need to remount / read/write. That said, it would be exceptionally stable, even if you yank the drive (still don't recommend it). That said you will end up with a USB disk that you can (in theory) boot from that will contain the entire OS, and still allow you to move from one computer to another.\nImportant notes: \n\n\n*\n\n*You still need to do backups. \n\n*If you yank the drive while in use, there is a lower chance that the / partition will have issue but /home still has a high chance.  You should always be able to boot though. \n\n*I choose fat32 or NTFS swap it out if you like, but fat32 is still more portable if you can live wit it's limitations. \n\n*You may want to look into how live CDs use a ramdisk for /. That could let you write to / temporarily, Without it, you WILL have issues with directories like /var or /tmp. You can ramdisk /tmp, but /var is going to be tricky. You could make another partition for /var, but the liveCD style option would be a bit better. \n\n\nA: I'm not positive what your looking for, but I can suggest to you what I use.\nIf you are running off an /sdb I assume there is an /sda of similar size. You can run RAID 1 which will backup your data in the event a hard drive fails.\nIf you do not have a second hard drive built into your computer, you can pick a cheap external HDD up at BestBuy or another electronics store. With this, you can still configure linux raid and be portable at the same time!\nwhen setting up raid, It will create a partition that acts as one drive which you can then partition out to other needs.\nHope I helped!\n", "Q: How can I force Workrave to start in Normal mode? I use Workrave for RSI prevention and rest breaks. [*] Sometimes I need to put it in Quiet or Suspended mode, for example when giving a presentation. However, it remembers this setting the next time I log in, and I might forget to put it back.\nHow can I make Workrave always start in Normal mode?\n[*] It starts up every time I log in, but I can't remember/find how I did this.\n\nA: Workrave does not have this functionality built-in. Instead, you will have to create a trigger to achieve this. You can do this by adding the following command to Startup Applications:\ndbus-send --type=method_call --dest=org.workrave.Workrave /org/workrave/Workrave/Core org.workrave.CoreInterface.SetOperationMode string:'normal'\n\nRegarding login behaviour, Workrave always starts when you log in, there is no option for it to do otherwise. You could achieve the effect of it not starting by setting it to Suspended on startup:\ndbus-send --type=method_call --dest=org.workrave.Workrave /org/workrave/Workrave/Core org.workrave.CoreInterface.SetOperationMode string:'suspended'\n\n(Note I am using Cuttlefish (see also Launchpad project) to make these calls rather than Startup Applications, but the results should be the same.)\n\nThere are existing requests to implement this functionality:\n\n\n*\n\n*Force Workrave mode on startup\n\n*Make Workrave startup optional\n\nAlternatives\nIn theory you can also use dconf to set these values as follows (0 - Normal, 1 - Suspended, 2 - Quiet):\ndconf write /org/workrave/general/operation-mode 0\n\nHowever, there is a bug preventing this from working in Workrave 1.10.2.0. This has been fixed for the next release.\n\nA: Sadly workrave doesn't have such option. You should find out where you put the autostart and disable it (or just remember that you have it):\n\nOPTIONS\nWorkrave does not take any options besides the standard GNOME options.\n\n(workrave man)\n\nA: Is so simple, I crossed for the same, you have to remember that the icon changes, you will not see the sheep, you see something like a door, click on it, and a window will display with many options, click on option mode and change to start.\n", "Q: How to configure pkexec to not ask for password? I have a GUI application that needs to call a daemon (written in Python) with superuser privileges. I would like to do this without prompting the user for a password. \nSince the daemon is a script, I can't set the SUID bit directly. I could write a C wrapper for this, but I'd rather not reinvent the wheel, especially when a mistake on my part could lead to the system's security being severely compromised.\nWhat I'd normally do in this situation is to add a line in /etc/sudoers that allows users to execute the daemon as root without a password, using the NOPASSWD directive. This works fine from the command line. However, when I do this from the GUI, a pkexec dialog pops up asking for the user's password. It seems that on Ubuntu, calls to sudo from the GUI are somehow being intercepted by pkexec.\nIs there a clean way around this? I'd really rather not have to deal with the hassles of a setuid script.\n\nA: It's improper to say that: \"It seems that on Ubuntu, calls to sudo from the GUI are somehow being intercepted by pkexec\". pkexec doesn't have much in common with sudo. In contrast with sudo, pkexec does not grant root permission to an entire process, but rather allows a finer level of control of centralized system policy.\nNow, if you want to run a GUI application without being asked by a password by pkexec, this is not difficult to be done. Let's take for example GParted. When you open it, you will see the following dialog window asking you by a password:\n\nClick Details and the dialog window will look now like:\n\nFrom here all you have to do is to open /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/com.ubuntu.pkexec.gparted.policy file using for example the following command:\ngksu gedit /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/com.ubuntu.pkexec.gparted.policy\n\nand change the following lines:\n      <allow_any>auth_admin</allow_any>\n      <allow_inactive>auth_admin</allow_inactive>\n      <allow_active>auth_admin</allow_active>\nwith the followings:\n      <allow_any>yes</allow_any>\n      <allow_inactive>yes</allow_inactive>\n      <allow_active>yes</allow_active>\nSave the file and close it. Next, when you will open GParted you will not be asked for a password anymore.\n", "Q: Read error while installing DraftSight in Ubuntu 13.04 root@porjecta:/# gdebi draftSight.deb \nReading package lists...

My institute has an internal network that can be accessed via a VPN server. It s turned on with a modprobe tun followed by a service openvpn start (which asks for remote authentication)\nI need OpenVPN as I wish to ssh to a computing server in the institute network. However, due to certain restrictions, accessing the Internet from within the institute network is hard (and possibly impossible with the added layer of the vpn). When I open up Chrome and try to access an internet site, it takes me to a captive portal page that doesn't let me log in properly (I presume it detects that I am coming from the VPN IP and not from a regular internal IP).\nHow can I tell Chrome to use my regular home wifi connection instead of going through the vpn tunnel, while having SSH go through VPN?\n\nA: You have to manually define the routes. The exact syntax of the command is going to vary with you interfaces, gateway, and what traffic you wish to route where. Web traffic (chrome) is on ports 80 (http) and 443 (https) by default.\nHere are 2 explanations of how to route your traffic.\nhttp://kindlund.wordpress.com/2007/11/19/configuring-multiple-default-routes-in-linux/\nhttp://www.rjsystems.nl/en/2100-adv-routing.php\n\nA: On OpenVPN usually the server \"decides\" this for you: It can be configured to tell clients to send all their traffic (by default) through the VPN - which makes sense e.g. if the VPN is used to secure your internet connection.\nThe openVPN configuration you are using is probably setting your \"default route\" so most connections (to the internet) are made through the VPN.\nAs your institute probably does not want to provide internet access through their VPN (i am just guessing), they would have to change the configuration on the server.\nAs a hint for the admin that configures the VPN server: The configuration probably includes a line like this:\npush \"redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp\" \n\nCommenting out that line and reloading the server should resolve the issue for all clients.\nIf there is somehow no way to change the server configuration, you will have to rely on some \"hacking\" for this issue on your client - but since this should really be resolved on the server side, i won't get deeper into this (yet).\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu phones be root-locked?

I have had no success in finding out how the thing works on my Ubuntu 13.04 64Bit computer. I am wondering if I am just a dummy with printers or if it cant print at all any help would be extremely appreciated.\n\nA: I have the same printer and installed two .deb files to get it to work with Ubuntu (both 12.04 and 13.04).  Ubuntu does not have the printer driver by default so I had to go to the Brother Website, download the LPR driver (.deb file) and the Cups Wrapper driver (.deb file) for this printer.

If you try to install the Cups Wrapper Driver first, you will get \"Dependency not satisfiable\".\n\n\n*\n\n*If you run the .deb files by double clicking in Nautilus (The File Viewer) it should open the file in Ubuntu Software Center and allow you to install. When you install, you will get a message that the Package \"is of bad quality\", CLICK ON the \"Ignore and Install\" button.\nAfter you install both, under printers, you will probably not see a printer icon, click on the Add Button, you should be able to see the the Printer under Network Printers since it is a Wifi Printer, you will see it listed twice, at least one of them will work.\nIf neither of them work..

I am trying to get an idea if indexers like Zeitgist or Nepomuk are in active use by the various desktops or are they being phased out and replaced?\nMost of the documentation online for these seem to be a year or three old, which might indicate that they are not in active development.\nWhat does KDE use now and what are the plans for the next year or so?\nSame with Gnome, Unity, LXDE. Where are they going in the next year?\nUbuntu 14.04 will be a LTS support release, so it would be good to know what it's fundamental indexing technology will be.\n\nA: First of all, to clarify, Zeitgeist is not an indexer, in the same sense that the systems provided by Nepomuk and Tracker are. Zeitgeist is for logging activity, while Nepomuk/Tracker are for indexing content. The latter are for finding things, and Zeitgeist is for finding when those things were accessed/used.\nNepomuk is the KDE indexing infrastructure. Tracker is the GNOME one. Unity uses Zeitgeist for some stuff, but doesn't actually have a specific indexing service it uses. The Unity dash interacts with scopes, and you could have a scope that searched in Tracker, Nepomuk, Google, or anywhere else.\n\nA: My research has indicated that all 3 of these are in active use. I went through the manifest files of Ubuntu, UbuntuGnome and Kubuntu and searched through the websites of SuSe and Redhat.\nNepomuk is used in KDE, has been for several years and is in upcoming releases.\nZeigeist is used in Unity and in recent Gnome versions and is in upcoming releases.\nTracker is used in Gnome, has been for several years and is in upcoming releases.\n", "Q: After upgrading to 13.10 kernel panic - not syncing Until today I used 12.04. This afternoon I ugraded to 12.10 then 13.04 and finally to 13.10 .\nEverything seemed normal during the updates. Afterwards on 13.10 I kept getting an error message related to oracle virtualbox. Since I don't use it anymore, I removed the package with synaptic. Following the next restart, I was greeted with a kernel panic screen (http://i.imgur.com/4D6HRj3.jpg).\nI've tried to boot older kernels without success (3.8.0-33-generic, 3.5.0-43-generic, 3.2.0-56-generic) and the recovery mode didn't work either. (on the puprle background screen I can choose any options only to end up with the same result: a flash of the lines, all starting with error, then back to the recovery menu.)\nHow do I resolve this?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: The first line in the error screen-shot leads to a issue with Astrill VPN. The rest just seams to be the kernel telling you that it has crashed. More info about the Astrill VPN issue can be found here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2139793\nI would fix this by getting to the recovery root terminal and removing Astrill.\nStart up the computer and press Shift just as Ubuntu starts (This can be tricky to time right). Select the root command prompt option when you get to the selection screen. Mount root as read and write with this command: mount -o remount,rw / . Then run apt-get --purge astrill .

The good news is that the kernel isn't panicking which means that you could probably fix this issue with enough work. The bad news is I have no idea what is broken. It could be an easy fix or it could be a multi hour long slug fest and still not have a working computer.\n\nI have a bootable ubuntu 13.10 usb which i tried and it worked. so my\n  question is will i have to install ubuntu again and will it erase all\n  my other stuff and could i fix the flashing _\n\nIf you install from the usb key it will delete your stuff from your previous install. If you have back ups of your files and don't have anything you need on your computer you can just do a fresh install of 13.10 and get back to a working computer. Otherwise you can either try fixing your problem or just recovering the files on your computer.\nI would recommend just installing 13.10 if you were planning on upgrading to it anyways. It sounds like you are not an technical savvy user and trying to fix your old install will just lead to head-aches.\n", "Q: Opening Abiword files Abiword files no longer (12.04) open themselves, but need to be called by the main menu to do so - with Abiword (what else!)

After spending hours trying to compile evolution-mapi from source on 13.10, I've finally run into \nchecking for LIBMAPI... no\nconfigure: error: libmapi wasn't found! Please install at least libmapi-2.0!\n\nThough libmapi-dev is installed on my system, I've no evidence that libmapi-2.0 even exists. Is there a fix for this?\n\nA: libmapi is part of the openchange project from openchange.org.  You can get the required version from there.\nIt depends on Samba 4 to compile.  I'm not sure if that's available in Ubuntu or not.  You may end up compiling your way down the dependency tree.  :)  Checkinstall is your friend in that case.\nAdditionally, libmapi-2 appears to be available in Debian unstable.  You could try grabbing that directly and see if it's compatible with Ubuntu.  If it is not, then you could grab the source package and build that to get it.  I can't guarantee that will work, but it does about 90% of the time in my experience, although occasionally you end up having to do the same with some dependencies.  Backing up your system before you start is highly recommended.\nHopefully this works for you.  Sadly I can't give you exact steps since I'm not trying to do this on Ubuntu myself, but it should be what you need to know to figure it out from here.\n", "Q: EagleCad stopped working after update to 13.10 If I try to execute the program from terminal I get this error:\n/home/rick/eagle-6.4.0/bin/eagle: error while loading shared libraries:\nlibXcursor.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nThe program worked fine in 13.04.\n\nA: libXcursor library is missing.

I don't want to dual boot, either. \nI don't have physical external storage available (flash drives, discs, etc). I do have 15 GB on Google Drive, but it is not enough (Nowhere else offers nearly that much storage). \n\nA: Well, there are 2 cheap/easy solution is (if your hard disk can hold the double of data that you have):\nUsing Ubuntu almost all the time (aka I don't want to use Windows)\n\n\n*\n\n*Defragment the Windows partition.\n\n*Boot up with the Ubuntu live cd/usb. \n\n*Start GParted.\n\n*Shrink the NTFS partition.\n\n*Create another partition.\n\n*Store the stuff in the new partition.\n\n*Remove the old partition.\n\n*Tell the installer to install in the empty space.\n\n*Profit.\n\n\nUsing whatever is available (aka I don't care what to use if I get the job done)\n\n\n*\n\n*Defragment the Windows partition.\n\n*Open the Disk Management Util\n\n*Shrink the NTFS partition.\n\n*Create another partition.\n\n*Store the stuff in the new partition.\n\n*Boot up with the Ubuntu live cd/usb. \n\n*Remove the old partition.\n\n*Tell the installer to install in the empty space.\n\n*Profit\n\n\nI recommend at least have another copy somewhere faraway of you, in case some follows the Murphy's law.\n\nA: If you are severely restricted from acquiring physical storage, one option possible is to resize your HDD's partitions in order to have a new, empty partition with at least as many space as needed for the files. Then move the files to the new partition, and install Lubuntu on a different partition.\nThis is a very risky procedure, because if anything goes wrong while resizing the partitions, then you risk losing all your data, so I'd recommend backing up your files previously.

That's fine and all, but how do I get to the Ubuntu partition that's somewhere on the hard drive still? I believe it is an extended partition, not a primary.\n\nA: It sounds like when you installed Windows 7 it wrote over the mbr (Master Boot Record) and now it only boots to Windows. You should be able to fix this issue by using this tool: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\nBasically, your Ubuntu operating system should be intact and working if it wasn't damaged when installing Windows. You just need to repair the mbr so that it knows that Ubuntu is on the computer and will let you boot to it. Ubuntu uses a software called Grub to boot between different operating systems. Using the Boot-Repair program should fix the mbr and set up Grub so that you can boot between Windows 7 and Ubuntu.\n", "Q: \"Can't check signature: public key not found\" while upgrading, why?

For now you can ignore the message (or ask to do not show it again). There isn't a way to \"solve\" it (I look up the dconf keys and the preference was nowhere to be found, maybe hard coded).\n\nA: Thank you for giving me some more information to work with Bent. If you want to give more space to Ubuntu than 20Gb you will have to shrink the size of your Windows 7 partition. This can ruin your Windows 7 install easily; so if you haven't already Back Up Your Files!\nFirst, you want to be sure that you have enough unused space in Windows that you can shrink the partition without causing problems. In Windows open the explorer and check the properties of the C: drive. If the drive has enough unused space to give up then move to the next step. Otherwise, remove files until you have enough space.\nSecond, run a disk defragment on Windows. This will group up all the files so it will be easier to move them if they must be moved when resizing.\nThird, boot up a Ubuntu live DvD/USB and run Gparted. This program will let you resize the partitions on your computer. Right click on the swap partition on the very right and select swap-off. This will let you work with the partitions.\nRight click on the large Windows 7 partition and select resize. Subtract the space you wan to give to Ubuntu from this partition.\nRight click on sda4 and select resize. drag it to the left so that there is no gap between partitions. Now resize sda5 (Ubuntu) and do the same.\nOnce everything is done click the green check mark to apply the operations.\nCross your fingers. If everything worked you should now have the extras space on Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Hdmi sound output Hello I just built my first computer and it works fantastic all except for no sound from my hdmi output.

When you do this, df should return different responses for the different paths on different drives.\n\nA: Fire up a terminal and type df and press enter. This will give a list of all drives, how much free space they have and where they are mounted. your home directory is probably in the form of /home/username/ where username is your username. If you have a separate drive for home directories it will probably be mounted on /home, but based on how your question was asked, I suspect that everything is on the flash drive and it is almost full, and that your next question will be how do I move my home directory to a different drive.\n", "Q: juju openstack bundle Machine Configuration:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dell R900\n\n*32GB RAM,\n\n*4 Quad Core @ 2.4 (16 cores)\n\n*1 Virtual Drive configured 500 GB\n\n\nMy question for the day is I am deploying the openstack bundle with juju using 12.04 LTS.

When I installed Ubuntu originally, I had the guided install wipe out Windows for a Ubuntu-only system. However, this ignored my SSD and installed only to the HDD.\nI am now reinstalling Ubuntu on the SSD (with ~/Music, ~/Photos, ~/Downloads, and ~/Videos remaining on the HDD and symlinked from Home). When I formatted the SSD, I created a 200MB EFI partition, a 4GB swap, and a ~28GB root partition. However, the new installation is ignoring the new EFI partition and using the 500mb EFI partition on the HDD, presumably left over from Windows 8.\nCan I simply remove the EFI partition from the HDD, or do I need to take additional steps to maintain a usable system?\n\nA: I recommend you read up on how the EFI boot process works. For instance, my Web page on the topic may help, and in particular the \"EFI Boot Principles\" and \"EFI Boot Loader Installation\" pages.\nBriefly, EFI does not make partitions or disks bootable. Instead, the EFI stores a list of boot loader files in its NVRAM. Any given EFI System Partition (ESP; the type of partition that holds boot loaders) can contain multiple boot loaders, and a computer can have multiple ESPs. If the partition on which a file resides is deleted, or if the file to which the NVRAM entry refers is deleted, then that entry will become useless. It may remain in NVRAM and be skipped or the firmware may try to clean up its NVRAM and remove the entry. Either way, it becomes useless. If the boot loader was useless (say, if it was for a Windows installation that you've deleted), then there's no harm in this. If you delete a boot loader (or its parent partition) that was in use, though, you'll damage the computer's ability to boot.\nIncidentally, there's little advantage to putting an ESP on an SSD. The ESP is read once at boot time, and the files it contains are normally quite small. It will also be accessed on rare occasion when your boot loader is updated. Thus, the performance benefits from putting your ESP on an SSD will be tiny -- you'll probably shave a fraction of a second off of your boot time.\n", "Q: Are there are alts to Yumi multiboot creator tool for ubuntu 12.04? i downloaded the .deb file for yumi from the pendrive website and went the software center opens the file, it says it cant install because the dependencies are not satisfiable : gambus3-runtime.\nit tried to install it but its not it the default respositories.\n\nA: As far as other alternatives to Yumi, there is as stated by @Angel Salinas Huerta, Multisystem.

I have tried downloading apps but none of which seem to work. \n                                      Thanks \n\nA: Handbrake is the best tool for converting .mkv files to .avi files in ubuntu.Run the following commands on terminal to install handbrake in Ubuntu 12.04,\nEdit the /etc/apt/sources.list file,\n sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list\n\nAdd the following lines to the opened sources.list file,\n deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/stebbins/handbrake-snapshots/ubuntu precise main \n deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/stebbins/handbrake-snapshots/ubuntu precise main \n\nThen update the repositories,\n sudo apt-get update\n\nRun this command to install handbrake,\n sudo apt-get install handbrake-gtk\n\n\nA: AS Handbrake doesn't support AVI Output anymore you can do this very rapidly via the command line with avconv like this:\navconv -i infile.mkv -codec copy outfile.avi\nBy using -codec copy you are changing the container only without the need to re-encode the movie. Note: Depending on the codecs in use in the original file you may need to install the Ubuntu restricted extras package first. You can do this via either software center or via the CLI from a terminal with sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras \nSource: Experience\n\nA: Use ffmpeg\nhttps://www.ffmpeg.org/\nffmpeg -i filename.mkv -c:v copy -c:a copy output.avi\n\nsource: https://superuser.com/questions/227338/how-to-convert-an-mkv-to-avi-with-minimal-loss\n\nA: Get WinFF:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:paul-climbing/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install winff\n\nOptionally:\nsudo apt-get install libavcodec-extra-53\n\nIn WinFF, choose a preset like \"Widescreen XVID\", then load the video bitrate, framerate, resolution and audio settings with those of the MKV file (you can get them by right-clicking the file and selecting Properties > Audio/Video). Do a search on Wikipedia for \"Aspect Ratio\" to get the right aspect ratio settings for different resolutions. Converting a 45 minute 720P MKV to AVI takes about 20 minutes on a Core i7 with 24GB RAM.\nSource: \nhttps://code.google.com/archive/p/winff/wikis/UbuntuInstallation.wiki\n", "Q: Migrating 2-disk raid0 installation to single drive I currently have Ubuntu Server 13.10 (upgraded from 12.10) installed on an old Dell PC at home. When I set it up, I tossed in 2 1TB drives, and set up raid0 to simplify using all their space. I know this is basically awful, but it's a media/file server with lots of files that are either backed up elsewhere or easy to replace. \nAnyway, 2TB is approaching being insufficient, and raid0 has me reasonably uncomfortable about the reliability of the system. Although important files are backed up, we've hacked together enough stuff on it in an undocumented way (again, awful, I know) that it'd at very least be unfortunate to lose the system/program/config files. So I'm getting a new 4TB drive to replace both. Ideally, I'd like to also eventually slot in a second 4TB drive and set up raid1, when I can afford it, but that's a secondary goal.\nHowever, the PC only has two ports for drives. I also currently do not have any other single drive with sufficient capacity to copy the entire 2TB to intermediately. What is the best way, if any, to transfer my installation to the 4TB drive? Uptime isn't important, just being able to replace the two drives with one larger one while minimizing other system changes.\n\nA: The simplest way that comes to mind is to connect your new 4TB drive through USB using a suitable external box. Alas it requires the expenditure for the extra hardware. \nIf you have a spare computer, you can attach your new drive on it and then connect the two computers trough network. Once the transfer is complete you can move the drives to their new place. The disadvantage to this is the time to configure things plus the time to transfer the files through ethernet, which will be considerable for the amount of data we are talking about.\n", "Q: No Wifi connection with Acer Aspire 5741G I installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS in my Acer Aspire 5741G  (8GB RAM, Window 7). After installing Ubuntu, I could not connect to Wifi. Although I dragged down the Wifi option, enabled the connection, but I get no connection. I even tried installing a fresh copy, but the problem remains the same. Help. \n\nA: First check your wifi is hardblocked or softblocked by running the below command,\nsudo rfkill list\n\nIf your wifi is softblocked then run the below command to unblock,\nsudo rfkill unblock wlan\n\nIf your wifi is hardblocked then you have to turn on the wifi hardware switch.\n", "Q: Browser does not load certain pages I installed UBUNTU 12.04 and configured for internet access. No issues there. However, my browser (firefox, chromium) is not able to load/display certain pages (mail.yahoo.com, thehindu.com, in.yahoo.com) after loading the web page title. The browser does not have problem with other sites (google, msn, ubuntu, etc...). Any reason why only certain pages are not loading?\n\nA: You may have a bad DNS (Domain Name Service). It's used to look up the numbers that your computer needs to connect to websites.\nGo to your network settings. Edit the connection you use for Internet. Under \"IPv4 Settings\" tab, change the \"Method:\" scroll down to \"Automatic (DHCP) addresses only\". Then in the box labeled \"DNS servers:\" put in 8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4\nThis will set your computer to use Google's public DNS which is a fast and reliable DNS.\n", "Q: Wubi to install Xubuntu 13.10? Is there any wubi that can install xubuntu 13.10?I have the wubi to install 13.10 but is there any wubi to install xubuntu 13.10?\nI hope this question has an answer that could help me\n\nA: Xubuntu hasn't been available with Wubi since release 12.10. The lead Xubuntu developer, Pasi Lallinaho, requested that it be removed (reference):\n\nThere has been discussion about this on the mailing list and on\n  #xubuntu-devel before, but the short answer is that there wasn't enough testers and it was only more workload for the team to support\n  that.\n\nIt's still available on the 12.04 Wubi\nThere is a way to trick Wubi into installing Xubuntu, if you don't mind a bit of work.

Now installing it as a gen 1 works fine but installing it as a gen 2 does not. I have to disable secure boot to get anything to happen which is expected but when I disable it i just get into grub version 2 with a couple options. No matter which i choose I get a blank screen and nothing happens. am I doing something wrong or am I missing any steps or is Hyper-v not going to be able to run Ubuntu as a gen 2 virtual machine?\n\nA: Yes you can!\nThere is only one thing you need to know: Secure Boot has to be disabled. Hyper-V enables secure boot by default so if you just click through the wizard to create a VM it will not work. You have to disable Secure Boot. You can do so by changing the Settings of the virtual machine with the Hyper-V Manager. Under Firmware is an option for Secure Boot.\nhttp://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/24545.installing-ubuntu-14-04-lts-as-a-generation-2-hyper-v-guest.aspx\n\nA: As noted in the discussion in the following blog post by one of the PM's working on Hyper-V it doesn't look like the current Linux distros support Hyper-V gen2.\n\nLinux support is being worked on. It doesn't require any changes in\n  Hyper-V, rather in the set of LIS components, plus some kernel changes\n  to support the appropriate devices.\nCheers,\nJohn.\n\nReference:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://blogs.technet.com/b/jhoward/archive/2013/10/24/hyper-v-generation-2-virtual-machines-part-1.aspx#3605153\n\nA: For the sake of completeness. 14.04 works on Hyper-V generation 2. Among other things kernel version 3.13 is required for generation 2. I am using it myself and it works nicely.\nYou might want to set the screen resolution manually though, as mode setting in the usual way is not yet supported by the hyperv_fb kernel module.\nThis can be archived by opening the file /etc/default/grub with the editor of your choice as root. Then edit the line\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nto read\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"video=hyperv_fb:[width]x[height]\"\n\nreplacing [width] and [height] with the desired values. For example for FullHD resolution I use\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"video=hyperv_fb:1920x1080\"\n\nto apply the new settings run afterwards in a terminal window\nsudo update-grub\n\nand restart the the guest system. The next time your guest Linux should have the desired resolution.\n", "Q: Can i prevent my system reading any USB files? I have some computers around me. I don't want any one to insert any USB. Am afraid someone has malware in the USB when inserting in one computer it will infect the others, because they are connected each other. That happened last time when I brought some experts to fix them.    \nI want to prevent this and make the system doesn't allow any files of working or even reading files from USB. \nIs that possible?\n\nA: Affecting linux is not simple and chances of being affected is really negligible but still if you want then..\nYou can do it by disabling USB , for disabling use -\nsudo echo \"blacklist usb-storage\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nit will create a line as blacklist usb-storage , to enable it again -\nsudo gedit etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nand search for the line \"blacklist usb-storage\" remove it. Be sure what you are going todo before doing anything .\nhope it solves your need..\n\nA: Since you will be prompted before autorun, I would be less concerned with malware being distributed by a mass-storage device.\n\nWhat I would be more concerned with is a malicious USB device that emulates a keyboard or other user input device. To reduce the risk of this type of \"malware\" attack, you could use UDEV rules to disable all USB devices by default and white list specific devices that you regularly use, like your keyboard or mouse.\nSutekh illustrates how to create and enact UDEV rules in Ubuntu here. You basically create a new file under /etc/udev/rules.d/ for your new rules, then restart the udev daemon.\nStéphane gives a nice example of a disable all followed by whitelisting UDEV ruleset. But I would recommend being more specific in your whitelist rule than relying just on idVendor to identify your device.\nThere are over a dozen UDEV attributes to a device that you can use in combination to identify your specific hardware. For instance you can even differentiate between your Dell keyboard and a different Dell keyboard by looking at the bMaxPower and and idProduct attributes.\nWhile it is unlikely that the malicious device will go through a list of keyboard manufacturers to emulate, it is even less likely that they will go through specific product releases from that manufacturer, and specify detailed attributes like bMaxPower.\nThere is no perfectly secure system, and there are always additional steps in security that you can take. The goal of security is to make it not worthwhile for the attacker to expend the effort to attain their goal. Therefore the relative value of compromising your system, to both you and potential attackers should define the defenses that you put in place.\n\nA: Turning off the USB automount in gconf should remedy this.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Gconf by opening your dash then typing \"gconf\"\n\n*Then navigate to / > apps > nautilus > preferences\n\n*Uncheck the media_automount value as seen below\n\n*Then close Gconf and it you should be fine :)\nDoing so will disable the ability for any program on a removable device to automatically execute, although unlikely on Linux it could still be a problem.\nIf you are dual booting or have any computers running Windows make sure you turn off USB autorun for those machines as well.\nsource: http://www.usbduplicatornow.com/disable-autorun-autoplay.html\n", "Q: cann't install libjpeg.so.62 I'm on Ubuntu 12.04.

I am a new Ubuntu user (migrating away from Microsoft/Windows) using Ubuntu 13.10. I like the feature of multiple workspaces. Currently, when I move between the four different workspaces, everything that I am doing in one of the workspaces follows me to the other. If I have LibreOffice up in one, the same documents are up in the other. Likewise, if I have a browser open, everything in that browser follows me to the other workspace.\nIs there a way to have each workspace be completely independent of the other?\nThanks much for your answers!\n\nA: Search isolate workspaces options in your dash, panel or dock settings.\nManually\nRight click dash, dock or panel and select settings, then find isolate-workspaces, make it active.\nProgrammatically\nIf you use dock (dash to dock), this command will help you:\ngsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock isolate-workspaces true\n\nIf you use panel (dash to panel), use this:\ngsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-panel isolate-workspaces true\n\n\nA: I don't know how to do this on the standard desktop that comes with Ubuntu (although I'm sure someone else does) because I don't use it. But ...\nThis is Linux, which means that there's almost always more than one choice. You can use a different desktop manager (there are lots of them) or even have more than one at the same time and choose which one you want to use when you log on to your user account.\nThe KDE desktop manager has several features geared directly toward what you would like to do. Getting and installing it are not too difficult, but that's a separate topic.\nWhat you are calling a \"workspace\" most likely corresponds to what is called a \"virtual desktop\". \nIn the simplest case, there is a task manager widget that you can add to your panel which shows what tasks are running on your desktop. It has an option which will display all tasks or only those which are on the current virtual desktop. You can define as many virtual desktops as you can manage. I use six. When you switch to another virtual desktop, the windows for the applications on that desktop are displayed and the ones from the previous desktop are hidden. However, the desktop itself with whatever you put on it like widgets and icons is identical to all the other virtual desktops.\nIf you want the whole enchilada, then KDE has a feature called Activities. When you (create and then) switch activities, you get a whole new set of virtual desktops which can be setup completely independently from those of another activity with whatever icons and widgets you want for that activity.\nI have not used activities for a few years. They were a bit buggy back then, but I expect they are ready for prime time by now.\nKDE also has a login option to remember and restore any applications that were running on your desktops the last time you logged in. That way, you don't have set things up every time you log in. You can choose to have it start fresh, restore what was there previously, or start a predetermined set of applications every time.\n\nA: This worked for me, on Gnome 3.32\ngsettings set org.gnome.shell.app-switcher current-workspace-only true\n\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu along WindowsXP 32 bit I have Windows XP pro+Service Pack 3 (32 bit).I want to install ubuntu on my desktop along with windows XP .

Then, when you install Ubuntu from a DVD/USB, it will automatically detect this unallocated space and use it for the ext partition when you choose the \"install alongside\" option.\n2) Start Ubuntu installation from a DVD/USB, choose \"something else\". You will be redirected into the gnome GUI partitioning tool (gparted) which you can then use to resize the Win partition / create ext partition.\nI personally prefer to use Win tools on Win partitions, but that's not necessary.\nBe sure to allocate enough space to Ubuntu. You can resize the ext partition later but that may give you an extra headache of repairing a broken boot.\n", "Q: Wireless Broadcom BCM43228 on an Acer Aspire v5-571p does not work My built-in wireless card doesn't switch on.

It is in fact, a bog standard AHCI sata controller with special software built into the bios and a special driver for Windows to perform raid in software.  As such, there is no performance advantage over pure software raid, which is what you get when you set it up with the Ubuntu installer or disk utility.  The only reason to use the fake raid is if you must dual boot with Windows, since Windows will not recognize Linux software raid.  Otherwise, it is not as well supported as plain software raid, and so should be avoided.\n", "Q: After deleting some apps I can't pass the login screen I have applied Mac OS X theme to my Ubuntu 13.10, and then got bored adn tried to revert it.

I had installed it next to Windows 7 before on a similar device before and had not encountered any problems.\nFirstly, in the installation screens, Ubuntu wouldn't connect to the wifi, I thought this would clear up after I installed it however (it didn't). When I got to the partitioning screen it was a bit odd. The last time I installed Ubuntu it was divided into occupied space and free space, this time the hard drive was different. There were like 6 different partitions, something like Recovery, System Volume, sda/1, sda/2, sda/3, sda/4, sda/5. The majority of space was on sda/4 (something like 480 gb out of 500) so I clicked somethings and half of sda/4 split into sda/6. I chose to mount on sda/6 and the rest installed fine (although w/o internet)\nWhen I restarted the computer, it booted straight to Ubuntu without giving me an option to load Windows 8. The computer also wouldn't connect to the internet through wifi or Ethernet.\nTo try and fix the booting problem I burned the Boot Repair disk (I tried it twice) but both times it sort of just sat there. I'm not sure if I burned it incorrectly or something else. From what I've read something is supposed to come up quite easily, and it didn't. I also tried 'boot-repair' in the Terminal and that didn't work either. Due to the lack of internet apt-getting boot repair was also crossed off as an option\nI can post anything as needed (I'm not really sure what would help)\nmy flaccid boot repair:\n\n\nThank you in advance!\n\nA: Try preparing a USB flash drive or CD-R with my rEFInd boot manager. When you boot with that disk, you should get the rEFInd menu, which should enable you to boot either Windows or Linux. If this works, do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Linux using rEFInd.\n\n*Open a Terminal window.\n\n*In the Terminal, type sudo mkdir -p /boot/efi\n\n*In the Terminal, type sudo parted /dev/sda print.\n\n*Examine the output from parted to identify your EFI System Partition (ESP): It should have a FAT filesystem and the word \"boot\" under the \"Flags\" column. It's usually the first or second partition.\n\n*Mount the ESP to /boot/efi by typing sudo mount /dev/sda1 /boot/efi, changing /dev/sda1 to some other partition, if necessary.\n\n*Download the Debian-package version of rEFInd.\n\n*Install the Debian-package version of rEFInd by typing sudo dpkg -i refind_0.7.5-1_amd64.deb, changing the path to the file if necessary. (If somebody reads this in the future, the version number may be different, too.)\n\n*Reboot and enter your firmware setup utility. This is usually done by hitting Del or a function key as the computer powers up, but details depend on the computer.\n\n*Locate the option to support BIOS-mode (aka CSM or legacy) booting and disable it. Alternatively, there may be a boot order option that will enable you to set rEFInd to boot before the computer tries any sort of BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode boot. Unfortunately, options in firmware setup utilities vary greatly from one computer to another, so it's hard to be specific about what you should do.

Problem is I have a limited amount of space, so I can't create a file around the same size. Is there a way to actively delete lines that are sorted from File A?\nMy sort code: awk ' !x[$0]++' FileA.lst > FileB.lst\n\nA: Simple answer: consecutive duplicate lines\nFor in-place editing, sed is the tool of choice. To remove consecutive duplicate lines, use this:\n sed '$!N; /^\\(.*\\)\\n\\1$/!P; D'\n\nNot so simple: non-consecutive duplicate lines\nIf the duplicate lines are non-consecutive, you can use this -- but there's a risk of overflowing buffer space:\n sed -n 'G; s/\\n/&&/; /^\\([ -~]*\\n\\).*\\n\\1/d; s/\\n//; h; P'\n\nBecause sort uses the merge sort algorithm (assuming the GNU sort usually used on Linux), the risk of running out of memory or disk remains, because merge sort can use a lot of auxiliary space in worst-case situations. Aside from that risk, @thom is correct suggesting sort -u.\nIf the problem is to remove non-consecutive duplicate lines, and there's a risk that sed or an in-place sort might run out of space due to a worst-case situation, the best solution is probably to move the file to some sort of external storage, such as a USB flash drive.\nNote that if you don't know whether sed or sort might run out of space and corrupt your file, you really want to back up the file, one way or another. Another solution might be to sort through your filesystem for large files that can stand to be compressed, and compress enough of them to do the awk '!x[$0]++' inFile > outFile or sort -u safely, into a separate file. Then you don't lose data if the command fails.\nSee also \"Useful one-line scripts for sed\": http://sed.sourceforge.net/sed1line.txt\n\nA: As far as I know, the program  sort can sort 'inplace', that means that you can use the same file for input as for output. sort -u will remove duplicate lines.\nthe command would be:\nsort -u mylargefile mylargefile\n\nIt might, of course, be advisable to test it first on a smaller test file before you start doing the real thing. Especially if you don't have a backup of that 13 GB file\n", "Q: How to select option in \"Configuration grub-pc\" menu I would like to select /dev/sda in the \"Configuration grub-pc\" menu that popped up in my terminal while upgrading my distro version.

Then after much cautioning, the option remove_hiberfile is suggested. I would love that option. I don't care about the programs I had open, or the data in them. The windows partition is on /dev/sda5, so I ran\nsudo mount /dev/sda5 /mnt/win\n\nLots of reading later...\nsudo mount -t ntfs-3g -o remove_hiberfile /dev/sda5 /mnt/win\nsudo mount -t ntfs-3g -o debug,remove_hiberfile /dev/sda5 /mnt/win\n\nStill no luck. It's like the remove_hiberfile option isn't being recognized, because I don't get an error when trying to use the option remove_hiberfile3ejeiofe but rather the same message.\nThis is the message given as a result of all above commands (adding debug did not change anything):\nThe disk contains an unclean file system (0, 0).\nMetadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount.\nFailed to mount '/dev/sda5': Operation not permitted\nThe NTFS partition is in an unsafe state. Please resume and shutdown\nWindows fully (no hibernation or fast restarting), or mount the volume\nread-only with the 'ro' mount option.\n\nI am able to mount read-only, but that doesn't help me much.\n\nA: To delete hiberfil.sys, you have to use the command prompt to manually turn off hibernation. \nBoot from the Windows 7 DVD, and press Shift+F10 at the language selection screen, and Boot to the System Recovery Options screen, and select the Command Prompt. \nTo turn off or disable hibernation, type the following command at the prompt:\npowercfg –h off\n\nThis will disable hibernation and will remove the hiberfil.sys file from your system.\n\nA: I had same problem. Try:\nntfsfix /dev/sda5\n\nremove_hiberfile option no longer works.\nntfs-3g package policy is to use the new tool ntfsfix.\nHowever, this tool didn't work for me either. So I plugged the hard disk in a Windows machine, turned off \"Fast Startup\" in power button options from within Windows, then shutdown and replaced back the HDD in my Ubuntu machine.\nI found about it here: Using Ubuntu To Delete hiberfil.sys From Unbootable Win 8.1\n\nA: Read the error again. Just the second line which reads:\nError mounting /dev/sdXY…\n\nNote the /dev/sdXY thing. XY should be replaced with the error you see in your system. Now open terminal and use the following command:\nsudo ntfsfix /dev/sdXY\n\nwhere XY is the troublesome partition shown in the error. For example sda2 or sdb1 or sda5 (as in picture above). ntfsfix is already installed in Ubuntu systems.\n\nA: I have run into this problem several times before as well. Recently I had 2 hard drives, one previously running Windows 8 which I got sick of and reformatted and a 2TB storage drive I had been using with Windows 8.\nAs I had removed Windows 8, had no Windows installation media and had no plans on reinstalling it any time soon, removing the fast and hybrid boot options was not an alternative.\nI tried to mount it with the remove_hiberfile option with no luck, still the same error message. Tried mounting as read only then remounting (sudo mount -o remount,rw  ) which at first seemed to give me write access, but none of the changes I made were actually written to disk (removed files in nautilus reappeared).\nThe solution I finally found was to use GParted to move the affected partition to another location on the hard drive, changing the amount of bytes preceding and following the partition. I suspect it rewrites the partition table along with metadata/hibernation flag. I'm glad my guess turned out to work because moving the 1.6TB partition took 19 hours!\nThere must be a simpler solution though, as I've found other Linux distros I've used don't have the same hesitation to mounting hibernated drives. Maybe the module that checks for the flag can be turned off or replaced? Better yet, giving a damn about the flag should be a couple of choices (mount as read only, mount as read/write, the latter + remove flag etc) and not just an error message.\nAnyhow, hope someone else in the same situation will find this information useful.\n\nA: I've just had this problem where I removed Windows 8 so couldn't turn off hibernation. I tried to use remove_hiberfile and it didn't work. However because this is just a storage drive, under the \"Disks\" application, I edited the partition and unchecked bootable. Now I can mount the drive. Hope this helps someone else.\n\nA: Moving the -o to the end worked for me:\nmount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda5 /mnt/win -o remove_hiberfile \n\n(Ubuntu 16.04 live cd and a vanilla windows 7)\n\nA: On a Lenovo 710 desktop with ssd (UEFI) for the operating system and a hard drive for other stuff, I installed ubuntu (not as duel boot) and could not access my hard drive due to the error described above. However, rebooting while hitting F2 brought me to a recover option for windows. I declined the recovery, and on the next screen responded that I wanted to \"exit windows\".

I had this set up before on CrunchBang and they all three just showed as one device but for some reason on Ubuntu I can only get sda and sdb to show as one device and sdc shows as a separate device.

I want to download ubuntu in place of Windows 8. I am just curious as to what happens to my saved data upon installation of ubuntu. Will my files be present after installation?\n\nA: When you go in for installing Ubuntu (applies to all the versions), you have 3 options that may be considered\n1.Install Alongside Windows\nHere, the bootloader reads your disks, checks for other OSes and basically displays what you can install Ubuntu with. In this case, all your data is preserved and you will not lose any saved data.\n2.Remove Everything and install Ubuntu\nIn this case you will lose all your data. Everything, the LiveUSB shall format all your drives and you will have a machine with Ubuntu only. Your data that is linked with Windows will be formated\n3.Something Else\nHere, you have an option of how much space you want to allocate, to which disk, swap space, everything. Total customization is available via this option. Now in this option you may or may not lose data. It depends on how you choose to create your new partitions really. \nSo this is how these options work. Hope you have a successful installation!\n\nA: You can install Ubuntu over windows completely overriding the windows files. If you do this, backup everything before the install. Or you could install it alongside Windows and it will give an option to partition your HDD so you can use both.

As minerz029 said, you can just use Startup Disk Creator. It should already be installed. \nTo find it, press the Super key (looks like the Windows icon) and type in \"Startup Disk Creator\" at the top.  \nThen, afterwards, everything should be pretty straightforward.

Only windows works now. Went into the Update manager had selected the option to have it inform me of all updates including non-LTS versions, and that finally got it to work.....or at least it looked as if it was going to work, but it failed (this being the 2nd time it did that, tried updating via command line at first before trying it this way)\nI have no idea what happened tho. It was going fine, and I got up to get something to drink, prolly took like 5min, came back, and my Laptop was off, and now it won't boot in Ubuntu. tried going into recovery and having it check the filesystem, and \"repair broken  packages\" to no avail. They both finish, then once it tries to boot into Ubuntu, I just get a black screen and it stays like that until i hard-reset. \nI've been trying to figure this out since yesterday morning, and am about to just delete it and start fresh, luckily everything was already backed-up, but Figured I would ask here and see if anyone had any other ideas before I wipe it and start over. \n\nA: I still can't figure out what to do.

My Ubuntu install is not detecting my Windows 7. Some say I need to convert it from MBR to GPT or the other way around. So when I try to zap my drive with gdisk through the terminal, it gives me a warning that it might be destructive or something.\nThese are the commands I use:\nsudo gdisk /dev/sda\nz\n\nWhat should I do? Could this erase everything I have on the disk?\nEDIT: So when I type sudo gdisk /dev/sdc it comes up with a warning that says that I have no GPT partition table, and converting MBR to GPT is \"potentially destructive\". \nThen it asks if I want to continue. So is it destructive? What does this even mean?\n\nA: Note: Always keep in mind that when dealing with anything to do with partitions, make sure that you have a current backup, in case something goes wrong.\nGdisk is a disk partitioning tool, and it can erase your disk if not careful.  It is designed to create, modify, and erase partitions.  As far as converting MBR to GPT and GPT to MBR, keep reading.\nOne of the more unusual features of gdisk is its ability to read an MBR partition table and convert it to GPT format without damaging the contents of the partitions on the disk. \nThis feature exists to enable upgrading to GPT in case the limitations of MBRs.\nIn addition to converting to GPT format, GPT fdisk supports converting from GPT format to MBR format. This feature, though, comes with some caveats: Depending on how the disk was originally partitioned, it may not be possible to convert all the original partitions. Even if converting all the partitions is possible, there may be restrictions on which partitions can be turned into logical partitions, which may in turn result in some odd or undesirable assignments to primary vs. logical partitions in the final MBR partition table.\nUnfortunately, a complete conversion from GPT to MBR is tricky.Gdisk\nNote: Always keep in mind that when dealing with anything to do with partitions, make sure that you have a current backup, in case something goes wrong.\n", "Q: How to restore Windows boot option in grub2 I used to have two harddrives sda (Ubuntu 12.04LTS) and sdb (Window 7). I used grub2 to boot between both of them.\nThen, I did a clean install of Ubuntu 13.10 on sda replacing the old Ubuntu version.

Do I need to revert back to a previous boot mechanism prior UEFI (which one?)? What would be of interest to debug this?\nsdb1 is the boot partition of Windows 7 (ntfs)\nMy Linux partitions are encrypted.\n\nA: Grub2 should be able to find windows using sudo update-grub. If that does not work, maybe your partition table is damaged and you should use a livecd or a tool like super grub disk to recover it.\nMore info: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1657134\nEdit: You cannot have both OS with different boot system.

I have my /home directory on a separate partition, so all my files and settings etc. are right where they are. This also meant I now have Evince 3.10. On Lubuntu 13.04, I think I had Evince 3.8 (not sure), but it had a menubar and a toolbar. I've hidden the toolbar, but the menubar was still available.\nNow, when I open a pdf, I see neither the toolbar nor the menubar. I learnt that the menubar has been removed in favor of a more powerful toolbar in Evince 3.10, but couldn't find anything on the net as to why my toolbar is hidden. Then, I noticed that if I go fullscreen with F11 and back with ESC, the toolbar shows up. But again disappears as soon as I click on the pdf page.\nSo, I thought I'd try and clear all the evince settings, but I couldn't find much. There is no ~/.config/evince. The only thing that I found seems to be related to this problem is ~/.local/share/gvfs-metadata. If I clear out that folder, and open a pdf, the toolbar shows up correctly and behaves right. Until I close it and open it again that is. If evince saves a file called home in that directory, then the next time I open the pdf, the toolbar is gone. If I clear the folder again, the toolbar appears.\nI'm not sure if all this is intentional, but if that is the case, all I want is how do I summon the toolbar when its hidden, when I need to check the page number I'm in, for example.\nThank you for any help with this.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install dconf-editor\n\n*Follow path /org/gnome/evince/default/, check show-toolbar\n\nA: You can always install install atril.

And it works perfectly!\nThere were some issues with installation because of UEFI and with Nvidia videocard, but I solved them all quite easily with use of some standard manuals on those topics.\nThe only issue I couldn't solve was installing Ubuntu in UEFI mode, so I had to switch to classic mode in BIOS.

The attendees recognise that Nautilus is still the best all-round file manager available for Ubuntu and as such it makes sense to use it.\nThe coming months will see definitie decisions taken on the issues raised.\nBut for now we can feel assured that the loss of shortcuts, functionality, accessibility, and Ubuntu integration are being taken seriously.\n\n\nSo no, Nautilus is there to stay for a while.

As iBall3.5G is working on WinXP(SP3)\nwe can extract IDs from the log generated by iBall Connection manager.\nWhen you connect using iBall connection manager on WinXP(SP3), USB message exchanged are logged.

We need to capture the switch event, remember?\nStep 7:\nRun SniffUSB.exe - remember with administrator rights.\nPlug in dongle, you'll see something like below.\n\nYou can see Default(Vendor, Product) IDs listed.\nSelect the one which came after dongle plug in & click install filter. It's hidden behind that password prompt, something like this:\n\nStep 8:\nRemove the dongle & plugin again.\nNow that we enabled(installed) a filter specific to our iBall3.5G, SniffUSB should dump packets exchanged.\nGo ahead & install iBall connection manager & Drivers as usual.\nStep 9:\nBy the time installation is finished size of UsbSnoop.log bloats to ~40 MB.

It goes straight from the motherboard splash screen to Windows 7's \"Starting Windows\" screen. Then to Windows 7.\nI've tried seemingly everything. Tweaking nearly every setting in the BIOS (boot order, USB-related-anything). Holding F8, F11 or F12 while booting. Trying different USB ports. Unplugging all other USB devices. Even attempting it with a second USB drive. I've read all of the articles and forum posts online. Nothing is working.\nI didn't have this problem before. It was on this machine that I first replaced Windows with Ubuntu. And without any substantial hurdles.\nNow, I'm on a fresh install of Windows 7 (work-related). It is on its own partition -- 250 GB of 500 GB. I left the remaining 250 GB unallocated, so that I could install Ubuntu there.\nOne thought I originally had was to buy a second hard drive (500 GB) on which to install Windows. Except as it is, I don't even know how I'll be able to format the existing one for Ubuntu use, without being able to boot from a USB stick.\nAnd, when I open Wubi, I notice that it can only install Ubuntu on a partition of my Windows partition. Not what I'm looking to do.\nMy motherboard is an Asus M4A78LT-M LE (http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/M4A78LTM_LE/). However, I don't see how it could be the culprit, considering I previously installed Ubuntu on it successfully. It seems like it's something Windows 7-related.\nIs there a certain key that can be held down that will make a motherboard force-boot from a USB drive? Any other help? What can I do?\nThank you.\n\nA: I don't think it's related to Windows 7. Windows doesn't have control over your boot process. \nWubi is meant for installing Ubuntu within the Windows partition, and as you said, this is not what you are looking for.\nIn what way did you create this USB stick with Ubuntu? It sounds like it might not be bootable.\nThe manual for your motherboard says to press F8 when the Asus logo is showing, to display a menu of bootable devices.

And I have disabled secure boot and fast boot in UEFI. Any other option also ends with black screen.\nIt's possible that MSI's UEFI implementation is preventing me from installing Ubuntu.\nI have a GeForce GTX 765M GPU. Maybe this will help you.\nThe only Linux distribution I can install without getting a black screen is Arch Linux, but it is hard for me to install it, and also, I need to later transform Arch to Ubuntu if there is no other way of getting Ubuntu installed on my laptop.\n\nA: The power consumption of the GeForce GTX 765M GPU in your MSI GE60 gaming laptop should be between 50 and 75 Watts! That's a lot of power and it could definitely make USB boot go to hell. The GPU has 3GB of built-in RAM. That could cause booting problems as well. Your GPU could be sucking power from the USB flash drive. If the USB port is not getting enough power, then almost any live distro that you try to run from the USB will freeze.\nAnd what's strange about it is that if the distro is really lightweight it WON'T freeze. GParted live USB won't freeze. Clonezilla live USB won't freeze. SOMETIMES Xubuntu live USB won't freeze (and sometimes it will freeze anyway) and also Lubuntu live USB. Well, I said \"SOMETIMES\", although Lubuntu live USB black screens on your laptop too.\n\nI read your post about getting Arch to boot on your laptop, and based on this I made a special Ubuntu 13.10 minimal install CD and got it to boot successfully on a machine that couldn't boot from a normal Ubuntu live USB. Then I booted from the Ubuntu 13.10 mini CD and tested it in Rescue Mode without installing Ubuntu. Then I exited from Rescue Mode by aborting the Rescue Mode startup at the language selection window and clicked to shutdown the computer normally. Here are the steps I followed:\n\n*\n\n*Downloaded the Ubuntu 13.10 64-bit Mini CD iso file from the link on the Ubuntu Documentation Installation Minimal CD webpage. You should select the Ubuntu 13.10 iso file, not the 13.04 iso, so that you can upgrade your operating system to the next Long Term Support version of Ubuntu, Ubuntu 14.04, when it is released in April 2014. I downloaded the file called mini.iso to my Downloads folder.\n\n\n*Verified the md5 checksum of the Ubuntu mini CD iso file that I downloaded by running these commands:\n cd ~/Downloads/\n md5sum 'mini.iso'\n\nThen I checked that the results of the command matched the MD5 checksum of the mini.iso file on the Ubuntu Documentation Installation Minimal CD webpage.\n\n\n*Got a USB flash drive, 1GB or larger. Deleted all the files from the USB flash drive. I unmounted the flash drive using the Disks disk utility. The package name of the Disks disk utility is gnome-disk-utility\n\n\n*Checked in Disks disk utility to find out the device name of my USB flash drive. This is very important because if you use the wrong device name in step 5, you will overwrite your whole operating system instead of writing to the USB flash drive. So check the USB flash drive device name twice.  It should be something like /dev/sd* where instead of the * character there is a lower case letter. The device name of my flash drive was /dev/sdc.\n\n\n*Opened the terminal and ran the following commands:\n cd ~/Downloads/  \n sudo su  \n dd if='mini.iso' of=/dev/sdc bs=4096  \n\nThese are the commands I used to write the Ubuntu 13.10 64-bit mini.iso file to my USB flash drive. The dd if='mini.iso' of=/dev/sdc bs=4096 command took less than 9 seconds to complete on my computer because the mini.iso is a small file, only 36MB. The result of running this command was a bootable Ubuntu 13.10 64-bit mini CD. I checked the USB flash drive in GParted to check if it was bootable. GParted did not recognize the boot flag on my flash drive, but the USB flash drive was indeed bootable as I found out in the following step.\n\n\n*Booted the computer from the Ubuntu 13.10 mini live USB. The Ubuntu 13.10 mini live USB booted successfully and showed a menu screen.\n\n\n*From the menu screen pressed the F1 key to bring up the Help menu.\n\n\n*From the Help menu I selected the option for Rescue Mode, because I wanted to test the Ubuntu 13.10 mini live USB without installing anything.\n\n\n*The Rescue Mode started successfully. I clicked on the Back button at the first screen and then on the Yes button when it asked me if I wanted to abort and then I clicked to shutdown the computer normally.\nNow I have a working bootable Ubuntu 13.10 mini live USB. Since your laptop can boot the Arch minimal CD, it is very likely that it can also boot the Ubuntu 13.10 mini live USB. Select the Install option (not the command-line install, the complete install) from the menu screen in Step 6. The Ubuntu installer will start installing Ubuntu, and it will prompt you when you need to make a selection or type information about your Ubuntu installation. When you restart the system at the end of the installation, you will have a working Ubuntu desktop with the default desktop environment.\n", "Q: How do I recursively zip all subfolders in a directory?

Starting yesterday the drive wouldn't auto-mount anymore and when I tried navigating to it I got this error message\nError mounting: mount exited with exit code 13: ntfs_attr_pread_i: ntfs_pread failed: > Input/output error\nFailed to read NTFS $Bitmap: Input/output error\nNTFS is either inconsistent, or there is a hardware fault, or it's a\nSoftRAID/FakeRAID hardware.

If the device is a SoftRAID/FakeRAID then first activate\nit and mount a different device under the /dev/mapper/ directory, (e.g.\n/dev/mapper/nvidia_eahaabcc1). Please see the 'dmraid' documentation\nfor more details.\n\nNow, I'm not sure if the drive is formatted using NTFS. Anyway, I followed the suggestion, booted into Windows and tried running chkdsk /f, but Windows couldn't read the drive either, I got Data error (cyclic redundancy check).

That is may be the simplest way to do it, if the most expensive - but mucking around with 1.5 Terabytes of data could be rather difficult - particurally with input/output errors.\n\nThis is sort of referring to past experience, where my 1 Terabyte Hitachi drive I used to store videos on failed after a month, and it turned out to be the external USB enclosure that was the problem. I eventually sorted it out for myself last week, but I only recovered a 1/4 of the data, and only 3/4 of the disk now works. I can now still use it though - but not for anything important.\nBut I do have one or two 'tips':\n\n\n*\n\n*If it is important, backup the backup - and don't use massive hard drives or partitions for backing up\n\n*Check the disk occasionally (GParted is usually competent at that)\n\n*'Safely Remove Drive' before unpluggin it\n\n*Never let the computer suspend when it is plugged in (that is what killed mine)\nSorry, thats it \n", "Q: How to uninstall Comodo Antivirus in Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit?

Save the changes. You should now be able to access Webmin through the standard web address.\nGo into the Webmin Configuration page and add the new port you want to access through in the \"Listen on IP's and ports:\" section; leave the standard port 10000 open for now - you can add a second port in the settings. Make sure the \"Open new ports in firewall\" box is checked. Save the changes and try accessing Webmin through the new port. If that works, you can remove the port 10000 entry and use the new port.\nIf you are going to be accessing Webmin from outside of your LAN, make sure to add a port forwarding rule in your router for the new port.\n\nA: If I remember correctly, webmin uses port 10000. If you're running webmin on localhost you would have to enter the address localhost:10000 in the address bar of the browser.\nIf you are accessing a different computer you switch out localhost with that computer's IP address.

I made the partition for ubuntu in disc management, and I have also made the live usb. When i put the live usb into my laptop and boot up, windows just boots up normally instead of going to the live usb....\nhelp! \n\nA: You have to select it to boot up - disable Secure Boot in BIOS (like a hardware settings thing before Windows boots up), and allow booting from USB. There is a helpful guide here.\n\nSave your changes, and power off and on again - then select 'Boot Device Menu' or something similar, and then the USB or Disc entry under the manufacturer of the USB stick or disk drive.\n\n\nA: Windows8 normal shut-down is not a complete shut-down but rather an \"enhanced\" form of hibernation (especially on new laptops, in order to facilitate faster boot times.) To perform a \"proper\" complete shut-down you have to keep the shift key pressed while shutting down windows. The next time you power-up the computer will obey the preferred boot device sequence (assuming you have made the desired modifications through the BIOS setup.)\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu to dual boot with windows 8.1, windows not recognized during install I am currently trying to install ubuntu 13.10 to dual-boot with windows 8.1 on my laptop.

I have been wanting to switch from Windows to Linux for years now, but couldn't decide on a flavor. Today I got fed up with Windows 7 and just picked one--Ubuntu.\nI know Linux has different terms and the file system is a little different. Right now I am trying to find the Linux equivalent of the root directory. My external drives all have their proper names, but the C: drive's name apparently was changed. I would like to change it back, if possible.\nIs there a glossary or something that can be used?\n\nA: Windows and Linux have very different partition naming conventions. \nFirst C: Drive is not a whole disk drive but just one partition. In Linux, drives are often referred to as /dev/sda, /dev/sdb etc. The partitions inside the drives are indicated by the numbered suffix, such as /dev/sda1. /dev/sda2 etc. \nSecond, the partitioned need to be mounted before they can be used in Linux. The place where they are mounted are called mount points. A special mount point is /, or the root of the file system. This mount point is reserved for Ubuntu system partition, the rough equivalent of Windows C:\\\nThird, other non-system partitions can be mounted anywhere as in a folder or sub-folder. For example, if you have a partition for music files, you could mount it in your home folder like /home/[userID]/Music. \nFourth, if your C:\\ partition has a name, Ubuntu will try to use that name to mount that partition. If not, you can make Ubuntu mount it folder that you name. For example, you can create a folder /media/OldStinkyC_Drive and mount your C:\\ partition there! Note, unlike Windows everything in Ubuntu is case sensitive. \nHere is a reference of DOS to Linux commands: \nhttp://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/unix_for_dos_users.html\nHope this helps\n\nA: I've found these DOS-to-Linux Terminal cheat sheets, hope they help!:\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.junauza.com/2009/11/dos-to-unixlinux-translation-dos-to.html\n\n*http://www-uxsup.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/doc/redhat/redhat6.2/gsg-62/ch-doslinux.html\nIn order to better understand how the Terminal syntax works, I recommend this page:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal\nJust a curiosity: if you eventually get used to the Linux commands and see yourself in a situation where you're using both DOS and Linux, you might want to find out how to run the Linux terminal on Windows before you start smashing keyboards.

I was wrong.\nHow can I access them and transfer them to Ubuntu?\n\nA: Assuming you chose to install Ubuntu alongside Windows during instalation (if you chose to erase Windows and dedicate your whole HD to Ubuntu, you have a different problem): \nUbuntu (or pretty much any Linux-based OS) reads Windows files without a problem. You just need to open your file browser (in a fresh installation, it should look like a file-cabinet icon to the left of your screen), search for your Windows partition (look under \"Devices\", on the left part of the Files window), click it and go find your files. They should be under /users/<your user name>/ (note there's no such thing as C: in Linux, it has a different way of naming partitions). Copying those files to your Ubuntu partition is as easy as it is under Windows: you can click-and-drag a rectangle around the desired files and drag them to your \"Home\" folder (top of Files left panel). Of course, Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V also work as expected.\n", "Q: Dual boot Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu I have an HP Envy Dv7 with Windows 8 installed from the factory and recently upgraded to Windows 8.1. \nI have dual booted Windows and Ubuntu on my last Windows 7 laptop, but now I can´t figure it out.

I was trying to connect to a hidden Wi-Fi network with WPA2 Security and I noticed there is no way to connect to it from the Network Manager. I can't connect to the internet without Wi-Fi so I can't download any programs to do it and I was wondering if there is a way to connect at all.\n\nA: Check if your wifi have been recognized by the system, by opening a Terminal, and typing:\nsudo ifconfig -a \nThere should be an eth0, and an lo interface. And most importantly, an another, wlan0, or similar.\nIf you are missing the extra plus one interface, we found the problem.  \nAs I said in the comment earlier, you either need a firmware, which the system will automatically download... once you connect to the internet. Or, your wireless card is not supported at all.  \nSolution?\nGet some wired internet from somewhere, or even bluetooth tethering could work I guess.\nBut you can also Google your $wireless chip and linux keywords in Google.\n\nA: A useful workaround is: add your network manually to networks list and then in console execute\nsudo iwlist wlan0 scan essid myessidname\n\nReplacing myessidname (and perhaps wlan0) with your network name/interface\nNow it appears in the list and you may connect.\n", "Q: Where i can find information about updates Some minutes ago I gained \"restar to updates take effect\"(don't remember exectly the words).

You can see changes made with:\ncd /var/log/apt\ncat history.log\n\nDepending on how long since the upgrade, the relevant entries may have been compressed to save space. The /var/log/apt directory will contain archived log files named history.log.X.gz where larger values of X mean older log files. You can read the compressed log files using zcat without needing to manually uncompress them:\ncd /var/log/apt\nzcat history.log.1.gz\n\nYou should see lines like\nUpgrade: package1:arch (oldversion, newversion), package2:arch (oldversion, newversion)...\n\nfrom which it should be fairly easy to see what was upgraded recently.\n", "Q: How to reinstall services?

That might work, not that this is the most convenient way to go... \nAssuming that the ubuntu menu shut down really isn't working and that the shell command does, you can do the following to have a more natural seeming shut down situation. \n\n\n*\n\n* First open a terminal and change directory to /usr/local/bin: \n\n\ncd /usr/local/bin\n\n\n\n\n\n*Next open your favorite text editor as root (lets say gedit)  and create a file called shutdown.sh:\n    \n    sudo gedit shutdown.sh\n\n\ntype the following in shutdown.sh:\n\n    #! /bin/bash\n    shutdown -h now\n\nSave and quit gedit \n\n\n* Next make the script executable by doing\n    sudo chmod 755 shutdown.sh \n\n\n\n* Now in the terminal type \n    sudo visudo\nThis will open a text file in the terminal. Near the bottom of the document you will see the following\n     \n     # Allow members of group sudo to execute any command\n     %sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n     \n\nBelow this line add the line :\n    \n    yourUserName ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/shutdown.sh\n    \n\n where \"yourUserName\" should be replaced by your actual user name. This step tells sudo to execute shutdown.sh without requiring your password.   \n\n\n\n* Since you created shutdown.sh as root, root should be the owner of the file  It is very important that this is the case , since we told sudo that running shutdown.sh does not require a password, anyone who could edit shutdown.sh could put any command they wanted in there, effectively gaining root privileges to your machine without needing your password. You can double check these settings by\n\n    ls -l shutdown.sh\n\nYou should see something like:\n\n    -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 28 Dec  1 17:57 shutdown.sh\n\n\nthe first \"root is the owner, the second is the group name. If for some reason yours doesn't match do :\n    \n    sudo chown root:root shutdown.sh\n    \n\n\n* Now we need to create a .desktop file to allow us to view shut down in the dashboard and launcher like all other apps. First we should cd to somewhere where you have write privileges lets say your home directory \n\n cd ~ \n\n\n\nPut the following in a file called shutdown.desktop\n\n\n[Desktop Entry] \nVersion=1.0 \nType=Application  \nName=Shut Down \nComment=Turn the computer off \nIcon=/usr/share/icons/Humanity-Dark/actions/16/system-shutdown-panel-restart.svg \nExec=sudo /usr/local/bin/shutdown.sh \nTerminal=false \n\n\nYou can of course change the name and comment to anything you want. You can also pick whatever icon you want, I found this one in the /usr/share/icons directory and it seems ok. I'm pretty sure that your icon needs to be in .svg format though.\n\nNow change permissions on the file by \n\n sudo chmod 755 shutdown.desktop \n\n If you put this file on your Desktop it will give you a little button to shut the computer down.

On the Live usb I opened up GParted to format that unallocated space into ext 4. The problem is I have four primary partitions already and cannot make another primary partition. The four partitions are labeled sda1 SYSTEM, sda2  with no label, sda3 RECOVERY, and sda4 HP_TOOLS. I am new to this area, but would love to try Ubuntu and this has thrown me a curveball. I am not quite sure what to do from here.\n\nA: You could try using EaseUS partition manager to convert one of your primary partition to extended logical (by Mitch in reply to How to change primary partition to extended without formatting). \nYou would then shrink the logical partition, and create the partitions for your Ubuntu installation. For an Ubuntu installation you'll need at least one partition (ext4/ext3/ext2) for the root ( / ) partition (at least 5GB, at most 30GB). A swap partition of size equal to or up to 3 times the size of your RAM is recommended (if you're short on RAM).\n\nA: The vast majority of computers that come with Windows 8 pre-installed use the GUID Partition Table (GPT), which doesn't suffer from a 4-primary-partition limit. In fact, GPT doesn't make a distinction between primary, extended, and logical partitions; you've just got \"partitions\" (with no qualifier), although GParted and some other tools insist on applying the \"primary\" adjective to GPT partitions.\nIf you've installed Windows 8 yourself or adjusted it to boot in BIOS mode with MBR partitions, though, you'll have that issue. You may be able to work around it by using FixParts (included in the Ubuntu gdisk package) to convert one partition to logical form. This will also create an extended partition, which you'll be able to resize and then create new logical partitions within the extended partition. There are caveats and limits to what FixParts can do, though. Read its Web page for details.\n", "Q: Printing canceled \"Bond Types Inquiry Lab\" on MG2200-series, whenever I try to print I have a Canon MG2220 printer and am having trouble printing.

If I move very slowly down and to the right, it will follow me very slowly: down and to the right.\nHowever on Ubuntu, if I move slowly down and to the right, it seems to randomly jump pixels. Rather than tracking perfectly, every once in a while (quite frequently) it appears to jump like 8 pixels (a small but noticeable amount). This means when I drag slowly down and to the right, it will periodically jump further than it should.\nThe problem is, this jitter is extremely noticeable when I try to use left click (my mousepad has soft button areas). So when I want to click a link, my thumb touches the mousepad to begin the click, and the mouse jitters, and causes me to click-and-drag a lot, or just completely miss what I was trying to click.\nI've tinkered with all of the settings I could find and nothing seems to make any impact whatsoever on this. \nSettings I've tried:\nsynclient----\nFingerLow\nFingerHigh\nMinSpeed\nMaxSpeed\nAccelFactor\nHorizHysteresis\nVertHysteresis\nAreaBottomEdge\nxinput on SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad----\nTwo-Finger Pressure\nSoft Button Areas\nNoise Cancellation\nThe only setting that made ANY impact at all was AreaBottomEdge, but the problem was that it didn't actually do what I wanted to.\nSo it stops tracking movements on the bottom part of my laptop (ie essentially disabling tracking on the 'soft-button area' depending what I set the value to). However when two fingers are on the trackpad, it still tracks my thumb in that area which causes it to jitter when I try to click.\nAny and all help is appreciated. This is driving me crazy.\n\nAnybody?\nThis seems to be an incredibly common issue on linux with synaptics touchpads.\nI'm not sure why nobody has made better drivers. I'm sure it's preventing a lot of notebook users from switching to linux (or at the very least discouraging them).\nI suppose I shouldn't complain too much unless I am ready to write those drivers myself. Nevertheless, for an organization like Ubuntu, you'd think somebody would get delegated the task of making the operating system efficiently usable with a touchpad.\n\nA: You could try enabling noise cancellation. First run xinput to find the id of your touchpad device. \n$ xinput\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣   ↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad                id=13   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\nAs you can see, my id is 13.\nTo set noise cancellation run\nxinput set-prop 13 'Synaptics Noise Cancellation' 30 30\n\nWhere 13 is the id of your pointer device. You can vary the numbers 30 30 (they define the sides of the 'noise cancellation box') to find something that suits you.\nIf this works, you might want set that command to run automatically on login and/or boot. Startup Applications -> Add -> enter the xinput-command in the 'command' text field.\nMore info:\nhttp://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man4/synaptics.4.html\n\nA: By default the Synaptics driver isn't installed, and the default driver from libinput is used, which doesn't have noise filtering.\nYou can often solve this issue by simply installing xserver-xorg-input-synaptics:\nsudo apt install xserver-xorg-input-synaptics\n\nOnce rebooted, it'll activate automatically. The default 'Synaptics Noise Cancellation' value of 29 should provide adequate amount of jitter filtering, but if it doesn't, you can always increase it (see the other answer).\n", "Q: How to check which version of KVM I am running?

If it works, the problem is not with your sudo. Check your release upgrade settings under System Settings -> Software and Sources. If the problem is with sudo, move on to step 2.\n\n*If it returns the same problem, check if you are a sudoer. Log into a sudoer account or become root using su, and run adduser <username> sudo. If this does not solve the problem, move on to step 3.\n\n*As your user account, run passwd and try setting your password again to make sure the problem is not with your password.\n\nA: If you run upgrade you should add -d.

When I go to Firefox, it say \"server not found\". I try different websites, I go the same thing. I have my Ethernet cable plug in right, when I plug the Ethernet cable to a Windows computer the internet works fine. \n\nA: First of all you need to figure it out what's causing the problem. You may try in your browser to access a website not by a domain name, but by ip, ex: instead of google.com you could write 74.125.225.8 and if in this case it will work means that the problem is in the DNS. Otherwise you could see the configuration of your network interfaces by issuing the command ifconfig or ifconfig eth0 if assuming that your Ethernet card is eth0.\nIn order to find the dns server assigned to your server issue this command: nmcli dev list | grep DNS.

After searching here, I found no direct answer to:\nIs it practical to put swap on a USB Flash drive?  I do not yet know if the teeny-tiny flash drive (Fit CZ33 ) I wish to use runs at high-speed (480 Mbps), full-speed (12 Mbps), or low-speed (1.5 Mbps), but am checking w/ SanDisk. \nMy intent is to reduce writes on the SSD for drive longevity; if the external flashdrive fails, I throw it away and get another. \nWhy? Because I just changed my ThinkPad R60 9459AT8 over to a Samsung SSD after maxing out the RAM at 3GB, set up trim after repartitioning with 20% free, removed swap, set swappiness to 0 and otherwise tuned up Xubuntu 13.10 for SSD. However, since it's not practical for me to add a mechanical HDD, I'd like to move the swap over to a Flashdrive which will always stay in the left side USB2 socket, for I'dather wear out a $12 flashdrive instead of a $180 SSD. \nWhy? Sometimes, I lose my WiFi connection until I reboot, plus rarely see slowdown, and I'd like to see if having swap again would help. I do watch a system monitor always in a panel and never exceed 30% free memory use, but would like to have swap without putting in on the SSD.\nYea, or nay?\nAnd, does the size of the flashdrive make any difference: 8GB, 16GB or 32GB? \n\nA: Flash drives are slower. \nMy SSD is older and half the speed of newer systems and my system is all SATA2 and USB2.\nsudo hdparm -t /dev/sdd4\n\n\nolder SSD drive: \n  Timing buffered disk reads: 626 MB in  3.01 seconds = 208.20 MB/sec\nOlder 160GB rotating drive:\n  Timing buffered disk reads: 212 MB in  3.01 seconds =  70.46 MB/sec\nUSB2 flash drive\n  Timing buffered disk reads:  50 MB in  3.07 seconds =  16.26 MB/sec\n\nOr my flash drive is only 10% as fast for reading as my slow SSD. And writes are notoriously slow on flash drives.\nYou can set swappiness to use RAM first.\ncat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness\ngksudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nAdd this:\nvm.swappiness=10\n\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq#What_is_swappiness_and_how_do_I_change_it.3F\nThere is the swapspace or dynamic swap manager.

The downside is that regular and sequential read/writes to the USB drive decrease the life of the drive itself. It is not as good as having proper RAM but at least it is far better than having Swap on the HDD. \nTo do so, delete all files uon the USB flash drive, so plug it in and unmount it by-\nsudo umount /media/sdb1\n\nto watch the disk label as we have used here sdb1 (yours might be different). Yse the following and make sure which one is your USB flash drive with the consideration of size, and sdb1 is just used here for exampling and explaining  -\nsudo fdisk -l\n\nNow create swap on your USB flash drive by-\nsudo mkswap /dev/sdb1\n\nturn it on with \nsudo swapon -p 32767 /dev/sdx1\n\nto check it works\ncat /proc/swaps\n\nwhich will show both your swap on your booting drive and the USB Flash Drive as well.\n", "Q: How do I start the Privacy and Activity Manager from command line?

It seems like a lot of people don't know this essential skill of Linux--so it's time to learn:)\n\nA: Many of the less-popular applications for Linux systems don't ship as deb or rpm packages; in face, most ship as source files, usually in a tar archive. The first thing to do if you want to install one of these programs is to navigate to the directory where you downloaded the archive using the cd command. Once there, extract the archive with:\ntar -xfv filename.tar.x\n\nwhere filename.tar.x is the name of the downloaded archive. The -x option indicates that you want to extract the archive and -f indicates that you want to unarchive a file. -v tells tar that you want a verbose list of the files it extracts; this command could be run without it, you just wouldn't get a list of all the files that are unarchived.\nNext you need to run the configuration script, for most applications. Some applications have special instructions, so you should skim the README file first, which you can do by navigating to the extracted directory and typing ls, which will list the files in the directory. Assuming that the readme file is named README as most are, just type nano README to read it (ctrl+x to exit.)\nTo run the configuration scripts, first navigate to the extracted directory (if not already there) and type ls to view a list of files. You should see a file named configure or config, which may or may not have a file extension. Type:\n./configurefile.name\n\nwhere configurefile.name is the name of the file with its extension, if present. This will usually just be ./configure. Depending on your distro, you may need a sudo or a su or a # before the ./, if you get a permissions error. The configure script will check to make sure that your computer is able to support the application (dependencies, hardware requirements, etc) and then, assuming that all criteria  are met, will create a makefile.\nUp next we have to compile the source code presented in the archive. You can do so by running\nmake\n\nwith a sudo or su if applicable. This will find the makefile created by the configure script, giving it the ok to compile the application. This step can be pretty lengthy, depending on the software.\nThe last step is to install our compiled application. This is done with the command\nmake install\n\nagain using superuser if needed. After this step is complete, you can run the application and delete its files (the archive and the extracted directory.) Congratulations!\nIf you just want the quick way that works for most applications (not all), extract your file using tar -xfv filename.tar.x, switch to its extracted directory, and paste this into your terminal:\nsudo ./configure\nsudo make\nsudo make install\n\nThis assumes you are using Ubuntu of course. If you aren't, you shouldn't need this guide. Good luck!\n", "Q: Extract Tar file I am not able to extract tar file \nCommand \ntar -xvfz node_archive.tar.gz khem\nError \nshow error tar:z: can't open :No such file or directory\ntar: Error is not recoverable : Exiting now \n\nA: Run the following commands on terminal,\ncd /path/to/the/directory/which/contains/node_archive.tar.gz\ntar -xzvf node_archive.tar.gz\n\n", "Q: No Unity, Desktop Icons (13.10) After 3 reinstalls on my Dell Dimension 2400, I can only see the desktop background and the cursor.

Thanks.\n\nA: find offers an \"or\" (-o) operator:\nfind $Path_Backup_Dir -type f -mtime $Time \\( -name \\*sql.gz -o -name \\*.sql \\)\n\nThe default operator between expressions is \"and\" (-a).  Since \"and\" has higher priority than \"or\", we need to use parens to group the two \"-name\" expressions together to get the right logic.  Because shells typically treat parens specially, I have escaped them with a backslash to protect them.\nAlternatively, you can use a regular expression:\nfind $Path_Backup_Dir -type f -mtime $Time -regex '.*\\.(sql|sql.gz)'\n\nYou should also note that your find/read command pipeline won't respond well to files with special names (leading space trailing spaces, newlines, etc.).  See, for example, this wiki for ways to hand that issue.\n\nA: Simply use the \"-or\" operator :\n#Find and Move backup files older than the time constraint defined\nfind $Path_Backup_Dir -type f -mtime $Time \\( -name *sql.gz -or -name *sql \\) | while read file\ndo\n    echo \"Earlier Backup $file will be moved to archive folder.\" >> $Path_Log_File\n    mv -f $file $Path_Mysql_Archive\ndone\n\nYou can do all with a single command:\nfind $Path_Backup_Dir -type f \\( -name *.sql -or -name *.sql.gz \\) -exec mv -f -v {} /tmp/test2 \\; >> $Path_Log_File\n\n", "Q: could not load module rsyslog lmnsd_gtls.so The rsyslog module is showing up in system log /var/log/syslog as message repeated.  rsyslog was also showing 99% cpu use in top at one point, possibly unrelated.\ntail /var/log/syslog\nDec  1 22:18:16 here rsyslogd-2066: could not load module '/usr/lib/rsyslog/lmnsd_gtls.so', dlopen: /usr/lib/rsyslog/lmnsd_gtls.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n [try http://www.rsyslog.com/e/2066 ]\nDec  1 22:18:56 here rsyslogd-2066: last message repeated 4 times\n\nlsb_release -a\nDescription:    Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS\nRelease:        12.04\nsudo apt-cache showpkg rsyslog\nPackage: rsyslog\nVersions: \n5.8.6-1ubuntu8.5\nRelated Question : How do I find that lmnsd_gtls.so is related to rsyslog-gnutls ?\n\nA: Get the missing module by installing the rsyslog-gnutls package.\nsudo apt-get install rsyslog-gnutls\nsee also http://virtuallyhyper.com/2013/06/install-splunk-and-send-logs-to-splunk-with-rsyslog-over-tcp-with-ssl/\nsee also http://help.papertrailapp.com/kb/configuration/encrypting-remote-syslog-with-tls-ssl\nCheck to see if the module file exists :\nls -la /usr/lib/rsyslog/lmnsd_gtls.so\n\nA: This happened with me when I was trying to set up syslog with tls certificate similar to this.

I was successfully using UBUNTU for a while until after a silly mistake I deleted some files. I had the system running together with my Windows but now I cannot reboot in Ubuntu, it gives me an error message and says that some files are missing :(\nIs there a way I can uninstall Ubuntu from within Windows?  \nOr can I just install the same version of UBUNTU? would the two systems not collide?\n\nA: No you can't (but actually you can), supposing you have done a conventional job of reformatting a partition on your HDD as ext4 and installing Ubuntu on that. Windows will not recognize that format (unless you have some third-party software installed, like these or these ones) and therefore you won't see it anywhere in Windows to be able to delete it or anything.\nAs for reinstalling, I think you would only have the option to remove previous version installed before being able to install again on the same partition, leaving no chance of collision by definition.\nPS: to give so probably more sensible links, taken from the already given one, (some of) the third-party softwares are Ext2Fsd, Linux Reader and Ext2Read.\n\nA: Hello Masha and welcome to Ubuntu!\nYou can, in fact, install Ubuntu again and replace the broken version on your computer. If you wish to do so, then proceed to install Ubuntu again, but when you are asked to choose where to install Ubuntu, select Something Else. The next screen may look rather intimidating, but don't worry, I am here to help. At this screen, select the row that lists ext4 under the Type column in the chart, and then click the minus sign near the bottom of the window. After, you will note the words \"free space\" being in place of ext4. Click this row again and then the plus sign near the bottom of the page. A window will appear and in it you must choose \"/\" as the \"mount point\" using the selection box in the window, and ensure that \"Beginning of this space\" and \"Logical\" are selected, too, as well as \"Ext4 Journaling File System\" for the \"Use as\" box. Click OK and then \"Install Now\" at the bottom of the previous window. \nNow, the installation will proceed as it did when you first installed Ubuntu. Let me know if you require assistance.\n\nA: I'd suggest you do what Sushantp606 said, just tell people what your mistake was and see if it can be undone.\nIf you really want to uninstall ubuntu though, the LiveCD could be used to uninstall it as well. On the disk partitioning window you could format the disk partition where ubuntu is installed, as if you are formatting your hard drive for a fresh installation. Be careful though, you don't want to destroy anything important(like your Windows installation). And avoid this method for as long as you can.\n", "Q: Sharing dualboot volumes space-efficiently I plan to dualboot my system [Ubuntu|Windows] using a small SSD. What are the options to save space? What I want is to have a either a \\home as small as possible or a \\home that I can use for both Ubuntu and Windows.\nShould a use a virtual volume file inside NTFS partition as home folder? This would be great for flexibility. Is it possible to make it growing so I don't have to size it in advance? Or should I better use a small /home partition and store all big files on windows NTFS partition?\n\nA: It depends.\nIn Linux it's /home by the way.\nNTFS is bit different than the normal Linux filesystems. As a result file system permissions do not work fully by default if you use NTFS in Linux. According to this answer they can be configured but if this is your first time setting up a dual-boot, my advice is don't do it.\nIf you have some big files that you access from both Operating Systems, e.g. video, then you could achieve some space savings by putting these to a separate NTFS partition, or accessing the Windows NTFS partition from Ubuntu directly.\n", "Q: Fresh Ubuntu Install (12.04), No Internet I just performed a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.04.3 64-bit, and I cannot connect to the internet.\nUbuntu is installed on its own partition, with Windows 7 on the other.

So using live Ubuntu 12.10 CD, I reinstalled my GRUB. But then when the same command was run (grub-install -v), It showed its GRUB 0.97\nThat means the live CD of Ubuntu 12.10 had GRUB 0.97.

Though its clear that my GRUB is 0.97 (as confirmed by the command run in terminal), so that's what I was thinking why the GRUB menu ( while booting ) shows the wrong version. \nWhat I think is that as my original O.S. (13.04) had GRUB 2.0, so due to reinstalling GRUB from Ubuntu12.10 (which has GRUB version 0.97), the boot-loader changed from GRUB 2.0 to GRUB version 0.97 but the heading remained unchanged.\nPlease focus some light on this.\nI would like to add that I followed Ubuntu site and upgraded my GRUB from 0.97 to GRUB 2.0.

If xdotool only reports one window id for your pid then the tail pipe is of course unnecessary. \n\nA: You can use wmctrl (man page) to manipulate windows from the command line.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the programm using sudo apt-get install wmctrl or any other package manager you feel comfortable with.\n\n*Get the window ID belonging to your PID. wmctrl -lp will list all existing windows with their window ID in the first and the PID in the second column of the output.\n\n*Raise the window with wmctrl -iR <window ID> or wmctrl -ia <window ID>, depending on whether you want to switch to its desktop or move it to the current one.\n\n\nA: This should do it:\nawk '$3 == 17213 {print $1}' <(wmctrl -lp) | xargs -i% sh -c \"xwit -id % -pop -raise; wmctrl -i -r % -b add,maximized_vert,maximized_horz\"\n\nYou'll need to change the ID in the awk statement but that will maximise and to activate the window. You'll also need to install xwit (sudo apt-get install xwit) for the un-minimisation to work.\n\nThe reason this is so complicated is because no one tool does everything you need and those that are slightly capable, have terminal issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*xdotool can't look up by PID (despite that being an advertised feature)\n\n*wmctrl doesn't know how to minimise and maximise things\n\n*xwit can't change window hints but it can un-minimise things\n\n\nIdeally this is something you should be able to do with just xdotool or wmctrl but their PID look-ups don't work or exist respectively.\n", "Q: How do I play an audio file using C++ in Linux?

I work on some personal python libraries and I need to display what PYTHONPATH contains and then manipulate it.\n\nA: Typically, the environment variable $PYTHONPATH is empty (try echo $PYTHONPATH). The actual list of folders python searches for libraries can be found with (in python):\nimport sys\nprint(sys.path)\n\nThis will consist (in search order) of the current directory, any directories in your $PYTHONPATH, and finally the default library directories, set by site.py. The main default locations are (where X.Y is the python version, eg 2.7):\n/usr/lib/pythonX.Y (python system libraries, eg re, urllib)\n/usr/lib/pythonX.Y/dist-packages (python libraries installed with deb packages)\n\nIf you use pip install --user or similar to install libraries as yourself, it will also contain the user library directory:\n/home/USERNAME/.local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages\n\nYou can manipulate the PYTHONPATH by either setting the environment variable before you launch python (PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/foo/bar), or by editing sys.path once you've started python (import sys; sys.path = [\"/foo/bar\"] + sys.path).\nHowever, if you want to play with your own python libraries, a good idea is to create a virtualenv. This is a directory in which you can play around with your own versions of python libraries without any risk of messing up the python libraries used by the system.

Here is a sample test script I tried:\ni=0\np=0\n\nwhile [ $i -lt 10 ]\ndo\n      i=$[$i + 1]\n      echo $i\n      p=$[$p + 1]\ndone | (zenity --progress --title=\"test\" --text=\"test\")\necho \"i: $i p: $p\"\n\nI noticed that the progress bar worked, however the variable p which is meant to be a counter was affected by zenity. Is there something wrong with my code? variable i is meant to echo the value in order to move the progress bar, while variable p is meant for other purposes. The values of p and i are both 0 despite incrementing it within the while loop. \nI am hoping that there is a way to make the variable p and i increment without removing the zenity progress bar. I am not sure why however, the incrementing of the variables work after the line (zenity --progress --title=\"test\" --text=\"test\") is removed\nAddition\nHow to use the variables i and p after the progress bar ended? And one more question, is it required to enclose the while loop with ()?\nThanks for any help!\n\nA: Increment and everything seems to be absolutely fine. But all the increments are taking place inside a subshell that is being passed to zenity. This is the reason why you are not getting the changes when you echo them outside the subshell. I am using your script, only adding something to print the variables inside do while loop on zenity popup window. To know more about the syntax of zenity progress dialog see the gnome help page. Run the script below and see the result,\n#!/bin/bash\ni=0\np=0\n(while [ $i -lt 100 ]\ndo\n    i=$[$i + 10]\n    echo $i ; sleep 1\n    echo \"#  now i is $i and p=$p\"\n    p=$[$p + 1]\ndone) | zenity --progress --title=\"test\" --text=\"test\"\necho \"i: $i p: $p\"\n\nI changed increment of i to 10 as i will be used to make the increment of progress bar and used sleep 1 to make the progress perceptible.\nObservation:\nThough the value are showing to be incremented on zenity pop-up. It is showing to be unchanged on terminal, i: 0 p: 0\n\nHope this would be helpful.\nHow to Use subshell variables outside\n\nThe parent shell can not use variables from its subshell. You could find more about subshell here . But you can always write variables from subshell to a temporary file for its parent to read. It may not be the best of the ways but it works.\n\n#!/bin/bash\n..\n(while [ $i -lt 100 ]\ndo\n    ...\n    ...\ndone\necho \"p=$(echo $p)\" > tmp\necho \"i=$(echo $i)\" >> tmp\n) | zenity --progress --title=\"test\" --text=\"test\"\n. tmp\nrm tmp\necho \"i: $i p: $p\"\n\nNow it will show up in the terminal like, i: 100 p: 10 so you an use them at your wish. And as you asked in last part, it is not the while loop rather it is subshell. It is custom to put contents of subshell inside parentheses.\n\nA: Process substitution can prevent annoying subshells from being created, but the syntax is a bit weird:\n$ k=0; for x in a b; do ((k++)); done | zenity --progress; echo \"$k\"\n\n→ 0 (Not OK)\n$ k=0; for x in a b; do ((k++)); done > >(zenity --progress); echo \"$k\"\n\n→ 2 (OK)\nWhat I like about that is that you generally don't have to heavily modify your script for it to work properly. However, some exotic shells might be missing this feature. For Bash, check the “Process Substitution” section of the manual.\nWith a code more close to the example from the initial question:\n  i=0\n  p=0\n\n  while [ $i -lt 10 ]\n  do\n        i=$[$i + 1]\n        echo $((10 * i))\n        sleep 0.1\n        p=$[$p + 1]\n  done > >(zenity --progress --title=\"test\" --text=\"test\")\n  echo \"i: $i p: $p\"\n\n(I added a sleep to make the progress more noticeable, and I echo ten times i to have a 100 when reaching the end of the loop.)\n", "Q: i cant install ubuntu using pendrive usb installer i have tried countless times to install ubuntu to my laptop/ netbook, but to no avail, i have followed all the instructions on this page:http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\n(i need to use a usb because my disk drive is broken) every time i try, i get a message saying that windows is unable to open the file, and it had me download DynSite, and when i tried to find the file it said it didnt exist. so if someone could please help me that would be great, thanks!\n\nA: If the menssage you get appears when you install ubuntu on your laptop you have to select on boot the usb. \nWhen you turn on your laptop, a key (F2, F4...) to boot options appears on monitor...or something like this. reboot you machine and press this key at the time it is appear, on boot options select USB.\n", "Q: Returning after VPN tunnel is up I have a working TeamCity setup for my projects on my local network using local resources like svn, web servers and database servers.

I want to add user called user on my ftp server, and that user will have access on just /home/user folder...And I want to he hasn't got access in back folders, home, root and that, just /home/user but I don't know every command. How can this be done?\n\nA: Most of these commands need to be run as root by the way, so for instance instead of chmod ..., it would be sudo chmod...\nThis all depends whether this  of restricting access to folder or allowing access to folders. This is on the chmod page, which is what makes it really useful:\n\nOwner is the permissions on that file of the owner of the folder - usually the user that has created them - can be changed with chown.\nGroup is the permissions on that file of the group of the folder - can be changed with the chown or the chgrp commands.\nOther is the permissions on that file of everyone who does not fall into the above two categories.\nSo running chmod 600 /PATH/TO/FILE will change the permissions so that  only the owner can read the file, and write to it. This is useful if ristekga is the only other user, as then they cannot access it, but the owner can.\nYou can also do the same for folders, but by using chmod -R 600 /PATH/TO/FILE so the contents of the folder is the same as well. You should be able to run this on all the folders not owned by ristekga to stop them accessing them.\nIf they are owned by ristekga, running chown -R USERNAME:GROUP /PATH/TO/FOLDER (or chown USERNAME:GROUP /PATH/TO/FILE) should work - where USERNAME is the name of the new owner, and GROUP is the name of the group the folder it is to part of - but this can usually be the same as the USERNAME.\n", "Q: Attempting to install Ubuntu on Oracle Virtual Box inside Win 7 After I get the ubuntu install completion message how do I shut down the virtual machine and reload so the VM will point to the new install rather than the install .iso image file?.

When I start ubuntu with i3-wm the font of all Applications is too big.\nHow do I change the Font and Size?\nI already looked into i3 Documentation but found nothing about this topic.\n\nA: Gtk programs will use gtk settings. If all fonts everywhere are too small you can work around it by changing display settings, e.g., what I do with my htpc and telly is to set dpi value. Setting them via gnome control center or whatever should work if you start gnome-settings-daemon in ~/.i3/config, otherwise, settings are in like ~/.gtkrc-2.0 and ~/.config/gtk-3.0.\n\nA: You need to change the configuration of i3, copying /etc/i3/config file to ~/.config/i3/config and then editing/adding your font configuration:\ncp /etc/i3/config ~/.config/i3/config\n\nNow you need to edit the file and add your preferences using the following syntax:\nfont <X core font description>\nfont pango:[family list] [style options] [size]\n\nThe first line describes the font description using the X core format, the second line describes it as space separated variables in the following order: font family  (Arial, Mono, Sans, etc.); style options such Bold, Italic, Underscore, etc.; and the last the size.

My issue is that when environment temperature elevates at 30-35 C my laptop is burning. CPU and GPU go up to 60-70 C and 70-80 C. With Win7 CPU and GPU are 10-15 C lower.

In the long run this can lead for instance to cracked solderjoints on the processor/GPU because of the difference in thermal expansion of board and chip, but it can take a few years before you get into trouble with that.\nYes, your chips are okay with high temperature...your mainboard, however, is not really happy with it.\nNormally, the main reason that the laptop runs 15  degrees hotter on ubuntu than on windows is the open source radeon videodriver.\nWhen you install the (proprietary) fglrx driver from the ubuntu repository you will see a drop of 10 to 20 degrees in temperature on your laptop.\nIf you are already on fglrx, and the temperatures are still above what you desire:  \n\n\n*\n\n*avoid unneeded 3D eyecandy.\n\n*Install powertop to tweak your hardware for low energy consumption and to reveal the biggest CPU resource-hogs on your system.\n\n*You might prefer a lightweight desktopmanager like LXDE, that will free up to (or over) 50% of your system resources\n\n\nWhen I'm running HD video on my netbook with GPU acceleration I have a CPU load of 90% to 100% on Ubuntu but a load of 20%-25% on Lubuntu (same netbook, same kernel, same drivers, same movie). \n\nA: Your system support up to 100°C!!! Unless you put your laptop on your legs or something flammable I don't see any problem, technically speaking.\n\nA: No. Although high temps are seen, the silicon is designed for it. \nAlthough you have not provided the CPU type, I went looking for the hottest CPU packaged with the ATI HD 4330 in HP Probooks, and found that was the T9600. Its max operating temperature is 105 degrees Centigrade.  My six year old Lenovos run up to 80 degrees Centigrade with no problems.\nHowever, you're free to contact HP with the model number of your lappie and find their maximum internal temp specification. \n", "Q: Running juju, how do you edit files?

This mean that you can't run a script in lock screen only if you schedule it to run from before.\nConsequently, your shortcut key or any other shortcut will never work when your computer is in lock screen.\n", "Q: How to install changes to /etc/crontab If I want to add lines to my system's /etc/crontab, what do I have to do to get them to take effect?\n\nBackground:\nI'm trying to set up a machine with Ubuntu 13.04 so that it automatically locks/unlocks the monitor during the workday (it's hanging on the wall).\nI've done this by adding the following to my /etc/crontab:\n00 18  * * mon-fri myuser export DISPLAY:=0 && gnome-screensaver-command -a\n00 18  * * mon-fri myuser export DISPLAY:=0 && xset dpms force standby\n00 08  * * mon-fri myuser export DISPLAY:=0 && gnome-screensaver-command -d\n00 08  * * mon-fri myuser export DISPLAY:=0 && xset dpms force on\n\nThe individual commands work fine, but I'm trying to test the crontab entries by setting the minute/day to the upcoming minute. For example, at 1:26PM I set the first two columns to 27 13 and waited until the next minute rolled around. But the commands don't appear to be getting executed. I also tried running sudo crontab /etc/crontab, but it doesn't seem to help.\n\nA: First, you likely need to specify a path to all commands.  For example:\n00 08  * * mon-fri DISPLAY=:0 /usr/bin/xset dpms force on\n\nAlternatively, you can put a PATH line at the top of your crontab file.  See man 5 crontab.\nSecond, the system should send cron output to you by email.  Check it for error messages.\n\nA: Upon further debugging, I've determined that running sudo crontab /etc/crontab is actually reloading the crontab and my commands are being run. Looks like it's just a problem with the specific commands. I was able to determine this by adding echo \"test\" >> /home/myuser/test.txt && to the beginning of the command.\n", "Q: How to uninstall KVM I need to completely remove KVM from my Ubuntu desktop, but even after removing the kvm packages, when I run the following command:\nvirsh -c qemu:///system list\n\nit shows:\n Id Name           State\n-------------------------\n\nThis indicates that KVM is still running.\nHow do I completely uninstall KVM from my system?\n\nA: I had installed it via tha following command :\nsudo apt-get install qemu-kvm libvirt-bin ubuntu-vm-builder bridge-utils\n\nHence my uninstall command was :\nsudo apt-get remove --purge qemu-kvm libvirt-bin ubuntu-vm-builder bridge-utils\n\nWhich worked fine for me.\n\nA: After you removed kvm using the following command:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge kvm\n\ncheck if kvm is deleted properly by making sure these three things are deleted:\n/etc/kvm\n/etc/udev/rules.d/45-kvm.rules\n/etc/init.d/kvm\n\nIf these are still existing, remove them manually.\n", "Q: Server GUI, problem after installation I've recently acquired a small dedicated server from \"X\" company.\nI'm using it for small tasks such as torrenting, ftp, minecraft, etc.\nSo, I'm trying to install a GUI for my server to browse the web at work (We have a lot of restriction on websites :( )\nI read a couple of tutorials, but they all assume I have the server plugged-in right front of me. \nI have Ubuntu Server 13.10 installed, I created a new user, lets say, called Anon.\nThen, I installed the desktop via $ apt-get install ubuntu-desktop && cinnamon\nAfter that, I installed vnc4server to log remotely into the machine; but all I get is a terminal in the vnc viewer.

I would like to live boot Ubuntu from a USB drive, or failing that, a DVD.  (I do not want to install Ubuntu on this machine).\nWhenever I attempt to boot the install/live Ubuntu 13.10 from either a USB drive or a DVD, it loads the GRUB boot menu, but selecting any option results in the same results:  The screen goes blank, the USB or DVD drive blinks a couple of times then goes dark, and nothing else happens.  Booting will work if the Setup Utility is configured for \"CSM Boot\", but this mode fails to boot the Windows 8.1 install.\nI have read dozens of threads about this and similar issues, but none of those seem to apply exactly to my experience.  I have tried a number of suggestions from those threads, without success:\n\n\n*\n\n*Computer Setup utility is at latest available version\n\n*Secure Boot can be either on or off, with no effect\n\n*Fast Boot is disabled\n\n*Windows 8 Fast Startup is disabled\n\n*Computer setup has no \"Intel Speed Step\" setting\n\n*I have verified that the computer is booting the DVD/USB in UEFI mode, as per https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI#Identifying_if_the_computer_boots_the_Ubuntu_DVD_in_EFI_mode\n\n*Computer setup has only two Boot Modes, \"UEFI Boot\" and \"CSM Boot\", which apply to all drives.\n\n*Setting Boot Mode to \"CSM Boot\" allows successful boot of Ubuntu 13.10 from both USB and DVD.  However, the computer then fails to boot Windows 8.1, so this is not an acceptable solution.  It is not possible to configure UEFI/CSM per drive.\n\n*I have tried standard DVD from iso, USB from iso using Unetbootin, and USB from iso using dd.  All fail to boot in UEFI mode in the same way.\n\n\nUpdate:\nI have tried the following kernel options without effect:\nnomodeset,\nacpi=0,\nacpi_osi=linux,\nacpi_backlight=vendor,\nnoalpic,\ni915.i915_enable_rc6=1,\nvideo=1280x1024-24@60,\nvideo=VGA-1:1280x1024-24@60\n\nUpdate 2:\nI don't know if this will provide any useful information:  When I boot to USB, I reach the GRUB menu.  If I press 'c' for command line, then manually input the lines that are present in the grub.cfg file for \"Try Ubuntu without installing\" ...\nset gfxpayload=keep\nlinux /casper/vmlinuz.efi file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper quiet splash --\ninitrd /casper/initrd.lz\n\n... then all three of these command succeed.  But when I issue the boot command, the light on my USB drive immediately turns off, with no further output to the screen.\nPartial Resolution:\nAs per oldfred's suggestion, disabling the integrated NIC allowed the computer to boot from USB in UEFI mode.  Of course, the ethernet adapter is now completely disabled, so it is not exactly a proper solution, but it's a step in the right direction!\nThis does not seem to be strictly a driver issue.  Disabling the appropriate kernel driver module via GRUB command line (by appending modprobe.blacklist=alx, which I have previously verified as successfully disabling the ethernet driver) does not result in a successful boot if the LAN port is enabled in the computer setup.  Something else must be going on.\nAgain, I do not wish to install Ubuntu to this machine; only boot from USB/DVD.  And configuring the laptop in \"CMS Boot\" mode does work for both USB and DVD, but it is not an option as it renders Windows 8.1 unbootable.  Any other suggestions are appreciated.\n\nA: A user posted this in the forum who had a P50.\n\nTurned NIC (Integrated Network Interface Controller) off and then\n  booted off of USB. Was NOT an issue with any Linux distro just a quirk\n  of the laptop.  Am now running 13.10 daily and everything works. Also\n  had to stick with EFI boot ON, Secure Boot disabled.

It's OK for tempfiles to vanish from within it, but the target directory must exist or PostgreSQL will fail to start.\nYou can even give an explicit tablespace parameter to a CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE ... etc, allowing you to control where things go to distribute I/O around if you know more about the workload than the database server does.\n", "Q: Where Can I Find \"mkisofs\" and \"cdrecord\" for Ubuntu 12.04 (e.g., iso9660 ufs) Where can I find mkisofs and cdrecord for Ubuntu 12.04 (e.g., iso9660 ufs)?\n\nA: The good news is that if you are after the authentic cdrecord and mkisofs (rather than the Debian fork of these applications) Brandon Snider's PPA holds version of these great applications as far back as Ubuntu 12.04 and forward in time to the most recent Ubuntu release.\nAdd the PPA as follows:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:brandonsnider/cdrtools\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen install the following from  Terminal window:\nsudo apt-get install cdda2wav cdrecord mkisofs\n\nAnd now you should be good to go for any version of Ubuntu...\n\nA: Install apt-file, then you can search for the package which contains them:\n$ apt-file search mkisofs\naptoncd: /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/APTonCD/core/mkisofs.py\ndebian-cd: /usr/share/debian-cd/tools/set_mkisofs_opts\ngenisoimage: /usr/bin/mkisofs\nhorde3: /usr/share/horde3/lib/VFS/ISOWriter/mkisofs.php\nmanpages-ja: /usr/share/man/ja/man8/mkisofs.8.gz\npybackpack: /usr/share/pyshared/pybackpack/mkisofs.py\nrootstrap: /usr/lib/rootstrap/modules/mkisofs\n\nLooks like genisoimage has mkisofs, and similarly, wodim has cdrecord.\n", "Q: Why does minecraft run so slow?

Ubuntu have application for searching your drivers also.\nNow bigger issues I have seen in Ubuntu are Wi-Fi issues. Some drivers installed by default and some of them or not. Some manufactures were even not provide Linux support.\n\nA: Have you tried it yet?\nIf not, try Ubuntu as a live disc - seems to me, chances are, if it works on the live disc, it should work on your PC. This is a risk-free way to try Linux without changing anything on your PC. How do you do a live disc? Simply download Ubuntu, burn it to a DVD and then boot from that DVD. If you don't know how to boot from a DVD, that's a separate question entirely, but you can ask.\nDoes it work? Is it broken?\nIf you tried Ubuntu, and everything seems to be working - you can connect to WiFi/internet, play your music CDs, etc. - great! Enjoy the freedom and security of Linux. You should really only need to worry if there is something specific that isn't working. If this is the case, come back and describe what you expected your PC to do, what you tried to get it working, and what happened when you tried it.\nExtensions for Software?\nUbuntu (Linux), unlike Windows, doesn't need a special extension (ie: .EXE, .BAT, .MSI...) for executables - in other words, programs and software.

Output\n  copied to clipboard or saved as CSV\\HTML file.\n\n\nA: You can achieve this with some proper bash ninja-fu. :)\nYou know the procedure to calculate one at a time:\n$ echo abc | md5sum\n0bee89b07a248e27c83fc3d5951213c1  -\n$ echo abc | sha1sum\n03cfd743661f07975fa2f1220c5194cbaff48451  -\n\nEdit: as @gertvdijk suggested, and reading the info pages a bit more, this can be done directly with tee and Process Substitution supported by modern shells, without redirects. This way you can pass your data to two processes and one file using tee:\n$ echo abc | tee >(md5sum) >(sha1sum) > output.txt\n\nIt's also possible to chain if you need more, but you have to take care of STDOUT from all the subprocesses. This will NOT give you the expected result, but mixes the first two checksums together with the data in output.txt:\n$ echo abc | tee >(md5sum) >(sha1sum) | tee >(sha256sum) >(sha512sum) > output.txt\n\nIf you redirect the checksums to a file inside the substituted processes, you can chain these as you like:\n$ echo abc | tee >(md5sum > /tmp/md5.txt) >(sha1sum > /tmp/sha1.txt) | tee >(sha256sum > /tmp/sha256.txt) >(sha512sum > /tmp/sha512.txt) > output.txt\n\nHere's my initial suggestion without process substitution, but which allows chaining/recursive use without mixing the data and the output:\n$ echo abc | tee -a /proc/self/fd/2 2> >(sha1sum) > >(md5sum)\n0bee89b07a248e27c83fc3d5951213c1  -\n03cfd743661f07975fa2f1220c5194cbaff48451  -\n\nThe trick here is to use tee, which duplicates the data to STDOUT and a file. We're being clever by telling it to write the data to the file /proc/self/fd/2, which happens to always be the current process' STDERR file descriptor. And with the > >(program) syntax we can redirect each file descriptor to a program's STDIN instead of a file. Just like |, but with more control. > >(md5sum) redirects STDOUT to the md5sum program, while 2> >(sha1sum) redirects STDERR to the sha1sum program.\nNote that the order of 2> and > seems to matter, I have to put 2> first on the command line. These are evaluated from right to left, but I'm not sure why this makes a difference.\nTo do this on a file or a hard drive, you should replace \"echo abc\" with a cat or a dd, eg:\ndd if=/dev/sda bs=8k | tee -a /proc/self/fd/2 2> >(sha1sum) > >(md5sum)\n\nThe nifty thing about this is that you can actually recurse and run several at the same time, not just two. The syntax gets hairy, but this works:\necho abc | tee -a /proc/self/fd/2 2> >(tee -a /proc/self/fd/2 2> >(sha256sum) > >(sha384sum) ) > >(sha512sum)\n\nIf you want to capture the result and use it in a script, that works too:\nA=$(echo abc | tee -a /proc/self/fd/2 2> >(sha1sum) > >(md5sum))\n\nNow $A is a string containing all the output, including newlines. You can parse the values out later too:\necho \"checksum=[$(echo \"$A\" | head -1 | cut -d \" \" -f 1)]\"\n\nI'm not sure you have any guarantees regarding ordering of the output though.\n\nA: Here i have find one python script from source which calculate hash values. and also i find some statistics about hash value calculation.\n\n - `md5sum` takes 00:3:00 min to calculate 4GB USB.\n - `sha2sum` takes 00:3:01 min to calculate 4GB USB.\n - While phython script takes 3:16 min to calculate both MD5 and SHA1.\n\n//Script start from here    \ndef get_custom_checksum(input_file_name):\n    from datetime import datetime\n    starttime = datetime.now()\n    # START: Actual checksum calculation\n    from hashlib import md5, sha1, sha224, sha384, sha256, sha512\n    #chunk_size = 1 # 1 byte -- NOT RECOMENDED -- USE AT LEAST 1KB.

This meta-package doesn't contain anything by itself, but sets a set of requirements that will be automatically downloaded. \nIf you remove the ubuntu-desktop package and then want to upgrade to a newer version of Ubuntu, this package will not be upgraded so if a new package is added in the new version, it won't be automatically installed because nothing requires it. \nIn your case, it's perfectly safe to remove it and if you want to reinstall it, just install the ubuntu-desktop package, which will then also reinstall the printing package. \n", "Q: SAKIS 3G - Use of Google DNS I am using UBuntu 12.04 LTS and I am using SAKIS 3G script to connect to my 3g wireless modem, i want to use google DNS by default , i don't know, how to use google DNS in sakis3g script. \nIn native Network manager,there is a box to change these values.\nTell me, how to configure this in sakis 3g script.\nIf this can be done via /etc/sakis3g.conf then what need to be entered in this file.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Maybe this tutorial can work for you: Click here\n\nA: You'll just need to modify /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf\n\n\n*\n\n*Find the line that reads #prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;\n\n*Replace with prepend domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8;\n(Notice that we're also uncommenting this line so that it takes effect.)\n", "Q: How to set the ID3 Year on an mp3?

I would like to have this option in right click menu on the desktop or in nautilus. I know that is possible, but I don't remember how to do this.\n\nA: You may want to use Templates directory (or how is called in your language) from your home directory in this sense. Files from this folder will appear in the New Document menu. So, add the files with the extension what you want in this folder and you can create them after files with the same extension from the right click menu:\n\nMoreover, if you add some predefined text in these files from Templates folder, the new files which you will create them from the right click menu will contain that text.\nSee also: What is the \"Templates\" folder in the home directory for?\n", "Q: installing 64 bit kernel on 32bit ubuntu I compiled my own custom kernel in a 64 bit linux mint 16 installation. I've also heard that the 64 bit kernel could also run 32 bit applications too. Would it be possible to install it and use it in the 32-bit Ubuntu 13.10 installation or do I have to recompile it again for the 32-bit? If 32 bit Ubuntu would run on this kernel, Is there any problems I am going to encounter while using this kernel?\n\nA: The following combinations will work:\n32 bit CPU with 32 bit kernel and 32 bit software\n64 bit CPU with 32 bit kernel and 32 bit software\n64 bit CPU with 64 bit kernel and 32 bit software\n64 bit CPU with 64 bit kernel and 64 bit software\n\nIn general running 32 bit software with a 64 bit kernel means having most of your system 64 bit and just running a few 32 bit applications - usually things like skype or steam for which we do not have source code and hence cannot recompile for a new processor.\nIn theory it should be possible to run an entirely 32-bit userland with only a 64 bit kernel. See, eg reports of people doing this successfully on Arch. But the package manager is unlikely to be happy with this, so it would involve quite a lot of DIY.\nIn the past this was an attractive option because running 32 bit applications in a 64 bit userland was fraught with problems. This is now largely solved, so running a mixed system in this way seems to have few advantages, and many disadvantages, compared to just running a pure 64 bit system.\n\nA: I don't believe that you can.\nKernels exist for 32-bit and 64-bit systems, make sure that you have the kernel matching your system. If you have 64-bit, then install and use the 64bit kernel. If you have a 32-bit system, then use 32bit kernel.\n", "Q: Is this correct Ubuntu for me? I have Intel I7 4770 processor with 4GB RAM.

In Windows, I am used to modify directory dates, eg. of directories containing photos according the date when the first photo was taken; and then display a list of the directories sorted by the dates. In Ubuntu, Krusader can display the directories this way.\nI need to change the date (the \"date of modifying\") of a directory after I fill it with eg. the photos. How should I change it?

It will just get changed as soon as anything in the directory changes anyhow ( like when a thumbnail is generated ).  Instead, rename the directory so the date you want is in the name.\n", "Q: Should I defragment my hard disk before installing using WUBI? Is it advisable to defragment my hard disk before using WUBI? Is there any other precautions that I should  take before using WUBI ? My os is windows XP-32 bit.\n\nA: You should indeed defragment your hard disk before installing ubuntu. You should also make two backups of all your files and make sure you know what you are doing. In other words, read everything on WUBI install you can find on this website.\n\nA: *\n\n*Don't use WUBI; do a real install\n\n*Get rid of XP while you are at it; it is about to reach end of life and will no longer get security patches.\n\n", "Q: ls command very slow after deletion of thousand files on a directory I have a dir under /home/myuser dir which an application stores and deletes millions of temporary files. When I do ls on this dir (now it only has a hundred files only) it is too slow (actually I do not get any output for many minutes). After some google search and doing:\nls -dl ~/mydir/\n\nI get this\ndrwxrwxrwx 2 myuser myuser 160108544 Oct 12 11:31 /home/myuser/mydir/\n\nwhich basically means I have to re-index directory entries for this directory (if I understood correctly). How do I do force such a re-indexing on this dir?\n\nA: Create a new directory, move the remaining files to the new directory, remove the old one, and rename the new one to the old name.\n\nA: It depends of the underlaying file system type you use, most of the file system do not compact directories after a deletion.\nUnmount the filesystem and use e2fsck -D to optimize the directories.\nIf that problem occurs many time you should consider to use a dedicated file system for that directory. You should use a different file system type, I don't know which one will dynamically compact the directory entries, Btrfs by design is advertised to not suffer of that problem.\nEdit:\ne2fsck -D can take a very long time, psusi answer is a good alternative to avoid reindexing the whole filesystem.\n", "Q: How to expand the privileged port range past 1024? Port numbers under 1024 are reserved for superuser, so a normal user cannot bind to ports in the range.\nAnd a range of ports that the system will assign random bind requests from can be set in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range So I can reserve a range from automatic allocation. But how do I deny access to non-privileged users to a range of ports?\nFor example I would like to have ports 16000-17000 to be ONLY usable by superuser. Or just increasing the standard 0-1024 to 0-17000 or some arbitrary number I choose. How can I accomplish this?\n\nA: In your kernel source find include/net/sock.h\nInside sock.h find: \n#define PROT_SOCK   1024\n\nAnything lower than the number on that line will be a protected port.\nIf you want a lower bound as well you can probably find where to add that in by looking for where PROT_SOCK gets used and adding an additional check.  A quick pass with grep shows that the check is done per protocol, so you'll need to modify the test for ipv4, ipv6, and whatever else you use individually.  \nIt should be relatively easy, but you'll have to maintain it by hand whenever you want to upgrade the kernel.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu Install Your PC Drivers Automatically? Does Ubuntu install your PC drivers automatically?\nAnd does it need to be updated like Windows Update?\n\nA: There is quite possibility that some of your drivers might be missing while Ubuntu installs most of them.\nYou can go to 'System Settings' and under 'Hardware' section click on 'Additional Drivers'. It will automatically search for drivers and it will ask if you want to install those  drivers.\nYou can search for System Settings by hitting the start button (also called super key) and typing in \"System Settings\"\nSystem Settings -> 'Hardware' section -> Additional Drivers\nAnd yes you need to update your drivers over a period of time which may vary from driver to driver.\nUpdate: On Ubuntu 18.04 you find Additional Drivers under Software & Updates.\n\nA: The linux kernal loads most of your drivers automatically when it starts up but sometimes you might find that you have hardware that doesn't have a driver in that version of the kernal. This is becoming less of a problem over time as more and more drivers are encorporated into the Linux Kernal. \nSometimes hardware such as some broadcom wireless adapters have proprietary drivers meaning that the manufacturer has released linux drivers for these products but they are not open source. This means that you need to enable them in Ubuntu and often have to agree to some smallprint. More information about proprietary drivers can be found here:\nhttp://www.ubuntulinuxguide.com/proprietarydrivers.htm\nAs for updates, Ubuntu has a Software Update Centre which is similar to Windows Update in that it updates software on your PC. It's important to stay up-to-date with the latest security updates at least as this will help keep you safe whilst using your PC.\nThe Software Update Centre often notifies you when it has updates available or you can open the program to see whether any updates are available.\n\nA: Linux unlike Windows has a different approach on handling hardware, drivers, and software. Hardware drivers are incorporated into the Linux Kernel, software will have to be installed in addition to that.\nSoftware\n\n*\n\n*\"Essential\" packages (i.e. software) will always be installed to have a running system.\n\n*Several software packages are installed with your distribution. These will automatically be installed on your computer.\n\n*Additional custom software installed by the user later.\n\nSoftware Updates\nAll software including our individual software packages will automatically update for bug fixes and security issues if we had installed them from the official software repositories. Only very rarely we will encounter software not available there. Only then we have to manually take care of updates.\nDrivers\nSame holds true for hardware drivers. It is our goal to not have to install any hardware drivers to the kernel but to have a fully functional system in the first place.\nThis goal is achieved for the majority of hardware but sadly not for all because some manufacturers make a big secret out of their drivers  (\"proprietary\"). And occasionally the free and Open Source drivers will not support all hardware features.\nMany manufacturers provide their drivers in a Linux compatible version. These drivers are Closed Source, and therefore we do not install them by default (we believe Open Source is much better). Such drivers can still be installed, maintained, and updated from within Ubuntu:\n\n*\n\n*How do I install additional drivers?\nManually installed drivers\nOnly very rarely we may have hardware which is not yet or not fully supported by Ubuntu. Then we may have to manually install drivers from somewhere else. This always bears a great risk of introducing instabilities as these drivers are not tested to work with Ubuntu. It is therefore not recommended to do so when you start to learn the Ubuntu way of getting your work done.\nAutomatic updates\nSoftware updates, kernel updates, and driver updates can be downloaded and installed in the background. It is us the users who decide in our settings how much we want to get involved by this or how often we automatically want to check for updates. But in any case there is no need to restart our system or interrupt our work for any update. Few updates however will only be activated after the next reboot (e.g. kernels).\n\nA: I am using the below command and it's doing fine for me for Ubuntu >= 18.04\n\nsudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall\n\n", "Q: I have trouble finding the url and drivers for my HP network printer I want to find the HP printer that shares my wifi router, also another linux machine on the same network\n\nA: Hp drivers can be installed with :\nsudo apt-get install hp-ppd hpijs hpijs-ppds hplip hplip-cups hplip-data hplip-dbg hplip-doc hplip-gui printer-driver-postscript-hp\n\nIn the application Printers, you can assign a IP for the Printer.\nin the HPLIP Toolbox application, you need to proceed with Network/Ethernet/wireless option :\n\n", "Q: \"Sub-process gzip returned an error code (1)\", how to fix? when i try,\nali@ali-office:~$ sudo apt-get upgrade\nReading package lists...

It is heartening to know that you are looking forward to give Ubuntu a try.\nIs it worth installing Ubuntu to its own partition instead of using WUBI?\n\nIn my opinion, absolutely yes!\n\nWUBI is a tool provided by Ubuntu community to enable a new user to take a glance at Ubuntu user Interface, its basic fuctionality etc. However, at the end of the day, it is only a tool running inside another operating system, using some of the host's features. To experience the power and ease of use in an Ubuntu system, it is recommended to go for a fully functional and independent Ubuntu installation, even if it has to be placed alongside any other operating system. I am sure you would love the experience of seeing Ubuntu in action on its own!\nI understand that there could be some apprehension around the decision of disturbing an existing OS and partitions. Ubuntu installation process has been designed to give you a smooth experience during and even after installation. If you are a new Ubuntu user, it is recommened though, to go through the entire installation procedure of your chosen Ubuntu flavor carefully before starting. Even after that, if anything goes wrong, let me assure you, we at Ask Ubuntu are always ready to assist you with any problem you might face.\n\nHow to partition the disk to install Linux-Secure-Remix\nBased on my experience with Ubuntu (and the fact that I am also relatively new to it), I will recommend the partitioning your hard drive as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*RECOVERY : Do not touch\n\n*OS : Do not touch\n\n*DATA : \nResize with GParted to create free space at the end of the existing partition; at least 10 GB. You may do this operation from within Windows using any other partitioning software or by booting with Ubuntu LiveDVD or LiveUSB.\nThis free space can be used to create an ext3 or ext4 partition usable by a Linux system. This will serve as your Ubuntu partition.\nNote : It will be a good idea to go through recommended partitioning scheme for Ubuntu before starting installation.\nWish you a great Ubuntu experience!\n", "Q: opening var/www with windows from ubuntu server I have apache2 installed on a ubuntu12.04 workstation and in the var/www folder is an index.html.
