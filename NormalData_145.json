["Q: When I create files using < touch > command, files are now all locked. What changed? I am a new user of Linux and am using Ubuntu 13.04 Raring Ringtail.\nI really like the malleability of this operating system despite the fact that the common opinion, according to general information online by experienced users is that it offers limited control as compared to other Linux distributions and versions of Ubuntu.\nAnyway, my quesiton relates to why creating files for the Home directory has suddenly resulted in producing only locked files which I cannot unlock despite the fact that:\n\n\n*\n\n*I created them as a root user,\n\n*I am the only user,\n\n*Originally, I created several files using the ' touch ' command and they were accessible in the home directory. Now, I cannot even set the permissions for these locked files.\n\n\nWould be really interested to know what might have caused this as I don't recall changing any settings, (at least not on purpose).\nLooking forward to your replies.\n\nA: Handuel's answer is right. If you created the files using sudo, they belong to the root user and you don't have privileges as yourself to edit them. You can check this is the case by listing the directory's contents with ls -l.\nIf you want to be able to modify them as yourself (your user) you should change their ownership with sudo chown youruser:yourgroup <file> (eg sudo chown matt:matt test.txt). Changing their permissions would also work (sudo chmod 777 test.txt makes it universally editable, which isn't advised, but is useful to know) but changing ownership is preferable. If you prefer the GUI, you can change ownership/permissions graphically with sudo -H nautilus and then right-clicking the relevant files to access their properties.\nA lot of problems are commonly encountered when using sudo where it doesn't need to be used, like not being able to log in, or programs not starting right, so use sparingly. \n\nA: They are locked because you create them as root user. This means they are roots files, so only accessible by root.\n\nA: Or, it could mean that the umask is set wrong.\ndo this: sudo umask 022\nProcedure To Setup Default umask\nYou can setup umask in /etc/bashrc or /etc/profile file for all users. By default most Linux distro set it to 0022 (022) or 0002 (002). Open /etc/profile or ~/.bashrc file, enter:\n# vi /etc/profile\n\nOR\n$ vi ~/.bashrc\n\nAppend/modify following line to setup a new umask:\numask 022\n\nSave and close the file. Changes will take effect after next login. All UNIX users can override the system umask defaults in their /etc/profile file, ~/.profile (Korn / Bourne shell) ~/.cshrc file (C shells), ~/.bash_profile (Bash shell) or ~/.login file (defines the user's environment at login).\n", "Q: Shortcuts no longer work for move window to left/right of screen in 12.04 I used to be able to send windows to the left/right half of the screen with ctrl-windows-left and ctrl-windows-right in 12.04.

Maybe you're still using an old Unity Tweek Tool that is NOT compatible with Ubuntu 13.04.\nCheck your Unity Tweak Tool version. Open a terminal and paste this command:\ndpkg -l | grep unity-tweak-tool\n\nThe latest version available at the moment of writing this is 0.0.5-0~136~raring1. If you have an older version, go to the official PPA, add it again to your system and then update.\nThunderbird\nYou are not providing too much information. This can be caused by several problems. These are some of the most common:\nDisk space\nCheck that there is disk space available. You can do that on several ways, but a very simple and quick one is by using the terminal. Launch a terminal from Unity, and run this command\ndf -h\n\nYou'll see one line for every mount point. If you see some mount point with a large usage (>95%) try to free some space.\nPackage manager Status\nThe package manager status could be bad, so some packages can be mid-installed, or mid-upgraded. You can check that by issuing this command:\nsudo apt-get -f install\n\nIf that says 0 packages for updating and such, everything is fine. Don't worry about not updated packages. You can have some not updated packages and still everything is fine.\nUser profile\nMaybe your Thunderbird user profile is corrupted somehow. The easiest way to test this is to create another user, login as that user, and try to run Thunderbird. \nIf Thunderbird is working with that user, then just simply move your old Thunderbird profile to some other location.\nmv ~/.thunderbird ~/.thunderbird-old\n\nAnd then try to start Thunderbird again. You will lose your configurations, though. But worry not, you can still configure it again to access your local mail, if available.\n", "Q: How to get Google Drive (Docs) search to work in Unity Dash?

This is the biggest thing keeping me from enjoying Ubuntu/Linux.\nIdeally I'd like to just be able to run my AutoHotKey script on Ubuntu, but I didn't have much luck getting that working with Wine.\nHere's what I'm doing in AHK (using extra modifiers also works, Shift+Alt+l is Shift+right).\n!l:: Send, {Right}\n+!l:: Send, +{Right}\n^!l:: Send, ^{Right}\n^+!l:: Send, ^+{Right}\n\nI tried AutoKey, but it wasn't consuming input, remapping Alt + I to right arrow key worked, but it still executed Alt + I, which sometimes selects an item from the application menu.\nThe closest I got was xbindkeys for setting up hotkeys, this seems to work great. And xvkbd for simulating input; this part is really buggy; it doesn't work in all programs, and causes me to lose focus a lot, among other issues.\nFor anyone wondering what I'm trying to do: I use I J K L as arrow keys while Alt is down.\n\nA: I've never used xvkbd, but there are two other great programs for simulating keyboard input that I like and use. One is xte and the other is xdotool.  \nsudo apt-get install xautomation xdotool  \n\nBoth xdotool and xte are very similar, but since I use xte the most I'll go into that one.  \nxte:\nThe most basic syntax for xte is:  \nxte 'command key/mousebutton/xyCoordinates'\n\nxte can do a lot more than just create keyboard input though, it can also move your mouse and simulate mouse button presses, among others things.\nSyntax examples:\n\n\n*\n\n*To call a single key press: xte 'key keyName'\n\n*To call a key combination: xte 'keydown keyName' 'keydown secondKeyName' 'keyup keyName' 'keyup secondKeyName\n\n*To call a mouse button: xte 'mouseclick buttonNumber' (You can find button numbers through xev)\n\n*To move the mouse: xte 'mousemove xCoordinate yCoordinate'\n\n*And more!

A list of players is displayed when left clicking the volume indicator applet of Xfce panel.\n\nBut others are installed that I want to see there. Can I add them?\n\nA: Yes there is. You need to run Dconf Editor.\n(This is not limited to Xfce.)\n\n\nBut:\nAs specified by Takkat in a comment, this will fully work only for players controlled by MPRIS and DBus. This type of players will automatically be listed if installed. (This means that dfconf will not be useful to add such programs, as they are automatically added, but only to set the preferred ones, with the play/pause and next/previous buttons, and to remove unwanted players by adding them as 'blacklisted'.)\nA sort of workaround for \"unsupported\" players like DeaDBeef or SMPlayer is to set them as 'preferred', which will display the play/pause and next/previous buttons. The buttons will not work as intended for these programs, but the players can be started with the 'play' button. \nIn the image below, for ex., the unsupported DeaDBeeF (as well as the supported Audacious) can be started, but SMPlayer cannot. After adding smplayer in the list of 'preferred', a big 'play' button appears (after logout) which can be used to start the player - yet not for play/pause the media.\n\n(Log out and in to activate the new settings.)  \nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/113897/how-to-remove-media-players-from-ubuntus-sound-menu-add-your-own/\n\n", "Q: How can I fix my KDE theme after upgrading to Kubuntu 13.04?

Note that if you do not suffer from the UEFI issue, you only need to install Ubuntu. The grub will simply work and grab the Windows 8 partition. Tested on way too many computers / laptops.\nIf you however, did it backwards, with this I mean, you have Ubuntu and installed Windows afterwards. Then you need to follow the answers found in How can I repair grub? (How to get Ubuntu back after installing Windows?)\nIn any case, since 13.04 came out, I recommend using 13.04 over 12.04. You will have better support for issues like this, more hardware support, more fixes, optimizations and more. For a brief explanation of why I would suggest to go with the 13.04 release please read install 13.04 or stay with 12.04 LTS?\n\nA: Installing any dual-boot operating system setup should not be done without having a good backup and recovery strategy. Most OEM computers come with full restore capabilities and you can create repair discs beforehand. Data can be backed up. While in most cases, this is unnecessary, it pays to be careful. \nUnfortunately there are some issues with UEFI and dual booting which can be seen in the [Boot-Repair] Graphical tool to repair the PC boot in 1 click! thread on ubuntuforums.org (it's long so look from the back).

I was curious to know if the firewall on that one is activated (I have to turn it on each time I'm on the computer) along with the antivirus system, if not, should I download AVG and Firestarter? \n\nA: No I don't think so, it is a different operating system so those applications won't startup.  You'll need to install the linux equivalents if you want an anti-virus and firewall.\n\nA: Short answer:\nNo it won't be activated, but you don't need them.  If you need a firewall, install gufw and configure your rules with it.\n\nLong Answer:\nWindows and Ubuntu are separate entities.  If you are using a dual boot type (or even Wubi), the Windows firewall and antivirus will NOT protect you from viruses.\nHowever, in Ubuntu, there's almost no need for antivirus.  There is no real need for antivirus in Linux because most viruses on the internet are written to target Windows or Mac.  There are very few linux viruses that can affect every Linux operating system out there, so there's really only a very very very tiny chance you'll ever need to be devirusing your Linux.\nYou should at least configure a firewall, though.

Would this work for both Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04LTS? \nI understand how to mount the drive, etc. My question is not one of how to use/mount a hard-drive; but a question of how would Ubuntu treat a file system that is organized according to an operating system that is not the version that the drive is being mounted to.\n\nA: There will be no problem whatsoever in using the drive in Ubuntu (or any other Linux distribution, for that matter), as it can easily see and mount ext4 filesystems (as used by default in Ubuntu). To use with Windows, however, you would either have to format it to something like FAT or NTFS (therefore loosing the data in it), or use a program to manipulate ext4 partitions inside Windows (like Ext2read). In my opinion, the first method is best, as I still haven't found a decent program to manage ext4 partitions for Windows. Just be sure to backup the relevant data from the drive using a Linux distribution before formatting the drive.\n", "Q: making a Live CD I am running Windows 7 Professional.

It is installed but will not open. Any help? So I just upgraded to 13.04. I had to do a fresh install because I was having problems updating from 12.04, so I lost all of my previous settings and programs. \nNow that 13.04 is up and running, I immediately installed Samba as it is how I stream my media to my WDTV Live. \nThe software center says that Samba has successfully installed and it appears in my dock, but when I click it it does not open.

I then have to go to the software center, uninstall Samba and reinstall it in order to get it to appear in my dock again. Of course, the problem persists. \nAny idea what the problem might be?\n\nA: I had the same problem.

Try installing Samba and using \"File\" (Nautilus) to access the network share. You may have to adjust the Samba settings but it generally worked for me out of the box (albeit in previous editions). In \"File\" you should specify a url like servername://Share_name/directory \n\nA: I had the same problem, but managed to fix it. It is happening because gksu is not installed in 13.04 by default, and dash presumably tries to run gksu system-config-samba, and does not find gksu.\nTo install gksu, open terminal and run:\nsudo apt-get install gksu\n\nThen type:\ngksu-properties\n\nIn the dialogue that follows set authentication mode to \"sudo\" and grab mode to \"enable\".\n", "Q: Can't Log in to Ubuntu-one I get:\n\"OpenID failed\nOpenID discovery error: HTTP Response status from identity URL host is not 200.

Use dbus.\nNext, put something in your script that detects running torrents. Here is a little something that uses trasmission-remote to count the number of torrents running that aren't \"Done\":\ntransmission-remote --list | sed '1d;$d' | grep -v Done | wc -l\n\nTo build that into your script:\ncount=$(transmission-remote --list | sed '1d;$d' | grep -v Done | wc -l)\nif [ $count -eq 0 ]; then\n    dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.Hal \\\n        /org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/computer \\\n        org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.SystemPowerManagement.Shutdown\nfi\n\nI'm not a transmission user so my search might be slightly off but this should do the job. You might find that it doesn't shut down all the time if there are some torrents in there that are, for example, paused. If that's the case, play around with the output and a grep -v clause or two to handle things.\nAdditionally, you might want a timed shutdown so you're never in a situation where the desktop shuts down while you're on it (so you can abort it). Perhaps just an additional check in there to see what the time is.\nNote: transmission-remote requires you turn on web access to transmission from within its options.\n\nA: Transmission offers an RPC interface that let's you communicate with Transmission programmatically. With that, you could write a script that is executed after one (any) torrent is finished downloading, as you do now. That scripts checks through the RPC interface if there are any other torrents still downloading. Only if none are found, the system is shut down, else the script exits without doing anything (and waits to be called again once the next torrent finishes). \nI'm not sure whether you can talk to the RPC interface in a bash script, but according to the Transmission Homepage there are \"remote control libraries\" to use in Ruby, Python, PHP or Perl.

It is related to the use of encryption of the $HOME folder. The wallpaper is loaded before the login process, not after you log in. Therefore, if your wallpaper is stored in your home directory, and if your home directory is encrypted, the login system is not able to read it. To solve this issue, simple store your wallpaper image in a non-encrypted home folder, let's say in /etc, and choose it as default wallpaper as described above.\n\nA: Here is how you change your background:\n1.Right click on the desktop, and click on Change Desktop Background.  Notice the purple background in the image below the menu.\n\n2.Choose an image from the displayed images, or add one of yours by clicking on the + sign.\n\n3.I choose the image that is pointed, and you can see that the background image has changed, and after re-booting the image stayed the same.\n\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 rhythmbox doesn't recognise title and artist I recently upgraded from Ubuntu 12.10 to 13.04.

The answer was easy that the first char has a bigger address.\nBut then I wrote a little test program:\n#include \"stdio.h\"\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    int a = 3;\n    int b = 4;\n\n    printf(\"Size a: %lu \\n\"\n           \"size b: %lu \\n\",\n           sizeof(a),\n           sizeof(b));\n\n    printf(\"Address a: %p \\n\"\n           \"Address b: %p \\n\",\n           (void *)&a,\n           (void *)&b);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\nOutput:\nSize a: 4 \nsize b: 4 \nAddress a: 0x7fffa1eb8a98 \nAddress b: 0x7fffa1eb8a9c \n\nThe output was misleading, the second char address was bigger. I tried the same on a computer at my university and there was everything okay.\nDo you know why this is so?\nI'm on Ubuntu 13.04 64bit.\n\nA: I don't think I understand why there's a problem but I think GCC might have something to do with it... Here's a comparison between GCC and Clang.\n$ gcc -o test.gcc test.c\n$ ./test.gcc\nSize a: 4 \nsize b: 4 \nAddress a: 0x7fffeef71488 \nAddress b: 0x7fffeef7148c \n\n\n$ clang++ -o test.clang test.c \n$ ./test.clang \nSize a: 4 \nsize b: 4 \nAddress a: 0x7fff664573f8 \nAddress b: 0x7fff664573f4\n\nThe compiler and its version you're using at uni may be the variable element here.\n\nA: The C standard as defined by Kernighan & Ritchie in their book \"The C Programming Language\" does not define how parameters are passed to functions, not does it define how local variables are stored which leaves it implementation defined.\nThe documentation for your compiler should tell you how parameters are passed because otherwise you can't write assembly code to link in with it.  For local variables there are even fewer constraints as these will only be accessed from within the function so the compiler may decide not to store the variable in memory at all it could keep it in a register.  As you asked for the address of the variable the compiler has been forced to store it in memory but unless you use a pointer to a particular variable it is not required to.\nTwo different compilers can do things differently.  A lot of compilers choose to use the stack but others will use registers instead where this is possible and even where they do use the stack the order of parameters is down to the implementation.\nThe ANSI C standard as not changed this.\nIn short Ubuntu does not store variables in the wrong order.  The compiler you use in Ubuntu just stores them in a different order than the one you use at university.  Neither is wrong.  They are just different and the compiler documentation should explain how its implemented.\nFor gcc, which is what most people use in Linux the documentation is here.\n", "Q: Desktop Display shows as laptop and resolution mismatch with monitor I have been using Ubuntu 12.04 without problem.

I installed Ubuntu 12.04 server on a Gigabyte GA-H61M-USB3 motherboard. This all went well. I subsequently installed Apache, MySQL and PHP. This also went well. I am using the UFW kernal firewall instead of the recommended Shorewall (could not find the repository during installation). I thought I had a working server until I relocated the box and attempted to log in using PuTTY. Turns out that the server does not boot without a monitor and keyboard connected. I don't believe there is anything in the motherboard that is preventing the boot. Has anyone else seen this behavior and what was your fix. Thanks.\n\nA: Have you verified that the system does not boot? For example add something like\n    date>>/iamalive\n\nto /etc/rc.local and check that file after reboot. \nAre you using the correct IP to connect via Putty (static vs dhcp configuration)?\n", "Q: Do I have a broken Ubuntu 13.04 installation? I have installed Ubuntu 13.04 in my home(32 bits) and in my office desktop (64 bits). The one at my home was upgraded to 13.04 from 12.10 (the actual install was 11.04 and all the version were upgraded) while On office machine I have installed from downloaded fresh iso of 13.04. \nAt my home I see Ubuntu offering me regular updates sometimes even twice a day whereas the office machine has never offered any update so far. Since I have been using Ubuntu for few years now I can sense that there is something broken in Ubuntu 13.04 installation at office i.e. Empathy doesn't showup in message menu, Ubuntu One icon is not there in taskbar etc. No matter how many times I start Software updater it never shows me any update ? How can I fix that ? See screenshot\n\n\nA: I don't know that I have a \"fix\", but here are some things to try or consider:\n1.) Did you check the md5 sum of the 64-bit .iso you downloaded? (http://releases.ubuntu.com/raring/MD5SUMS) A corrupted download or a compromised HDD can result in broken installation media. (Speaking of which, using the Disk Utility, is your office PC's HDD SMART Data good?)\nBTW, you can check the md5 of a file by opening a terminal (Ctrl+alt+T), change directory to the folder of the file (type: cd path/of/file/), then type md5sum filename.iso. (Insert the correct folder path and filename as needed, of course.) You can copy, paste, and compare the result in a text file with the md5 provided by Ubuntu/Canonical. I keep all of my .iso files alongside such a .txt file.\n2.)Assuming the .iso that you're using for your install medium (CD-R/DVD/USB) checks out, can you find updates using the live environment (i.e., running from the installation medium)? If not, you may have a faulty USB, disc burner, CD-R, etc. There used to be a \"check disc integrity\" feature after booting an install disc, but I don't know if it's still available, or if it's automatic now.\n3.) If it does access updates in the live environment, you may be best off reinstalling your office system. I've not reinstalled a new Ubuntu system, but I presume the old behavior is still true: installing over the same partition without formatting will clear and replace system files, but not /home personal files.

The one you have has been built with the option CONFIG_DRIVER_NL80211 set to N, rather than Y.\nThere are simple and detailed instructions how to rebuild it here → Hostapd building instruction. Rebuild it with the option enabled.

It should be in UNIX format as < LF > and not < CR >< LF >.\nThat fixed mine error.\n\nA: I had a similar Problem, but without the spaces after the values and managed to solve it:\nBefore I encountered the Problem, I copied the hostapd.conf file from my Windows pc onto my Raspberry Pi. And I believe the problem was, that the text had special characters. Maybe some returns were different (Because I had a return instead of a space after the values in the errors)  \nBut enough speculation, let's come to my solution:\n\n\n*\n\n*I renamed the old hostapd.conf file (to hostapdOld.conf)\n\n*I created a new file with the name hostapd.conf\n\n*And then I copied the whole content of the old file to the new one. (I just selected the whole text, didn't use Ctrl+A, if this even matters)\n\n\nThen I ran hostapd as usual, with:\nsudo hostapd -d /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf\n\nAnd it worked again\n", "Q: Does installed from source software get overwritten by automatic updates? As an example I've installed libcurl v7.30 from source, using their tutorial:\n./configure --disable-ipv6 --enable-ares\n make\n make install\n\nI've had libcurl installed from the official repository prior to this.\nWould the install be overwritten by automatic updates? If yes what is the proper way to install from source and not mess with official installations. \nIf the package is already installed should it be removed before a new install? \nI guess an alternative would be to install in a diferent folder, but how wouldn this change usage? (in my case compiling) and would it cause problems with references?\n\nA: For the most part, software installed from the repository can and sometimes will overwrite source-built software. If you want to stop this from happening (i.e. have another source built version lingering on your system, and easy to remove), then continue reading. It is always advisable to set up the source build so that it installs to a different directory. If you want to get the Ubuntu version of the software back, you run\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall libcurl3\n\nFirst of all, you should read the README or INSTALL file of the source code to understand the parameters. That way, you absolutely know the parameter to parse and to which command you should send it to. But below is a generic way that works on most source builds in my (admittedly) limited experience\nCompiling from source\nSince the best practice is to use checkinstall, we will install this first:\nsudo apt-get install checkinstall\n\nThis will make your life easier when removing compiled packages, as noted by apmouse.\nQuite often a parameter for ./configure is --prefix <directory> and is used like this:\nauto-apt run ./configure --prefix=/opt/libcurl\n\nand then you do the rest of the source build dance:\nmake\nsudo checkinstall\n\nand the make command will create the directory and install your files for you. \nRemoving the built package\nIf you ever need to remove your source files, you can just run:\nsudo dpkg -r libcurl\n\nIf you need the files to be accessible from the terminal, then look at this AskUbuntu question for some ideas on how to add your new path to the $PATH variable.\n", "Q: How I can set program autostart to my second desktop?

Then add these lines:\nLEFT seek -1\nRIGHT seek +1\n\nYou'd think that SMPlayer would also honour these controls or have an input.conf file of its own, but as far as I can tell, it does not.\n\nA: Definitely VLC:\nhttp://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html\nyou can advance speed of sound towards picture, subs etc\nUsing VLC you have the advantage of having a media player that opens a large number of media types and that of being able to use your preferred text editor, word processor or desktop publishing program.\nYou can assign \"global shortcut keys\" in VLC to control the media file while your text editor window is focused, even if the VLC window is under other windows of in a different workspace (VLC > Preferences > Show settings: simple > Hotkeys).\nYou have 4 types of jumps (very short, short, medium, long) to move backwards or forward along the timeline and you can set how many seconds each of this jump is long (VLC > Tools > Preferences > Show settings: all > Interface > Hotkeys settings).\nYou can also assign hotkeys to control the volume and the playback speed, as well as have a single shortcut key to play/pause or two separate, one for play and one for pause.\n\nA: Audacity  \nIt not only has by default the left/right keys set for 1-second jump, but this and the other possible jumps are editable. Also, this is an audio editing program, with enhanced control and features needed for such activity as transcription (like removing background noise!)\n\n\nBy default the  Space key is not set to pause, but to Stop/Play, so it restarts from initial point. Pause is P. But this is customizable.\n\nI looked up Foobar2000/Wine and it has the option of 1-sec key jump (but the Pause command is not set by default so it too has to be set manually.)\n\n\nA: Playitslowly \nThis fine software does most you need for transcription of audio files to text. It has the following features:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Plays every file gstreamer does (mp3, ogg vorbis, midi, even flv!)  \n  \n*Can use alsa and jack  \n  \n*Change speed and pitch  \n  \n*Loop over certain parts  \n  \n*Export to wav\n  \n  \n  Source: Developer's Blog\n\nThe following keyboard shortcuts will let you control playback:\nAlt + P -  Pause/Play\nAlt + E - Rewind to zero\nCtrl + 0 - 9 - Rewind n seconds  \n\n\nA: I would recommend VLC Media Player. It Plays almost every format out there and you can jump to a specific time by pressing ctrl + T.\nAlso look at the SMPlayer. Though i'm not so familiar with it I heard it is also a great player.  \nVLC Media Player\nSMPlayer\nUpdate: \nYou should have a look at Avidemux. It looks really good. As far as I can see you can make 2 selections and jump to them using ctrl + [ for A and ctrl + ] for B...\nYou can download it in the Ubuntu Software Center. \n", "Q: Gmail WebApp 13.04 I've made a clean install of 13.04 64-bit on a Dell Vostro 3500 i5 4gb RAM. The apps are working properly when installed after the Firefox requests, only Gmail (which was a troubled app for some systems on previous versions also) doesn't appear on Unity and on the Messaging Menu. I've tried to reinstall the app via Synaptic, but no results. Would there already be a way to solve this in 13.04? Thanks in advance.\n\nA: In case you want to retry adding the Gmail Unity webapp from firefox: execute  sudo apt-get purge unity-webapps-gmail, restart firefox and surf to https://gmail.com. You should see the dialog asking to install the gmail webapp.\nI'm experiencing the same issue, one thing I've noticed is that the file ~/.local/share/applications/GMailmailgooglecom.desktop was missing on my system. I created it and populated it with (you can create it by running unity-webapps-desktop-file /usr/share/unity-webapps/userscripts/unity-webapps-gmail/manifest.json in ~/.local/share/applications):\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=GMail\nType=Application\nIcon=GMail-mail.google.com\nMimeType=\nActions=S0;S1;S2;S3;S4;S5;S6;S7;S8;S9;S10;\nExec=unity-webapps-runner -n 'R01haWwA' -d 'mail.google.com' %u\n\nI also added a row for the GMail app to the applications table in ~/.local/share/unity-webapps/apps2.db and checked that the necessary values are present in dconf-editor (as suggested by sorgel).\nAfter restarting unity I do have a GMail icon on my Unity launcher and the messages menu, the icon itself however is displayed as a question mark. Clicking the question mark in the launcher always opens a new firefox window (i.e. it doesn't switch to an existing tab if present); also the number of unread mails isn't displayed either. \nSo for me the webapp basically doesn't work. The Facebook, twitter and Youtube webapps do seem to be operating as expected. Filing a bug report would probably be the next step.\n\nA: Visit http://gmail.com and your browser will ask you to install it, accept and it will pop the dialog to login and allow the app to access gmail info. Fill that in and let it do its magic work. You can add it manually via system settings >>Online Accounts\nOnce you visit gmail it will showup!\nI tried it on my 13.04 with Firefox 20 and it works fine.\n", "Q: A php script that I want it be run by Transmission client! In transmission-gtk there is an option can run script: Edit > Preferences > Downloading > Call script when torrent is completed.\nRecently, I found this script that I do not know how to make it work under transmission. According to the program description, the script does not turn off the system, but it can kill transmission after all torrents are done. that's enough for me because I can chain \"turning off\" to \"closing transmission\" by &&.\nNow, may you, guys, help me to run this php script under transmission? \nthis is an example mentioned by the script author:\nphp.exe Transmission_Quit.php --port=9999 --hostname=192.168.0.1; what does this mean?! how should I use it? Should I point it to \"Call script when torrent is completed\" option directly? \n\nA: I am leaving this in order to follow up the original question which is asking to run a specific php script. But a workaround is provided in the New Recipe section in order to solve the main problem.\nPlease try this and inform on your results, after which this answer may be changed or deleted:\nAt a certain moment your password may be asked.\n\n\n*\n\n*First of all, let's create a file called script.php by dropping in a\nterminal sudo gedit script.php (remember that you can drop this\nfile in whatever folder you wish but for testing purposes your home\nfolder will be good).\n\n*In the file, let's copy/paste the contents of the script that you\nmention. Save the file and close it down.\n\n*Now let's give the file the proper file permissions and the\nexecution permission also by dropping the next two lines in a\nterminal, one line at once.\nsudo chmod 755 script.php\nsudo chmod a+x script.php\n\n*Now, let's install php5-cli by dropping in a terminal sudo apt-get\ninstall php5-cli and let's wait the terminal to finish the install\nprocess.\nOnce php5-cli is installed we can test the script by invoking php script.php  --port=9999 --hostname=192.168.0.1; in a terminal, but it will be better if you do it from inside of Transmission.\nphp5-cli is a command line interpreter for the PHP5 Scripting Language and it is useful to run php scripts like this, it is more like the php.exe file for Windows, the one that you refer on your original question.\nI hope you succeed but please inform on your results in order to provide the proper support or delete this answer if not useful.\nAddendum\nAfter reading your comments, I give you this fast-food recipe for the php script.\nFirst of all I need to explan certain things of the example given by the script's author, as follows:\nscript.php  --port=9999 --hostname=192.168.0.1;\n\n\n\n*\n\n*--port=9999 = 9999 is an example port, but in this field you should\nwrite the same port number that you define on the Web client tab.\n\n*--hostname=192.168.0.1 = Must be the ip of the equipment that you wish the script run to kill transmission's process.\n\n\nThis makes me think that the process can be invoked remotely but for our particular case we are going to use the default values so that we need not to include neither the port nor the hostname. By simply running the script.php file in a terminal or invoked by transmission and it's going to use the default values which apply to our computer (localhost).\nThen, let's cook fast food:\n\n\n*\n\n*We need a file, let's call it bye.sh and place it somewhere, your\nhome folder is a good place for testing purposes.\n\n*Insert the next inside of the file (fast food script here),\nsave it, close it and give it execution permissions. (for reference,\ngo down on this answer and find how).\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Then, serve it inside of your Transmission \"Download\" tab but make\nsure you include the proper bye.sh file to be invoked when the\ndownload finishes.\n\n\n\nThat's it. I need to explain that somehow, the php script is succeeding but it observes a small delay after the downloads finishes and I have just tested with 2 small torrent files. I can't say if the delay will increase if the list is longer or the download size is heavier, behavior that is not observed by the New Recipe formula. However, the PHP file gives you the warranty that it's going to run in whatever OS that is PHP capable, and my New Recipe is mostly intended for Linux Based Systems, it works on Ubuntu and may succeed in other distributions, Debian or Ubuntu based, and certain modifications will allow it to succeed in other non Debian/Ubuntu based distributions.\nGood luck!\nNew Recipe\nOK I have a new recipe for this case, I admit it got all my attention, even when I don't use Transmission so often.\nThe Recipe\nIngredients\n\n\n*\n\n*transmission-gtk (installed somehow, from the software bag,\nterminal, etc.)\n\n*transmission-cli (sudo apt-get install transmission-cli, provide\npassword, wait the install to finish.)\n\n*The Script. (cooked apart)\n\n\nPreparation\n\n\n*\n\n*Let's prepare our transmission in order to receive web client\npetitions from outside, this way we can monitor what is happening in\nour program. Let's open Transmission and go to the \"Web\" tab in order\nto enable the \"Enable web client\" checkbox as shown in the next\nscreenshot.\n\n\n\n(Default values will do the trick perfectly)\n\n\n*\n\n*Let's open our favorite text editor in order to create a file named\nbyebye.sh and let's place the next contents inside. (See the script here)\n\n\n\nNow, let's find the bybye.sh file and give it the proper execution permissions by dropping in a terminal sudo chmod a+x bybye.sh or by entering the file properties in Nautilus and activating the \"Allow executing file as program\" checkbox in the \"Permissions\" as shown in the next screenshot.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Once we cooked out the script, let's install transmission-cli, in a\nterminal drop: sudo apt-get install transmission-cli, hit Enter and\nprovide your password, after which the software will be installed.\n\n\nTime for tasting\nIn a terminal, drop transmission-remote --list | sed '1d;$d' | grep -v Done | wc -l after which the results may vary from case to case, depending on the amount of torrents that are pending or currently downloading in transmission. If the results is different than 0 we're on our way. If you receive 0 and something is downloading or in queue, you must check the recipe from the beginning. If you receive an error please drop it in a comment in order to provide support.\n\n\n*\n\n*If everything is going fine, now let's instruct transmission to run\nthe script everytime a torrent is completed. CALM DOWN! Please,\ncalm... the script will run each time a torrent is completely\ndownload, but it will only trigger the action to terminate\ntransmission just when the results of downloads equals zero. This\nconditional way give us the tranquility that transmission won't close\ndown on each download. A screenshot is provided for your convenience:\n\n\n\nAnd voila! The recipe can be served in generous portions and in company of all your downloads. Transmission will close down just if the last download succeeded.\nSOME WARNINGS\nIf Transmission is having only one pending action and the download finishes at the very moment of the software's opening, Transmission is going to close as soon as it opens.\nGlossary:\nkillall -9 transmission = Will close transmission in a gently mode so that you won't receive an error message each time it is closed. By simply using killall transmission is going to close it in an rude way thus the software will report a close failure.\nNow, make sure you include a glass with excellent Cuban rum for me in the table when serving the recipe and...\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Run system commands from QML App I want to run a system command from inside my application. It's suppose to run a command on a remote server using SSH. But that's not really the point. The point is that I don't know how to run any kind of command from the app. I asked in the mail list and they referred me to build a QML extension using C++. But I don't know C++ and it seems that I have to learn so much only to run a simple command.\nIn Python (as in PHP) it's easy to run a system command. Is there any other way of doing it in my Touch app, or is there someone that could help me even more? Or perhaps have a better solution to my problem?\n\nA: Ubuntu 14.04\nThe concept of QProcess Launcher type is now working without problems in Trusty with ubuntu-sdk-team PPA. Just create QML Extension Library + Tabbed UI project (don't use hyphens in project name yet), replace contents of \nmytype.h\n#ifndef LAUNCHER_H\n#define LAUNCHER_H\n\n#include <QObject>\n#include <QProcess>\n\nclass Launcher : public QObject\n{\n    Q_OBJECT\n\npublic:\n    explicit Launcher(QObject *parent = 0);\n    ~Launcher();\n    Q_INVOKABLE QString launch(const QString &program);\n\nprotected:\n    QProcess *m_process;\n};\n\n#endif // LAUNCHER_H\n\nmytype.cpp\n#include \"mytype.h\"\n\nLauncher::Launcher(QObject *parent) :\n    QObject(parent),\n    m_process(new QProcess(this))\n{\n\n}\n\nQString Launcher::launch(const QString &program)\n{\n    m_process->start(program);\n    m_process->waitForFinished(-1);\n    QByteArray bytes = m_process->readAllStandardOutput();\n    QString output = QString::fromLocal8Bit(bytes);\n    return output;\n}\n\nLauncher::~Launcher() {\n\n}\n\nand change qmlRegisterType in the backend.cpp to \nqmlRegisterType<Launcher>(uri, 1, 0, \"Launcher\");\n\nNext, just clean all MyType remains from QML files and add\n        Rectangle {\n\n          Launcher {\n             id: qprocess\n          }\n\n          Text {\n            anchors.centerIn: parent\n            text: qprocess.launch(\"which bash\")\n          }\n        }\n\nwherever you like and \nimport projectname 1.0\n\nin the beginning.\nOptional\nI also use this wrapper:\nfunction exec(command) {\n    return qprocess.launch(\"sh -c \\\"\" + command + \" < /dev/null \\\"\")\n}\n\nIf you need root access, add pkexec.\n\nA: You really don't need to know a lot about c++ to get access to terminal commands. Just put the following in any file ending with .cpp, for instance runPython.cpp.\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint main ()\n{\n    system(\"cd /home/user/path/to/script\");\n    system(\"python3 myScript.py\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\nAll you have to find out now is how to get the c++ code running in QML but I'm sure that's very well documented.\nNote that you can add any linux command you like by following the same syntax system(\"linux command\");.\nHope this helps!\n\nA: This isn't something that QML supports, the typical answer is to write a C++ plugin to handle that kind of thing.\nHowever, the SDK team is planning out various extensions to provide to QML app developers, and this may be something that they implement in a generic plugin that you can use.\n\nA: Update: For 14.04 see the much simplified answer by int_ua.\nOriginal Text:\nAt http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=87580 there is a basic overview of how to add the extension to QML. I decided to give it a shot using the ubuntu-sdk instead, which is slightly different. I'll document below.\nFor this project I selected Ubuntu Touch/Simple UI with C++ Backend in QtCreator. This creates a project with two separate parts, the backend and the touchui frontend written in QML. To the backend we are going to add two files for the Launcher class.\nlauncher.h:\n#ifndef LAUNCHER_H\n#define LAUNCHER_H\n\n#include <QObject>\n#include <QProcess>\n\nclass Launcher : public QObject\n{\n    Q_OBJECT\npublic:\n    explicit Launcher(QObject *parent = 0);\n    Q_INVOKABLE QString launch(const QString &program);\n\nprivate:\n    QProcess *m_process;\n};\n\n#endif // LAUNCHER_H\n\nlauncher.cpp:\n#include \"launcher.h\"\n\nLauncher::Launcher(QObject *parent) :\n    QObject(parent),\n    m_process(new QProcess(this))\n{\n}\n\nQString Launcher::launch(const QString &program)\n{\n    m_process->start(program);\n    m_process->waitForFinished(-1);\n    QByteArray bytes = m_process->readAllStandardOutput();\n    QString output = QString::fromLocal8Bit(bytes);\n    return output;\n}\n\nThis class simply uses QProcess to execute a program, waits for it to finish, reads its stdout, and returns it as a string.\nNext we need to modify backend/backend.cpp to include the class. This requires two lines. Append an include:\n#include \"launcher.h\"\n\nand in BackendPlugin::registerTypes add a line:\nqmlRegisterType<Launcher>(uri, 1, 0, \"Launcher\");\n\nThere should already be a line for MyType, which is the included example. After this we should be able to build the backend. The only thing that remains is to use it in the main.qml file. For this I added a line:\nLauncher { id: myLauncher }\n\nand to the Button's onClick handler, set:\nmyType.helloWorld = myLauncher.launch(\"date\");\n\nAt this point all that remains is to start it up and test it out. Here is where I ran into a problem, since QtCreator doesn't seem to set everything up properly by default. As I workaround, in the terminal navigate to your QtCreator project directory and:\nmkdir -p Ubuntu/Example\n\nThen copy the libUbuntuExample.so file from ProjectBuildDir/backend to Ubuntu/Example, and the qmldir file from ProjectName/backend/qmldir. Then you can run:\nqmlscene -I . ProjectName/touchui/main.qml\n\nI'm sure there is probably a simple way to rig this all up so Build/Run just works.\n\nA: You shall use PlasmaCore.DataSource with the engine \"executable\", as in this example.\nMind that the call is asynchronous. Hence the command sends a signal when it finishes, and a different part of the code picks the signal and continues with the next step you want to perform.\n", "Q: How do I get my shared disk back on line in Ubuntu 13.04 I have a folder on my disk which I share over the LAN so my wife can do backups to it. It has worked since I can remember. Now I've updated to 13.04 and suddenly I no longer see it or even my computer over the LAN.\nI am referring to File (or Nautilus) where I press the Browse Network button. I used to see my own machine and hers, and of course the shared folder.\nI tried to remove sharing from the file and then reshare it. I did a log out, log in but still no sign of my computer or the shared folder. I see her computer but not my own and of course she fails to see my computer as well.\nI assume samba is working or I would have received a message when I did the reshare. The problem began after the upgrade to 13.04. Any suggestions?\nThanks,\nIlan\n\nA: I suspected that maybe samba was broken so I went into synaptic and completely removed it.\nJust to be sure I did log out/log in after each critical step.\nThen I reinstalled samba and if I remember correctly at this stage at least my computer reappeared when I hit Browse Network inside Nautilus (it may have appeared at a later stage).\nThe Sharing Options upon a right click was no longer available and the critical point here is to use synaptic to install nautilus-share. It probably was removed when I removed samba.\nFinally I had a password problem in that I couldn't open the folder which I wanted to share to my wife. The point here is to use a terminal and type shares-admin. Unlock it and in the Users tab I saw my login user name, so I checked it and set my login password.\nAfter that I was back on line. How it got broken in the first place is still a mystery, but at least my shared folder in now back on line.\n", "Q: How to set proxy settings in ubuntu software center? I have been using windows 7 and to update windows i configured netsh winhttp settings by using command: netsh winhttp set proxy 10.0.0.21:3128.

Is there a way i can put proxy settings  throughout the computer that would work for software center and other softwares?\n\nA: As Mahyar Pasarzangene said, you can set the proxy using System settings -> Network -> Network Proxy and then choosing \"Manual\" proxy and setting your host and port no. and then applying the settings system-wide.\nHowever, if you are using authenticated proxy, i.e. you have a username and password for your proxy, you need to set it as follows:\nOpen a terminal(Ctrl+Alt+t) and then type the following:\nsudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf\n\nand set your username and password as follows:\nAcquire::http::proxy \"http://username:password@host:port_no/\";\nAcquire::https::proxy \"https://username:password@host:port_no/\";\nAcquire::ftp::proxy \"ftp://username:password@host:port_no/\";\nAcquire::socks::proxy \"socks://username:password@host:port_no/\";\n\nYou will not have username@password when you open this document, but you should put your username and password as shown above, separated by a : and then separated by @ with the host.\nIf you have any special characters in your password, replace it with its HTML code.\n\nA: Yes , Go to Settings -> Network -> Network Proxy -> Manual -> Apply System Wide\n\nA: if you are using authenticated proxy then you can use this trick \nFirst go to Sytem settings -> Network -> Network Proxy\nchoose \"Manual\" and write\nuser:pass@proxy (NOT ONLY PROXY)in proxy column and port in the port column.\nApply the settings system wide.\nThis may solve your problem.\n", "Q: Vostro 3560 sound is not working after upgrade to Ubuntu 13.04?

(NetConnect)\nI have searched on google and all I could find was the acceptance that getting that Juniper network software to be configured correctly and working is difficult.\nBut that was some time ago. Has someone tackled that problem? Or can someone help me get it cracked?\nAlternate softwares/methods that get me connected to the work network are also welcomed.\n\nA: Juniper should work out of the box for 32 bit Ubuntu 13.04 and OpenJDK 7.\nYou will need to install the OpenJDK JRE and the icedtea plugin. For 64bit version you need both 64bit Java (to be used as default) as well as 32 bit Java. See Juniper setup on 12.04 for details. \nWhen you start Juniper for the first time you will get a couple of pop-ups. Click Always Trust button for the first and in the terminal type pop-up enter the sudo password as requested. \nThen the Network Connect Window will popup. If the Network Connect Window opens and closes, you probably have icedtea-6-plugin installed together with (or instead of) icedtea-7-plugin. Remove the icedtea-6-plugin.\nWait till the connection is complete and all the fields including the IP address are populated. Now you are ready to connect to your office computer.\nFor RDP\nOpen remmina from the Dash and enter the remote computer's ID, user ID, password, and domain name. You may want to use the same settings as the RDP client in Windows.\nIf you get the error \"Uable to connect to RDP server\", delete the entry from ~/.freerdp/known_hosts. See Cannot RDP to Windows 7 with Remmina on 12.04.\nFor Citrix\nIf your office's Juniper web page includes a link to connecting to a virtual server using the Citrix Java version, then you should be able to able to click on the link and connect once the Juniper Connect makes the connection.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Is it possible to use both SLI and two monitors at the same time on Ubuntu with Nvidia?

On both machines I have 3 monitors connected.\nTo make this work I had to configure each monitor on there own xserver.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Nvidia X Server Settings → X Server Display Configuration: select the monitor which is disabled or hidden behind the other monitor.\n\n*In the Configuration pull down menu add new xserver. Also enable the Xinerama check box.\n\n*Drag the screen to fit your need.\n\n*The next is important: Click Save to X Configuration File and save the configuration in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.\n\n\nYou will have to restart the Display Manager or reboot your computer.\nIf any thing goes wrong you can always delete the /etc/X11/xorg.conf and reboot.\nSome times (not very often) have I problems with the display configuration. Then the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file is renamed by system to something like /etc/X11/xorg.conf.062914. To fix it just copy: sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf.062914 /etc/X11/xorg.conf and reboot\nYou will often see application complain about XRAND is missing but it will not give any problems.

Before, the launcher was called \"Home Folder\", although a \"Files\" launcher also existed that ran the same app. However, in 13.04, the one pinned to the launcher is the \"Files\" one. \nSo the Home Folder is probably displaying the icon it says it is - the home folder.

Ubuntu, debian, fedora ect)\ng: 3tb random stuff\n\nI want Ubuntu and grub on drive D but I want to boot my computer normally and only boot into grub and Ubuntu when I do an advanced startup and select an alternative boot device (the 1tb hard drive). Is this possible with Ubuntu and other Linux distributions? Also do all distributions require you to make a Linux swap partition?\nOh and lastly could I multiboot different distributions such as slackware and archlinux on the D drive and have grub come up with all the os's on the D drive when I boot from it? Even multiboot stuff like older versions of windows and DOS or even hackintosh? \n\nA: 1. Of course you can install Ubuntu on Hard Disk Drive D (I am not talking about \nlogical disk drive). While installing Ubuntu, it would\noffer a page, in which you select the Hard Drive on which the OS\nshould be installed. This option is there in pretty much all the\noperating system installers.\n\n2. You can even install multiple operating systems on the same drive (D), the \nbootloader corresponding to the last operating system which you install on that \ndrive will show up and list all the operating systems available on that drive.\n\n3.

The link in the other answer weighs the pros and cons of sharing a swap partition.\n\nA: What you want to do is install ubuntu on your 'd:' drive, and put grub on it. not c:, but d:.

To give a brief environment overview, I am running MAAS on Ubuntu Server 13.04 with the IP 10.0.0.10 and juju and juju-core are running on the same server. This is all run in a localized test lab too. Issuing a juju status reveals the following:\nroot@maas:~# juju status\n2013-04-30 10:24:32,876 INFO Connecting to environment...\n2013-04-30 10:24:33,439 INFO Connected to environment.\nmachines:\n  0:\n    agent-state: not-started\n    dns-name: test4.master\n    instance-id: /MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-ee044686-b100-11e2-9927-52540089abb8/\n    instance-state: unknown\n  5:\n    instance-id: pending\nservices:\n  mysql:\n    charm: cs:precise/mysql-19\n    relations: {}\n    units:\n      mysql/0:\n        agent-state: pending\n        machine: 5\n        public-address: null\n2013-04-30 10:24:33,496 INFO 'status' command finished successfully\n\nThe instance remains in a pending state indefinitely and a look at the debug log reveals that a connection is not being made to provision the instance:\n2013-04-30 10:27:26,562: juju.agents.provision@ERROR: Cannot get machine list\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/juju/agents/provision.py\", line 175, in process_machines\n    provider_machines = yield self.provider.get_machines()\nProviderInteractionError: Unexpected ConnectionRefusedError interacting with provider: Connection was refused by other side: 111: Connection refused.\n\nNow since this error is being generated on machine \"0\" every minute or so, I looked at a tcpdump to try and find out what was happening.

To troubleshoot the issue, I created a SSH tunnel on machine \"0\" listening on port 80 (localhost) to the MAAS server port 80, e.g. 80:MAAS-Server-IP:80. After that, juju status changed to show the new machine out of the pending state:\n  5:\n    agent-state: not-started\n    dns-name: test5.master\n    instance-id: /MAAS/api/1.0/nodes/node-fe882bb2-b100-11e2-ba1c-52540089abb8/\n    instance-state: unknown\n\nAll this to say, can someone please help me understand why the deployed machine \"0\" is attempting a connection to localhost port 80 rather than the MAAS server? Is this due to the fact I am running Juju and MAAS on the same server?\n\nA: When an environment is bootstrapped, you must pay attention to the hostname in the environments.yaml, as it appears that is what is pushed out to subsequent machines. In my case, I had the server set to http://localhost:80/MAAS, thus causing machine \"0\", and any other machines for that matter, to attempt to make a connection to localhost and not the IP/hostname of the MAAS server. After destroying my environment, and bootstrapping it again with the server http://10.0.0.10:80/MAAS, everything seemed to deploy correctly. This is entirely an oversight on my part.\n", "Q: Calendar application with Google sync?

Why isn't Deja_dup removing the older files (> 1 month) to make space for the new backup?\n\nA: deja dup keeps always two full backups and their corresponding incremental backup chain. It only deletes old backups if there are more than two full backups. Maybe you don't have two full backups.\n", "Q: Run two commands sequentially using crontab My 3-year girl loves SuperTux. She can't control the mouse, so the game should run automatically on startup. After the game, the computer should shut down automatically.\nHowever when I put the below command in \"crontab -e\":\n@reboot env DISPLAY=:0.0 /usr/games/supertux2 && echo \"PASSWORD\" | sudo -S shutdown -h now\nThe first part runs the game on an old PC at boot time. I expected the second part of the command to turn off the computer when my girl exits the game but it isn't working.\nDoesn't the chain-command A && B mean when the A finished, start B?\nHow can I automate the powering off computer when the game is closed?\n\nA: Technically, A && B will only execute B when A is successful (exits with status of EXIT_SUCCESS, i.e. 0). Likewise, A || B will only execute B when A fails. Another option could be A; B which should execute B regardless of the exit status of A, but not until A has completed. I don't know how the games is currently exiting, but if it is not exiting with an EXIT_SUCCESS status, then B won't get executed.\nTo test this you can run the following commands and see which ones generate the string:\nperl -e 'exit 0' && echo \"exit was successful\"\nperl -e 'exit 0' || echo \"exit was successful\"\nperl -e 'exit 0'; echo \"exit was successful\"\nperl -e 'exit 1' && echo \"exit was failure\"\nperl -e 'exit 1' || echo \"exit was failure\"\nperl -e 'exit 1'; echo \"exit was failure\"\n\nFinally, you could create a shell script /usr/games/supertux2.sh:\n#!/bin/sh\n/usr/games/supertux2\necho \"PASSWORD\" | sudo -S shutdown -h now\n\nAnd then call that on reboot, rather than /usr/games/supertux2\n", "Q: special character and parsing BUG - Bashscript Failed to parse arguments: Argument to \"--command/-e\" is not a valid command: Text ended before matching quote was found for \".

Touch tablets and touch PCs are not really recommended BUT! it is possible depending on your brand.  I have a MSI board, so it worksish. Windows 8 got corrupted and grub won't work. This is however a problem with Ubuntu detecting RAID 0 on 2 hard drives on AHCI mode. Since you have a laptop externals are clunky to luge unless it's one of those fancy WD Passports (Looks awesome!). I think that booting to External will bypass UEFI or Grub. Tho this is not tested, installing with a Live CD and an External may work (I will test that later in theory it should). Make sure your external gets power (USBs may work only when in OS first then you can restart your computer). You can boot to USB (Live CD), install with \"Something Else\" and make sure you have the external selected. Partition with EXT4 (500GB recommended) and install. After install test with a one time boot to your external. If it loads then YAY! If your external is a eSATA then it will be easier, like SO MUCH EASIER. USB externals may work, which I was explaining the guide for. So I will easy it up\neSATA:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Live CD on a 2GB+ Flash Drive or a blank CD.\n\n*Boot to your USB after making sure that your eSATA is readable by your BIOS\n\n*Install with the option \"Something else\"\n\n*Go to the top right drop box thing and select your drive\n\n*Install!!!\n\n*When done you want to make sure that it boots to Ubuntu. To do that a One-Time Boot may be the best instead of full on BIOS (Later Windows 8 will be tested, so One Boot is key for ease)\n\n*Once tested if boots, restart your PC into Windows to test for corruption (it could happen so BACK YOUR DOCUMENTS!)\n\n*Have fun!!!\nUSB Externals like my USB 3.0 WD Backup might have a extra step:\n\n\n*\n\n*Format clean before installing on it. Make sure it's free space.\n\n*USB 3.0 IS NEEDED FOR SPEED! I can't stress this enough, 2.0 sucks on a OS boot. So you get 50% to 90% less speed on 2.0.

Try to use some distribution that containing Unix line endings.\n\nA: Provided the configure file already has execute permission, this happens when the config.log file has been created by another user or inaccessible (either you tried ./configure with sudo or somebody else has run the configure script already). Removing the config.log file should solve this. \n\nA: Sometimes such things happen when you extracting files from gzipped tarball with improper applications or(and) from another user. \nIn that case \"tar -xf ... \" solves the problem\n\nA: Just use sh ./configure.

Sometimes I like to have separate Dolphin instances running in my various Unity work spaces.  As it is, I can open an existing Dolphin instance, open the file menu, and select \"New Window\" to create a new Dolphin instance.  I can then move the new Dolphin instance to the appropriate workspace.\nI would rather, from appropriate workspace, right click the Dolphin file manager icon in the Unity launcher bar and select an option that says, \"New Window\".  Unfortunately, that option does not exist.\nI tried opening a terminal and entering the following commands:\ngsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites\ncd /usr/share/applications/\ngksudo gedit unity://expo-icon\n\nMy effort failed; Dolphin is not launched from a *.desktop file.  Can someone please tell me how to add a \"New Window\" option to the Dolphin icon in the Unity launcher?\n\nA: You can create a custom dolphin launcher with a quicklist entry to open a new window.\nCreate the launcher in ~/.local/share/applications:\ngedit  ~/.local/share/applications/dolphin.desktop\n\nCopy and paste the following text into the file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Dolphin (custom)\nExec=dolphin %i -caption \"%c\" %u\nIcon=system-file-manager\nType=Application\nX-DocPath=dolphin/index.html\nCategories=Qt;KDE;System;FileTools;FileManager;\nGenericName=File Manager\nTerminal=false\nMimeType=inode/directory;\nInitialPreference=10\n\nX-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts=OpenNewWindow\n\n[OpenNewWindow Shortcut Group]\nName=Open New Window\nExec=dolphin %u\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\nSave the file, exit gedit and search for your new launcher from the dash.

I'm comming from Windows 7, and something that I loved there was to Alt+Tab in any Game or video and switch to another app without problem.\nHere, I tried with Age of Mythology (Wine), that I play it a lot, and saw that it can't minimize it and switch to another app. Mouse pointer is in another side but you're seeing the game...\nI though that was Wine's bug, but now I tried with a Video with standard Ubuntu 13.04 Video player. When it's on full screen I try to Alt+Tab, Ctrl+Super+D, and some other commands and it can't minimize or switch. I only see bugs when trying.......\nIs not possible??? :O\n\nA: There is no standard way to switch out of fullscreen in Linux right now. Some apps will have a shortcut for it such as F11, Ctrl-f, Alt-Tab or Alt-Enter, but others do not and quitting them might be the only way and if they are buggy not even that might be possible.\nFor apps running in Wine there is however a workaround. If you run winecfg go to the Graphics tab and set Emulate a virtual desktop you can force all Windows applications to run in window mode. Furthermore you can use wmctrl to remove the borders of a window. I found that running applications in window mode and having this command bound to a key:\nwmctrl -r \":ACTIVE:\" -b toggle,fullscreen\n\nWorks quite well most of the time, as unlike fullscreen mode done by a game itself, this kind of fullscreen is done by the window manager and you retain normal Alt-Tab control. It however only works with games that run in the same resolution as your desktop.\nI have also written some tools to further tweak fullscreen behavior: \nhttps://github.com/Grumbel/fullscreen-tools\nBut they are not all that user-friendly, but might be interesting if you wanna tweak things a bit further, to disable decorations, keep a window on top and move it to 0,0 would look like this:\nwindowtool.py -d 0 -a 1 -m 0,0 ACTIVE\n\n", "Q: Second hard drive isn't showing up in the Asus BIOS but is showing up in Ubuntu disks application I built a computer for my music this weekend, I have a little problem though; my Seagate 1TB hard drive isn't showing up in the Asus BIOS screen when I connected it.

If I am renaming a bunch of files in Nautilus quickly, when I hit Enter the file jumps to its proper place alphabetically. But that means I have to go back and find the next file I wanted to rename.\nIs there any way to easily tab to the next file when renaming, like in Windows? I tried various keys but nothing works.\nNote: I am not looking for a batch renamer like the rename command, I am renaming a handful of files with no pattern to them.\n\nA: I'm afraid that's not possible with Nautilus right now, everything gets reordered every time you make a change. So, your only option is doing like totti says: choosing another kind of ordering so file order doesn't change if you rename a file.\nThat concerns Nautilus, though. Perhaps other file managers, like Dolphin or Thunar, allow the kind of behaviour you want, but I seriously doubt it...\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 will not shutdown I have just upgraded my computer from ubuntu 12.10 to ubuntu 13.04, and now when I go to turn off my computer, it will not shut down fully. The Power supply keeps running, even when it is \"off\"\nAny suggestions please?\n\nA: I modified the script responsible for sending the kill signal with allocated delay, /etc/init.d/sendsigs, and reduce the amount of time it does to kill the remaining processes in 2 iteration. Healthy or not it gets the job done on my system and is no longer hanging on shutdown and restart. \nBelow is a portion of the /etc/init.d/sendsigs with modification indicated by # <--- :\n# Kill all processes.\nlog_action_begin_msg \"Asking all remaining processes to terminate\"\nkillall5 -15 $OMITPIDS # SIGTERM\nlog_action_end_msg 0\nalldead=\"\"\nOMITPIDS0=\"$OMITPIDS\"\n#for seq in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10; do  # this is the original line\nfor seq in 1 2; do     # <--- the above line is replaced by this one.\n\nthen on the lower part of the script:\n# Upstart has a method to set a kill timeout and so the job author\n# may want us to wait longer than 10 seconds (as in the case of \n# mysql).

If your system still hangs on shutdown, you could always do it the hardware way, and hold your power button down for 5-10 seconds, and force the system to shutdown without getting an error or \"Unexpected shutdown\".\n\nA: Try opening Terminal and typing sudo shutdown now or sudo poweroff. \nYou will need to enter your administrator password.\n\nA: Check your BIOS if ACPI is enabled. ACPI is the Advanced Configuration and Power Interface and is used to tell the different devices in your computer to shut down (or not).\nIn this case it seems that the OS is installed with ACPI enabled and later is was disabled. I assume the signal is send to the BIOS to shut down, but the BIOS does not send the signal to the different devices...\nThe opposite is also possible (OS installed with ACPI enabled and later it is disabled).\n\nA: Try adding\nINIT_HALT=poweroff\n\nto \n/etc/default/halt\n\nthis worked for me in 13.10\n\nA: In addition to the answers already given:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try Pressing the Esc button during the shutdown when 'Ubuntu' appears on the screen to enable terminal messaging (if ESC does nothing, try F1, F2, or combining these keys with Alt, Ctrl and Left Shift). \nObserve where the system appears to be hanging or too slow, and state what messages were shown at the time. \n\n*Try the following command from a terminal screen:\nsync; sudo -P shutdown now\n\nIf shutdown is faster, then you probably have a several asynchronous disk writes waiting to be committed when you shutdown. \nIf so, you can limit this by placing commit=xx in the fstab options for the affected filesystem (with xx being the number of seconds between committing disk writes).\n\nA: Like many has suggested, I used the terminal console, but for many who I have introduced Linux, the black terminal screen scares them.\nI found an alternative that also works.

I don't know about 12.04.\n", "Q: How to make the Wacom Bamboo Splash Pen CTL-471 work on Lucid Lynx 10.04? I've tried many sites and none of them have worked thus far. \nWhen I plug my Wacom Bamboo Splash Pen (CTL-471), the tablet lights up and it responses to the pen, but nothing is working. No response from my computer when I move the pen over the active area. How can I get it to work?\nI'm using the Ubuntu Lucid Lynx 10.04 with the version 2.6.32-46-generic kernel.\nWhen I type in lsusb, it shows up as \" Bus 004 Device 006: ID 056a:00dd Wacom Co., Ltd \".\nUpdate (Apr 30, 2013)\nI tried lekensteyn's way:\n    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:lekensteyn/wacom-tablet\n    sudo apt-get update\n    sudo apt-get install wacom-dkms\n\nEverything worked until I entered  sudo apt-get update. The terminal starts spitting out lines until it reaches an error:\n    ... Hits and Igns ...\n    Err http://ppa.launchpad.net lucid/main Packages                               \n    404  Not Found\n    Err http://ppa.launchpad.net lucid/main Packages                               \n    404  Not Found\n    Hit http://packages.medibuntu.org lucid Release\n    Hit http://packages.medibuntu.org lucid/free Packages\n    Hit http://packages.medibuntu.org lucid/non-free Packages\n    W: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/irie/wacom/ubuntu/dists/lucid/main/binary-amd64/Packages.gz  \n    404  Not Found\n\n    W: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/lekensteyn/wacom-tablet/ubuntu/dists/lucid/main/binary-amd64/Packages.gz  \n    404  Not Found\n\n    E: Some index files failed to download, they have been ignored, or old ones used instead.\n\nThen I tried to go to Software Sources and add the APT line ppa:lekensteyn/wacom-tablet and nothing happened. The window for adding the APT closes and I'm left staring at the SOftware Sources window. I tried restarting and nothing changed.\nI'm at a lost now.\n\nA: This has to do with 10.04 LTS becoming an EOL release on May 9th, since the recent release of 13.04. Since the packages and everything were moved (/will be? I'm not exactly sure when this happens) to an archive, away from the normal server your terminal is trying to contact, the normal methods of updating/installing don't work.\nSo the only real suggestion we can give on this site (since we don't deal with EOLs) is: Upgrade to a supported version. The best method is to do a fresh install with a LiveUSB/CD, but upgrading should work as well.\nSee this article if you still really want to stay on 10.04 and install software.\n", "Q: Several questions about upgrading from 11.04 to 13.04 I still have the Ubuntu 11.04 and I want to upgrade it to Ubuntu 13.04, but:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have a directory called /soft where I have several softwares that I have installed manually. If I make the upgrade on the operating system is there a way to mantain that directory, or ubuntu will just delete it all?\n\n*And what about documents such as the /home/{myuser}/Documents, what will happen to them?\n\n*Will the installed softwares remain intact?\n\n*Is it advisable to upgrade the OS via terminal or is it better to format and install it all from scratch considering that there is a large gap between the OS versions?\n\nA: *\n\n*I have a directory called /soft where I have several softwares that I have installed manually. If I make the upgrade on the operating system is there a way to mantain that directory, or ubuntu will just delete it all?\n\n\n*\n\n*I have no idea. However, I like to believe that it will not delete it. The upgrade process upgrades packages and libs and all that, but not delete directories. I think they're clever enough to know that people create directories, even in the root directory. Also, don't forget that when upgrading through the Update Manager GUI, Ubuntu gives you a list of the packages and libs that will be upgraded, removed, and no longer needed, at which point you can choose to cancel the upgrade. I also found this: How does the Ubuntu upgrade process work? Look at the second, long answer. I haven't read it all, but it could contain some insight.\n\n\n*And what about documents such as the /home/{myuser}/Documents, what will happen to them?\n\n\n*\n\n*Everything in your /home folder should stay as it is. I upgraded from 12.10 to 13.04 a few days ago, and everything in the /home folder was intact.\n\n\n*Will the installed softwares remain intact?\n\n\n*\n\n*Well, it's yes and no, but more yes. The software will remain intact, but they might be broken and not work properly. For example, after my recent upgrade, VMware Workstation was not working. I had to dig through the answers and the Ubuntu forums to find out what exactly needed to be done, and I eventually got it to work. On the other hand though, other softwares work perfectly fine.\n\n\n*Is it advisable to upgrade the OS via terminal or is it better to format and install it all from scratch considering that there is a large gap between the OS versions?\n\n\n*\n\n*It is advisable to install all from scratch, not because of the \"large gap\", but because of software being rendered inoperable. If it's feasible for you to backup your data, install from scratch, bring back the data, and re-configure everything, then I guess a fresh install is better. But again, an upgrade is much less of a hassle =/.\n\n\n\nIn any case, always backup your data before an upgrade.\n\nA: You can surely upgrade via the terminal. It will keep all the things in /home directory intact. But it is always advisable to take backups. I don't have any any idea whether the /soft directory will be there after upgrade but you can always take a backup of it.\n\nA: If you do an upgrade, there are chances (am not sure) that the /soft folder is retained. But in case you install it from scratch, Ubuntu will overwrite on it. Either ways, a backup is suggested.\nThough logically you can upgrade from your version to 13.04, I would suggest a clean and fresh install. There are certain performance benefits some people have realized with a clean install vs an upgrade. Maybe when ubuntu settles down with a stable unity development, the upgrades would once again be at par with a clean install, but I would suggest the latter for now.\n", "Q: Ugly separators in toolbars - Ambiance - 13.04 Can I fix or change the separators' color for ambiance theme in toolbars? it's always white even if I change every value of \"separator\" in every config file of ambiance theme to be dark/black/not-white. Thanks.\nImage:\n\n\nA: The fix is modify some lines the css called 'gtk-widgets.css' located in folder /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0: \n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal with ctrl+alt+T and write sudo nautilus.\n\n*Search folder /usr/share/themes/Ambiance/gtk-3.0 \n\n*Modify this lines in css called 'gtk-widgets.css' (first, make a backup).\n\n\n*\n\n*Add -GtkWidget-wide-separators: true; in default sector.\n\n*Replace border-right-color: alpha (shade (*@bg_color*, 1.26), 0.6); for border-right-color: alpha (shade (*v*, 1.26), 0.6); in .separator class. \n\n*Delete \nborder: none; and color: @dark_bg_color; in .menuitem.separator class.\n\n\n*Save and reboot your computer. \n\n*Done!\n\n", "Q: Terminal command to open URL's in default and non-default browser I found this Ask Ubuntu question about how to open a URL in your default browser using the Terminal.

The Windows Start button is slightly taller so it peaks out from below and that visible bit is clickable. This did not occur in 12.04.\nIt seems like the Virtualbox seamless boundaries end too high up (perhaps they start at the top behind the Ubuntu top panel) and the boundaries are not in sync with the Windows guest, or else the Windows Start menu/taskbar would also just appear higher up and not chopped off at the bottom of the screen.\nI have tried enabling the 3D Acceleration Mode for the vm but that didn't help.\n\nEDIT:\n\n\n*\n\n*I am running the proprietary Nvidia graphics drivers (nvidia-310 310.44-0ubuntu2)\n\n*I have disabled the global menu\n\n*I am using sloppy mouse focus\n\n\nI will try to put this back to stock Ubuntu 13.04 and see if that fixes the problem.\nUPDATE:\n Restoring global menus did not fix the problem.\nUPDATE (2013-05-02):\n I was resizing the window of a program running in the Windows7 guest and when my mouse cursor hit the bottom of the screen, it seems the entire guest desktop pans down. But this left things less usable so I had to restart the guest vm. I suspect this has something to do with the interaction between Unity's top panel and Virtualbox since the effected parts are the height of the top panel.\n\nA: I had essentially the opposite problem, windows host and a Ubuntu 13.03 guest.  However the resolution to my problem may be what you need as well- perhaps setting the resolution this way on your Ubuntu host will solve the problem with your windows guest:\nScreen Resolution issue on Ubuntu 13.04 installed under Virtualbox\n", "Q: How do I configure Juju for use on Azure?

I have windows 7 installed in my C:\\ partition .Now I just installed Ubuntu 13.04 on my D:\\ partition ,but I don't know how to boot to Ubuntu.... ? Any help is much appreciated !\n\nA: If you installed grub onto your 'c:' drive (primary boot device), then hit shift when turning it on to bring up the menu. If you are using the windows 7 bootloader, hit f8 to bring up the windows boot menu.\n\nA: If you set two different partitions inside windows itself and assigned driver letters to both of them then they will act as two different drives, the best option for dual booting windows 7 and Ubuntu is to remove the ubuntu partition, reallocate it back to your windows 7 partition, reboot machine boot into the Ubuntu live cd and set the partitions in the installation software.\nIf you do it that way then you will be given the option automatically to choose between Windows 7 and Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Cannot change background color in Ubuntu 13.04 I cannot change my background to the color blue and when I try to my desktop background goes black.

For some reason I can not resize Chrome's window to less than 595 px on Ubuntu 12.10. I can resize Firefox's window to 0 px. Also I can resize the Chrome window to a very small size on Windows. This is an important issue when it comes to web design and more specifically responsive webdesign where resizing the window to at least 320px plays an important role.\nDoes anyone know why this is happening and how to fix it?\n\nA: This is not an Ubuntu dependant issue but a Chrome work environment one. There are some constraints on resizing the Chrome windows width to a minimum measure. \n- Disclaimer: all measures are empiric, approximate and manual -\nOmnibox seems to take a minimum width of 256px, plus the width taken by the back, forward, refresh and menu buttons restrict in my case the window to a minimum width of 390px. Also, every pinned tab you have increment the minimum width by a non-constant measure of pixels.

I am running Mac OSX Mountain Lion. I want to boot from my external Hard Drive into Ubuntu on a mac computer. My external Hard Drive is dual USB connected.\n\nA: Appropriately partition your external drive. Create a Ubuntu live CD/USB and boot from it. When it prompts you to choose your install method, click \"Something else.\"\nIt will take you to a menu to choose the disk you want to install on. Choose your external drive, and create one partition that is >= the amount of physical RAM you have installed in your Mac, and format it as Swap. Then, format the remaining as ext4. Set the ext4 mount point to /.\nSelect the ext4 partition, and click install. Ubuntu will install on the selected partition. Follow prompts to set up your user account, password, and basically general things.\nAfter Ubuntu is installed, it will prompt for reboot. Reboot, and as your Mac starts back up, hold the option/alt key and it will open up the boot menu.

Because we can do multiarch now installing 32-bit packages is possible, but it will lead to unnecessarily installing or removing package due to dependencies.\nA much better way to make sure the Virtual Box insallation meets our host architecture is adding the Oracle repository to our sources as depicted in the following question:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I install the VirtualBox version from Oracle to install an Extension Pack?\nNote that you will still install an Open Source version but you will get regularly updates of your Virtual Box with recent bugfixes. This version can be updated to a closed source PUEL version when needed.\nThe Virtual Box Open Source Edition from the software center usually is some versions behind, and can not be upgraded to a closed source (PUEL) version in case we need USB2.0 support.\n\nA: You need to follow the Debian-based Linux installation instructions on the download page:\nhttps://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads\nIf you just install the downloaded package, even if you get the right package, it will work until you reboot, then no Launcher. Following all the instructions allows the package manager to work its magic.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 - Shutdown hang at purple ubuntu loading screen Just updated from 12.10.

If you enable UEFI, your Ubuntu will not boot anymore.\n\nA: It is possible to enable EFI-mode booting, but you'll need to install an EFI-mode boot loader to get it to boot. There are numerous ways to do this, and which is best depends on certain details of your configuration, such as whether you're dual-booting with Windows. See my EFI Boot Loaders for Linux page for information on available boot loaders and installation methods generally. My rEFInd is likely to be easier to set up than most, but I can't make any promises without knowing more about your current configuration.\nInstalling an EFI-mode boot loader is unlikely to do damage by itself, unless you're dual-booting with Windows and accidentally damage the Windows boot loader. OTOH, the benefits will be slim. The biggest likely benefit is a reduction in a few seconds of your boot time, but even that's not certain.\n", "Q: How can I open these .docx files from Chrome more quickly? This is a very specific question. I'm a lawyer from Chile, the thing is we use a webpage to check on the state of our judiciary cases.\nThe problem when I started using Ubuntu (and Chromium) is that when I clicked a word document in the web-portal it didn't give me the option is viewing it in the browser. Moreover, it gave me the option of downloading it, but the extension of the file instead of being .docx was .do by default (and the file name is always DownloadFile.do). It took me a while to figure out that if I added the .docx to .do I could download and open the word document (which is a lot of trouble considering the number of files I need to check constantly and not save in my PC). PDF documents could downloaded correctly, but no opened in the browser.\n\nI thought that using Chrome instead of Chromium would fix the problem, but it only helped with the PDF files, not the .docx ones.\nIf you wish to try the website and check the problem, either go directly to this page or browse from http://civil.poderjudicial.cl/ by entering \"Rol Interno: C-18271-2011\" and \"Tribunal de Origen: 4° Juzgado Civil de San Miguel\" (at the bottom) and then clicking \"Consulta\". Don't worry, this information is public and I'm only using it as an example so you can help me with the .do files.\n\nA: The issue of \"opening\" files without having to save them first has been under discussion since 2009. There's currently no simple way to do it.\nThe closest you can get is to instruct Chrome to automatically open files of a certain type after saving them:\n\nAs long as you haven't configured Chrome to ask where to save each file, this should allow you to view the documents with one click.\nThere are still two annoyances with this approach:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your downloads folder will become cluttered.\n\n*A blank window will appear every time you download a file.\n\n\nYou can mitigate the latter by middle-clicking (or Ctrl+clicking) the links to open new tabs instead; Chrome will close the empty tabs automatically.\n\nA: .do is a web extension, not the file you are after downloading.  In this case the link you are clicking that ends in .do should be pushing the docx but your browser is being handed the .do file itself.\nYou can test this by opening the developer tools (menu, tools, developer tools) then click on the timeline tab.  When you click the link for your file you should get a delivery code of 200 (success) and the file name that was delivered. In this case it will be the .do file. \nShort version: The file being delivered is .do instead of .docx.  You can try renaming to .docx, but we have no way of knowing if that will do anything for you as we don't know what is actually being delivered.\n\nA: Download the file, rename it to add the extension of .docx, and then double click the file from \"nautilus\" the file browser to open it in libreoffice. As far as I know, the file would not open directly in browser.\n", "Q: \"General error mounting filesystems\" after upgrade to 13.04 I just tried updating to 13.04 from 12.10.

I am using Gnome 3.6 that ships with Ubuntu 13.04. Is this a feature (or lack of it) or a bug?\n\nA: This functionality is back in GNOME 3.8 now that Files is a Search Provider. It was taken out of GNOME 3.4 in order to make use of Providers instead, and only came back in 3.8. As Ubuntu 13.04 uses GNOME 3.6, you'll need to add the GNOME PPA to get 3.8 with recent files in the Shell Overview search. gnome archives\n\nA: In Gnome 3.2 this was a feature activated by default and it worked like a charm. Then, in Gnome 3.4 the developers disabled it claiming that it wasn't necessary, since the same functionality was supposedly provided by Gnome Documents. However, Gnome Documents sucks and cannot provide the same functionality. \nOf course, you can achieve the same result with a Gnome Shell extension named \"Search Recently Used Files\", which works OK but is inferior to Unity, since: \n(a) it shows only files and not folders and \n(b) it shows only files from the current session, which means that, if you use a file and reboot, this file will not be shown as a recent file.\nThere is also Synapse, which makes a great job of looking for recent files among other things.\nYou are absolutely right that it is unacceptable for a modern OS to not be able to provide a fast search in recent files. Actually, this was one of the reasons I am now abandoning Gnome Shell for Unity. Although I like the general concept, Gnome devs are completely unpredictable and may overnight let users hanging. Moreover, they have failed to create a consistent search functionality in the Gnome Shell Overview. I think the direction they have taken in Gnome 3.8 with all search results opening in Gnome Documents is not practical.\n", "Q: Why doesn't Brother HL 2130 printer work on Ubuntu 13.04?

The goal is to be able to use it on any computer with a USB 3.0 port. I have successfuly installed the ati 13.4 graphics driver on it - this is for my desktop which has a Radeon HD 7950 graphics card. I also would like to use this Ubuntu on my Mac, with Intel HD 4000 integrated graphics. Ubuntu works on my desktop with the ati drivers as it has the ati graphics card, however gave me a \"low graphics mode\" warning; I selected the option \"reset graphics\" and restarted. Ubuntu starts (the login screen is normal) but Unity no longer stats and so I have no windows border, no sidebar or top menu. I can right click and it show menus and I can open the terminal with the hotkey for it, but nothing else.\nKeep in mind: Ubuntu still works on the desktop with the ati graphics card, however it does not on my mac which had intel HD 4000 integrated graphics. Before it worked on both, but because of the lack of proprietary drivers, there was serious lag on the desktop.\nThank you for any help on how to get Unity to start on the mac!\n\nA: You have to fully uninstall the ATI drivers for Ubuntu to be able to start with full graphical support, since the ATI (and also the NVIDIA) packages links your openGL libraries to a propietary non-mesa implementation. And that's not compatible with the mesa-based intel driver.\nMy solution would be making an init script that detected the graphical card and installed/uninstalled the driver as needed during boot. It can delay the boot several seconds when you switch from one computer to another, though.\nPut these lines on the file /etc/init/lightdm.conf at the end of the file.

But I also noticed that I will need special precautions so my LAN does not get exposed.\nSo my question is:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to configure VirtualBox guest so it can not, by any means, access my PC (the host) files, or my LAN? From my previous question, I think I need to disable networking in guest. But then...\n\n*How can I (either at host or guest) sniff all connections he is trying to make? Hostnames, IPs, ports, content, etc? Installing Wireshark? Where, in host or guest? How?\n\n*Once I know the IPs/hostnames, how can I (again, at either guest or host) pretend to the malware that I am such hostname and reply its connections, communicating with it? Installing Apache and using cgi/php scripts etc? Where and how?\nI know this is a complex question, so to simplify: what really I need is the outline of a solution, a strategy that satisfy the goals. The list of tools, how they fit, and a general description of how it would work.\nSomething like, example: \"Set VirtualBox network to xxx mode, install wireshark on guest to sniff, edit /etc/yyyy so all conections are redirected to daemon zzz which will in turn invoke your scripts so you can reply to the malware\"\nUseful info:\n\n\n*\n\n*Host is Ubuntu 12.04\n\n*Malware is a java jar, so guest can be anything\n\n*Most connections are plain HTTP/HTTPS requests (but there may have more I'm unknown of)\n\n\nA: I think it would be easier to decompile the .class files that are zipped in the .jar, and inspect the source code. Or inspect the bytecode directly, with javap. This is not applicable if you need to inspect native libraries in the jar.\nTo answer your question: Set the VM's network mode to Internal Network, and have it share the internal network with another VM, that either has Squid and plays the role of a proxy, or has Apache/nc and pretends to be the remote machine.\nIf you want Internet access, have 2 network controllers on the proxy: one on the Internal Network, and the other one as Bridged or NAT. But you'll have that problem again, the networking mode will not distinguish your LAN from the rest of Internet.\nTo monitor connections, you can use netstat, possibly in combination with watch.\nTo sniff packets, you can use Wireshark on the proxy.\nTo fake connections at a low level, look into netcat (nc).\nTo fake HTTP connections, either set a static IP on the proxy, or change the infected VM's /etc/hosts to redirect connections to the proxy IP.\nEdit: To emulate connections and services, there is a tool called INetSim, available from the Ubuntu repositories starting with Bionic (https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=inetsim).\n", "Q: Compiling a DLL project written in c++ I am new to Linux, but I have tried Ubuntu for basic stuff and I really like it.

I'm trying to make my system resolve IPv4 addresses over an IPv6 connection because my IPv6 connection is more secure (yes, it really is. Long story). The IPv6 nameserver resolves IPv4 addresses; it works fine with \"dig\" command-line tool.\nHowever, NetworkManager GUI doesn't accept IPv6 addresses for IPv4 DNS. Some guides advise to edit /etc/resolv.conf, but on Ubuntu that file has a notice that the file will be overwritten and should not be edited.\nIs there any way to convince some part of NetworkManager that I really actually want it to use IPv6 DNS for IPv4? Or maybe there's some file other than /etc/resolv.conf? \nFor the record, I'm on Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise).\n\nA: It is true that in Ubuntu 12.04 and later you should not edit /etc/resolv.conf directly. Instead you enter nameserver information into the configuration file (or dialog box) for each utility that configures a network interface, whether it's ifup, NetworkManager, a VPN client, whatever.\nDespite its being a dynamically generated file, /etc/resolv.conf has the same syntax as it always did. See resolv.conf(5) for its syntax.\nSince you are using NetworkManager you should enter your DNS nameserver addresses in the \"DNS servers\" fields for the connection in question.\nOn the tab\nNetwork indicator | Edit Connections... | <connection> | Edit... | IPv6 Settings\n\nyou should be able to enter the IPv6 address of your DNS nameserver into the \"DNS servers\" field. This address should then show up in resolv.conf and thus get used as a nameserver address by the glibc resolver.\n", "Q: How to disable animations in Ubuntu 13.04 I updated to 13.04 few days ago.

But there's no problem in 12.10.\nI disabled the animation and face windows in ccsm, and window snapping feature in unity tweak tool but nothing changed.\nI doubt it is the fading animation about the ALT+TAB window. Just a guess.\n\nA: You can use the Unity-Tweak tool, or another route you can go is to use \"Ubuntu 2D\" when you log in. This is especially great for computers that are of an older age that cannot run 3D objects very well such as the Ubuntu Dash. Ubunru 2D will not have most of the animations, or at least it doesn't in 12.04 LTS Precise. Though if your not satisfied with the Unity Interface at all, such as me, you can install the gnome panel. To do this method\nOpen your Ubuntu Terminal: Ctrl+Alt+T\nType: sudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback\nand let it install.\nmind you that this is only for if your satisfaction is not there with the Unity interface. Like me the only reason I don't like unity is that it is too resource hungry. Even on 13.04 and 13.10 it still to resource hungry. They have fixed it a lot since 11.10, but it still requires a lot of work.\nWith the gnome-session-fallback installed my computer uses about 50% less Ram than Unity uses, going from over 500MB with the Unity Interface to around 250MB with the gnome-Panel (No Effects) applied.\nNow keep in mid that this is only for if you don't like unity. If you like it by all means ignore everything I just said and use the Unity tweak tool. It is a great tool for editing Unity settings to make it more suited for you and your computer speed. But also keep in mind, and this is from experience, if you don't know what you are doing; some of the settings in the Unity-Tweak tool can be very confusing (at least for me they were, I don't know about you) and it can mess it up quite badly, speaking from experience.\n\nA: There is tool called unity-tweak tool.

It has the option to store the password in the key ring, though.  I can start new apps using the starter bar, but I cannot use them move windows, or type into other windows.

The simplest way to do this is to look at the output of cat /proc/mdstat. It'll be called something like md126.

Easiest thing to do is boot from a Ubuntu live CD or USB and try and install alongside your other operating systems.  If it does not let you then you will have to delete one of your Windows operating systems to enable you to use Ubuntu, alternativly you could try installing Ubuntu on an external hard drive if your just wanting to experiment with it just be aware if you take this route you will encounter slower read/write speeds.\n\nA: Yes, you can install Ubuntu. The only thing you need is enough free space on your hard drive. If you don't have an empty space (non-partitioned), you'll need to resize one (or two) windows partitions. Ubuntu will detect Windows 7 & 8 during installation and it will put them, alongside Ubuntu on the boot menu. If you don't feel comfortable resizing partitions, you should ask someone else to do it for you. In case it isn't a problem for you to delete win7/8, you can let Ubuntu overwrite one of them.\n", "Q: Updating Quantal 12.10 to Raring 13.04 broke seahorse-nautilus After upgrading from Quantal to Raring the nautilus-seahorse plugin for GPG encryption cease to work.

I usually leave many programs running on my workstation and sometimes I need to use it remotely. So I need to connect to existing X session, while keeping physical display (workstation's monitor) locked all time. \nI tried vino (vino-server & vinagre as client), but they open new, empty X session, so it doesn't give me access to running applications.\nI also tried x11vnc but it looks to unlock physical screen and leave it unlocked (!) when client finish, so there we have security issue...\nOn both ends there is Ubuntu 12.04 running, with default GUI, so no GNOME specific solution will work (applets, etc.).\nIdeal solution should give me access to all programs running on both monitors and several \"virtual desktops\". Which can need capturing of special keys like Crtl+[number] and Alt-TAB.\nAlternatively... if it is possible to forward existing window (program already running) through ssh -X it will be a good workaround.\nEDIT: x1vnc, not \"x11server\" of course...\n\nA: You should take a look at x2go and just connect to \"Connection to Local Desktop\" instead of specifying a window manager or desktop environment.\nIt uses SSH, so once you install and start the server on your workstation, you should be able to connect to it with the x2goclient if you can already SSH into it.\n\nA: It is not possible to forward already existing windows through SSH as far as I know.\nI'd suggest going for x11vnc. You might need to install it first. This command should enable a one-time only passwordless VNC server sharing your current running desktop (first come, first served):\nx11vnc -noxdamage -display :0 -safer -nopw -once -xrandr\n\nYou might need to adjust the display. You can also get it programatically by using ConsoleKit dbus interface, but that's too much trouble and :0 is fine most of the time. If that doesn't work, just use :1 and so.\nThis comes in handy, because you can run it from a SSH sesion from elsewhere, just whrn you need it.\n\nA: You should take  a look on the X11RDP. \nIt's really a great update of the Xrdp in addition you can customize the behavior as u need.

The first screen after selecting DVD-boot, was a violet screen with a keyboard icon on the bottom. I tried to press some arrows and waited, then some random keys and waited, and so on and so forth... but this was simply unuseful: nothing happend. I decided to reboot and wait. Ubuntu started loading in some seconds and after a LONG wait, I was able to see the install menu. I thought it was a graphic-connected problem. In fact, I noticed that the copying and installing operations ended in a short time, in contrast with the EXTREMELY SLOW loading of the slides that present Ubuntu's features during installation.\nThe problem\nWhen I select Ubuntu from the grub menu, the log-in screen is loaded in short time. But when I confirm the log-in credentials, everything disappears and the screen shows the mouse pointer above the Ubuntu background (with \"Ubuntu 13.04\" on the lower left side of the screen). Moving the mouse causes the screen to blink (rapidly changing from black to the background) in an irregular manner.

I know that in Windows, Internet Explorer stores .flv temp files in temporary folder (C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Temporary Internet Files) when viewing YouTube. And the same make and Google Chrome in Windows (C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Cache). So it's easy to find a copy of that .flv file.\nHow about Chromium in Ubuntu? Does it store browsing temp data and where?\n\nA: I made a little research and now I can come with the answer that is not so simple as it seems at first sight.\nI searched a lot on Google, and almost everything is pointing to the ~/.cache/chromium/Default folder. It’s the folder where you should find google chrome’s cache files. But there are no big flash video files (like YouTube has), just small ones.\nIn the end, to answer the question, I came to these conclusions:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, you have to open an YouTube video and let it stream from internet.\n\n*In a Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T), you should get PID of Chromium that use Flash Player plugin.

Before I explain my issue, let me start by saying that I am relatively new with Ubuntu so please be patient with me !\nI had a Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 dual boot system, and everything was running smoothly.\nA week or so ago, I decided to install 13.04 alongside of W7 and 12.04, and since then, I think I am now using Grub from a different location. \nWhen I only had 12.04 (prior installing 13.04), I had used Grub Customizer to add some colour and change the background of my Grub boot menu.\nThe Grub2 menu that now I see when I boot does not have this customisation.\nHowever, when I do boot 12.04 and run Grub Customizer, I do see the colours/background that I used to see/have when I only had 12.04. \ns there any way to tell Ubuntu to use the Grub files that I had customized ?\n(Ubuntu 12.04 is on SD5, and 13.04 is on SD8)\nThank you very much in advance !!!\nDan\n\nA: When you installed 13.04, it reinstalled the Grub bootloader to the drive MBR and this is pointing at the 13.04 install, not the 12.04 install. You can still boot the 12.04 install, but it won't be the first one in the list.\nTherefore all your customizations in the 12.04 install are not taken into account. You can fix this by booting your 12.04 install, and reinstalling grub:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\n\nThis will put 12.04 back in charge of booting as it were (the Grub bootloader will be loading modules and the configuration from 12.04) and you'll see the 12.04 install at the top of the Grub menu again.\n", "Q: Recover lost deleted json files on ubuntu 12.04 server?

I have created instances, projects etc. I have made backups of database and openstack config files. I am trying test recovery by destroying and removing service keystone, just to see if it was recoverable. I also drop the keystone database. (it is backed up) So with juju i destroy the old keystone which was broken, and deploy a new keystone. This actually gets me running again except for the fact that all projects (tenants) are gone, and the instances does not belong to any project. So i restore the keystone database but without the tokens but when i do that i get an error in horizon telling me that keystone will not authorize the client.\nWhat would be the best way to restore a broken keystone node...? It seems when you redo keystone with juju you get new tokens. can juju somehow inject the old ones into the the new keystone?\n\nA: The problem you are hitting is that the keystone charm stores some information outside of the keystone database; specifically usernames and passwords for services are stored locally on disk so that when additional service units related to keystone, the keystone service can hand out the correct password for the requested user to the related service.\nYou will also hit issues if you have not provided admin-password and admin-token configuration when deploying keystone; the keystone service units will randomly generate these if not explicitly configured - so they will change when you remove and then add a new keystone service unit.\nWhat you end up with is a set of hashed passwords in the database (created by the first service unit) that don't match the generated passwords on disk in the second keystone service unit.\nIdeally we would fix this by some sort of generic object storage feature in juju (think object-put/object-get) but this is not a supported feature.\nAll of the on disk storage of passwords and tokens takes place in /var/lib/keystone; you might be able to pick these out as part of a backup of the keystone service unit itself; however you will hit races when you add the new service unit as the service relations will fire prior to you being able to restore these files.\nAs one of the OpenStack charm maintainers, I'll give this a bit more thought and see if we can come up with something more elegant.\n", "Q: Making Localhost as worldwide server I am using Ubuntu 12.04 with KDE desktop.\nI have installed apache2 on my pc.

To access your router its usually 192.168.1.254 unless you have edited the IP or have another form of setup, if you do your probably wont need this advice.\nYou will also need to use ufw to allow port 80 inbound and outbound from your PC. \nsudo ufw enable\nsudo ufw allow 80/tcp\n\nThose will allow access to you web server if you have your firewall up as you should.\nAlso suggest if your opening it up to the net to do some hardening of the web server before hand.

I have a Samsung i3 Ultrabook. It runs Windows 8. I used to run Ubuntu in Virtualbox. I hate it. I want to run Ubuntu as host. But Win 8 should be running in Virtualbox (for Office + Acrobat). But the notebook does not come with a Win 8 CD or serial number or anything. I fear that once I install Ubuntu as a host, I won't be able to get a running Win 8 again. Win 8 seems to be backed up on a recovery partition, but not on a physical drive.\nHow to set this up?\nNo, I don't want a dual boot, I want Ubuntu only. With Win 8 running in virtualbox.\nNo, there is no Win 8 DVD that comes with the ultrabook\n\nA: First, I'd like to know where the \"Windows 8 Installation Media\" is.  If its a separate DVD you are golden.  If it's on a \"Recovery Partition\" it's going to be harder.\nThe problem is that Windows 8 installs to the Hardware.  It ONLY has drivers for the exact hardware it's on.  If you were to try to migrate the partition into a Virtual Disk Image, it would not boot, as the hardware is different. \nUbuntu 13.04 will run perfectly on the Samsung Ultrabook, and Windows 8 runs fine inside of VirtualBox.  It's getting Windows 8 into the VDI that poses the problem.\nBTW... I hope it's more than just Office and Acrobat that you need Windows for, because these both run very well under Ubuntu 13.04 (PlayonLinux install of WINE).\n\nA: @Karen: Martin has asked for Windows 8. The link you have provided is for Windows 7. This makes a lot of difference since Windows 8 runs on UEFI with Secure Boot (and not with a BIOS)\n@Martin: I am trying the same thing as you...\nMy experience so far with Virtual Box 4.2.10:\n\n\n*\n\n*Secure Boot: \nYour host system (ubuntu) needs to run with Secure Boot \"disabled\". VirtualBox acts as a kernel module. Secure boot allows only kernel modules that have been \"certified\" with the Secure Boot key. VirtualBox is not certified and therefore will not run with Secure Boot \"enabled\".\n\n*Windows  8 OEM Installation Medium:\nI have on my HP Envy 23 with preinstalled Windows 8 OEM and on my HP Envy 4 with preinstalled Windows 8 OEM an option to start \"HP Tools\" and then be able to generate a installation media (be careful: You can only generate only one such a media). Unfortunately I have chosen to generate an USB-stick. VirtualBox does not support boot from USB yet. Therefore make sure to generate a DVD.\n\n*Windows 8 OEM License:\nAs I read the OEM license you are allowed to run one single Windows 8 on the hardware. It does not matter if this is as host or as guest. So this should be fine for you. However as Windows 8 checks the hardware you need to be sure not to change the parameters of you virtual hardware. Otherwise you will probably have to phone Microsoft again to get a new key.\nI am very interested if you succeed. Please let me know. Good luck!\nI have also tried with VMWare Player 5.0.2 . But I also did not succeed\n\nA: I researched this for ages. My solution came from here. http://blog.c22.cc/2013/05/19/quickpost-windows-8-digital-product-key-recovery/\n\nA: Stop worrying, all concerns already solved by others to accomplish exactly as you hope:\nhttps://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=31759&start=30\nThe big considerations are exporting and testing your Samsung's SLIC bin, someone else incorrectly asserted Windows 8 only includes drivers for the included hardware and it is the opposite since Windows installation media grows because of all the legacy hardware support that is one of the few reasons Windows is attractive for wide range of hardware support.\nWindows virtual driver support isn't an issue whether ancient versions of vMWare or cranky Hyper-v, the devices are always more generic and never a problem for Windows Plug n' Play / hardware AutoDetect.\nYou can extract your existing Windows Serial Number with lots of things like Nirsoft Produkey that is a single file executable, no installation and free at Nirsoft.net. You'll probably need it at first run of virtualized 8 that will scream about new hardware and demand a re-entry but not an issue.\nRegarding your concern about resorting to old 8 once Ubuntu is installed,  you already know that imaging is the better way to freeze dry your currently running Win8, but advanced format drives makes is harder if still using a Binary Research copy of Ghost 2 from the floppy,  Macrium Reflect free edition seems capable of working with most AF drives even when Paragon or Acronis chokes, try it to verify it images your entire HDD.\n\nA: My wife won't let me drop Win 8 on our machine, so I've been running Ubuntu in VMWare. It works ok, but would run better on a fresh install.. I don't use much more than a browser and some light media, so it's ok for now, until I can afford a laptop of my own to wipe and use Linux only. I want a dual boot of Ubuntu and Mint, and I'll be a happy camper.. Now, I have Ubuntu, Mint, OpenSuse, and Linux Royal all on VM's.. \nBut like mentioned above, to do what you want, you first need to create your recovery media. I recommend Belarc Advisor to get your product key. It'll find any and all product keys and even registration #'s on your internal components..

However, it seems that critical files / directories are now missing and the server will not boot. \nI have backed up my critical files to a thumb drive and now want to repair the system. I am hoping that there is a method where I can use the installer to install linux again but not overwrite all that goodness I created? The home directories and data stores for the myth videos are on separate partitions and were not corrupted. If I go into the custom settings of the install and ask it not to format the drive, will this work for me? Thank you.\n\nA: For those who come here with a similar question, all I was able to do was backup files and reinstall. \nFortunately, I had originally separated my home directories in a partition instead of leaving them in the system partition. This way, when I reinstalled, I used the same username and password and my user was back in business.\nSo if you have not already moved your home directories to it's own partition, do it now!

They are all in a good physical state and work perfectly well, so I have no reason to stop using them  When I first attempted to update to 12.04 the installation failed, reporting that the processor did not support pae. This led me to ask the original version of this question. This did not solve my problem, the question was marked as 'asked before' and not answered. None of the 'asked before' answers solved my problem so I was left with laptops I could not update.\nAs I can't actually add my own answer to this question due to it being labelled as 'asked before' (even though this variation of the pae question had not been asked), so I will answer it by editing the question.\nI did some research on the Pentium M and discovered that it DOES in fact support pae despite the installation not finding it. The solution to my problem was to use the 'forcepae' boot option. From 14.04 onwards I believe this problem has been fixed in the installation.\n\nA: I don't know whether your issue is due to an old kernel, or just the Intel drivers, but my laptop (HP Compaq NC6000 with a Pentium M and a Radeon 9600) does well with Ubuntu 12.10 and the non-pae drivers from webtoms bazaar page.

It has some plugins for krunner but now I want to remove some of them (not all of them so I cant simply remove the package). And also I'm not going to disable them but I want to remove them.\nHow can I remove a special plugin from krunner???\n(sorry for my bad english)\nregards, mostafa\n\nA: Each plugin has a .desktop file in /usr/share/kde/services.  If you delete the .desktop file, then the plugin will no longer show up in krunner.\nAdditionally, the functionality of a plugin is provided by a library (.so) file in /usr/lib/kde4/, so you could also remove that.  You should know, however, that one library may provide functionality to more than one plugin.\nFor example, if you want to get rid of the YouTube plugin you could delete\n\n\n*\n\n*/usr/share/kde4/services/plasma-runner-youtube.desktop\n\n\nAnd since no other plugin uses the library krunner_youtube, you could also delete\n\n\n*\n\n*/usr/lib/kde4/krunner_youtube.so\n\n\nIt's probably safer and easier to just leave it in place, though.\nTo reinstall a removed service, just reinstall the plasma-runners-addons package.\nHaving said all this, I think the preferred method of not having plugins is just to disable them.\n", "Q: \"Failed to setuid to root.\" How do I Establish a VPN network? My university decided that the old VPN-network, which worked fine, wasn't good enough anymore and abandoned it. Now I have to establish a completely new VPN-network. My university provided me with a manual (in dutch) which I followed, but it doesn't work. Almost everything could be the problem but where I'm really stuck is at the part where terminal says: \nopen(/home/simon/.juniper_networks/network_connect/ncsvc.log) failed: Permission denied\nncsvc> Failed to setuid to root.

Is there someone out there who knows how to solve this error? And can explain it to me in the easiest possible way?\nI use Ubuntu 12.04, 32-bit.\nI do hope that this is the right place to ask this question,\nThanks in advance, Simon\n\nA: It's mostly a problem of your HOME-directory. It's encrypted, am I right? ;)\nSo it is mounted with a \"nosetuid\" option, that prevents any SUID Operations to work as you expect them.\nSolution: copy your network-connect directory somewhere else on your HDD i.e. /opt/juniperconnect, edit the junipernc-script to point to the new directory (called _jpath in the script /usr/local/bin/junipernc ), and then it works for me. I'm still using nc version 7.1 with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\n\nA: If your home directory is encrypted, then this is a duplicate of Error when running binary with root setuid under encrypted home directory.  If it's not (or your entire drive is encrypted, which is different), then you can fix this like this:\n$ ll ~/.juniper_networks/network_connect/ncsvc\n-rwx--x--x 1 mvorburger mvorburger 1274492 Feb 14 14:14 ncsvc\n$ sudo chown root:root ~/.juniper_networks/network_connect/ncsvc\n$ sudo chmod 6711 ~/.juniper_networks/network_connect/ncsvc\n$ ll ~/.juniper_networks/network_connect/ncsvc\n-rws--s--x 1 root root 1274492 Feb 14 14:14 ncsvc\n\n\nA: Are you talking about the UvA VPN? This took me a long time to solve as well. Here are some questions to see how far your installation has progressed: \nHave you downloaded the certificate into the /user/local/nc folder? \nHave you installed Java? \nAnd, don't forget to change your directory to the /user/local/nc folder before executing the command as well. \nFor me, the command I have put into a little script runs as follows:\ncd /usr/local/nc\nsudo ./ncsvc -h uvavpn.uva.nl -u  -r users -f uvavpn.uva.nl.der\n(don't forget to replace  with your username).\nLet me know if this helps you along, if not, I can check what's wrong from there. \n", "Q: Computer Desktop icon for 13.04 I know that ubuntu 13.04 doesn't have a \"Computer\" icon for Desktop anymore,isn't there a way to make a shortcut for it tough?

I have a whole set of web sites on my Ubuntu computer that I use for testing and development. I don't host them on the internet, I just access them locally for design and debugging.\nEach one is built on PHP, each one uses a MySQL database. There are about twelve of them.\nI want to transfer them to a new Ubuntu install. I've done this before, and when I have, I created each config file in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled, I load in each MySQL database, I create a user for each database... It's tedious and prone to (my) human error.\nI already have all sites and all configurations set up on one computer. Is there not a way I can wholesale pick up all the databases, files, Apache settings, configurations, and everything and move it to the new server all in one go?\n\nA: Thanks to tips both from Askubuntu and from the Linux & Unix SE, I compiled what seems to be the most efficient way of doing what I set out to do. I hope this is helpful to others, and if anyone can see any places where this process can be streamlined and improved, please contribute.\nNote before proceeding that I use phpMyAdmin, so that's where I did all my MySQL operations. Also, this is assuming the target computer is a fresh install and that no settings or files on the new computer need saving. These operations will overwrite what's on the target computer. Lastly, this is what I did to transfer my system, so your specific situation will likely differ. This is just offered in hopes of giving people in similar situations a page less blank to start with. I transfered from Ubuntu 13.04 to Linux Mint 14.\nOn the old computer:\nMake a directory where you can store everything you're going to transfer over. \nCopy the directory where you keep all your HTML, CSS, and whatever other files that make up your website. I keep mine in directory in my /home folder, and then link to that from /var/www with a symlinked directory called Websites.\nCopy all the entire /etc/apache2 directory directory.\nCopy the file /etc/hosts.\nUsing phpMyAdmin, export to an sql file all the databases that you have created and want to move to the new server. In phpMyAdmin, under the export tab in the home area, you need to use the custom option to select which databases to export. Make sure to not copy the databases called mysql, performance_schema, and information_schema. You shouldn't need them, and you can't overwrite them on the new server anyway. So if you include them, it will just cause headaches when installing on the new computer.\nGo into the mysql database and copy the table user into an sql file.\nOn the new computer:\nInstall phpMyAdmin in Synaptic. This installs all the necessary files for a LAMP server by pulling in all the relevant dependencies. You may need some additional components. In my case, I also needed javascript-common, and xdebug.\nFrom the directory where you have stored all the files from the old computer, as described above, run the following command to move your apache2 directory into your /etc/folder.\nsudo cp -R apache2 /etc\n\nOpen your old hosts file, and copy the first line only, everything after where it says 127.0.01. Make sure not to copy the line that begins with 127.0.1.1. Open /etc/hosts on the new computer and paste over the first line. Again, be careful to only copy what comes after 127.0.0.1. Leave the rest of the file alone. You will need root privileges to edit and save the /etc/hosts file.\nCopy your HTML files and web site data to wherever you usually do. In my case, I keep them in the /home directory. Create a symlink to that directory in /var/www, and if you do, make sure that you have FollowSymLinks set as an option in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default and /etc/apache2/sites-available/default (usually they are the same file, linked to each other). Also, you need to make sure that the privileges for the folders being symlinked in your /home are accessible to the web server in terms of having the right privileges. That's kind of a big topic, and I've noticed people disagree about what makes sense. There are (at least) two users involved, the user account you log into your system with, and www-data, which administrates web server stuff. You could change which user you access your server with, you could include your login user into the right groups to access the web server... maybe... that part is unclear to me. However, for me, running chmod +x on the directory that contains the folder that contains all the HTML files did the trick. Just to be clear, you have to run that one level up from the folder that contains the HTML files. In my case, my HTML files and directories and sites are all in /home/dave/Dropbox/Websites. So I ran chmod +x /home/dave/Dropbox/, and then chmod +x -R /home/dave/Dropbox/Websites. Like I said, this part is fuzzy to me, as privileges always baffle me, but this is what worked.\nIn my case, I stored some of my Apache log files in a custom folder, called Apache_Logs in my /home directory. Recreate that file, and if you have any other custom features, you need to do the same.\nRestart Apache with this command:\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\nNow that Apache is done, onto restoring the databases.\nThe sql file you created with all your databases in it might be large, many megabytes in size. When uploading an sql file in phpMyAdmin, it defaults to only allowing uploads up to a maximum of 2MB. To change this, open /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini, find where it says upload_max_filesize and change that to be big enough to upload your sql file. This requires root privilege, and change it back after you finish this whole thing, if you think it matters. If you do this, you will have to restart Apache again for the new setting to take effect.\nIn phpMyAdmin, under the Import tab, import all your databases by uploading your sql file.\nStill in phpMyAdmin, go to the mysql database, select the user table, and drop it. Then go to the Import tab, and upload the user table sql file you saved from your old computer. At this point, you'll have all the users you had from the old machine, and all your databases, but the users and databases aren't connected, so this next part still has to be done one by one. :(\nIn the home area of phpMyAdmin, go into the Privileges tab where you'll find a list of all the users. Go through each of your created users, and with each one, select Edit Privileges, then in the screen that pops up, go to Database-specific privileges, select the correct database, and in the next screen you can select for that user to have the right privileges on the database you want them to control. In my case, each user has complete control over the database they administer, so I used the check-all function and saved.\nYou need to restart MySQL at this point, so the changes in the user privileges will take hold.\nsudo service mysql restart\n\nAt this point you should be good to go. Open a browser and go to your web sites like you used to do on your old machine, and away you go!\nI hope that is helpful for some others.\n\nA: This is a pretty simple task for which you need 4 things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dump of all MySQL databases (use mysqldump for this) and\n\n*List of installed packages for apache2 and the modules that you use (dpkg -l and grep are your friends) and \n\n*Files in /etc/apache2/sites-available (since that's where the actual virtualhost configuration files should be - those in sites-enabled should only be symlinks usually created with a2ensite\n\n*Other files under /etc/apache2 that you've made modifications to.\n\n\nIf you do this by hand each time you want to move them then yes, it is tedious, which is one of the reasons you should aim to automate it by writing a simple shell script that takes care of all this for you.\n", "Q: Chrome automatically starts on boot while using xfce As I said in title, when I boot my PC and after system loads, Chrome starts automatically.

My brightness hotkeys are not able increase or decrease the brightness of the screen. And as a matter of fact, I also can not reduce the brightness from the Brightness & Lock menu under System Settings. Any solutions?\nEDIT: I think I may have found the reason behind the problem. In the previous versions of Ubuntu there were acpi_video0 and intel_backlight inside the /sys/class/backlight folder. Now in 13.04 there are dell_backlight and intel_backlight in that folder. And the most interesting part, my friend installed 13.04 on his Dell Vostro and in his system's /sys/class/backlight folder there are acpi_video0 and intel_backlight. So the brightness hotkeys are working for him.\n\nA: I have the same model and I had the same problem all the way through 13.04 development until one day before release and then it started working. I filed the bug here: Bug #1105604: Brightness control stopped working\nWhat you can do is to use a manual override that I used throughout development, by modifying /etc/rc.local as follows:\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n#\n# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n# Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n# value on error.\n#\n# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n# bits.\n#\n# By default this script does nothing.\necho 978 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\nchmod 777 /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\nexit 0\n\nThe downside is that you can't change the brightness easily except by manually modifying the file /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\nWhen I did have it working, I used the Fn + brightness keys to check the settings: the lowest setting is 490 and after that it goes up in increments of 488. So these are the default settings for /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness:\n490 Lowest with backlight on\n978\n1466\n1954\n2442\n2930\n3418\n3906\n4394\n4882 Brightest\n\nMy brightness controls were previously working, but are broken again so I decided to create a script to manage it:\n#!/bin/bash\n# Dell N4010 brightness control workaround\n# Note: add the following to /etc/rc.local\n#       chmod 777 /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n# For convenience I've assigned the keys Alt-Up and Alt-Down to run this script\n# Fine tune the bump parameter as required\n#\n# Usage:\n#    ./brightchg.sh up   # bump up brightness\n#    ./brightchg.sh down # bump down brightness\n#\ncurr=`cat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness`\nbump=244\nif [ \"$1\" == \"up\" ]; then\n  curr=`echo \"$curr + $bump\" | bc`\nelse\n  curr=`echo \"$curr - $bump\" | bc`\nfi\n# Set the brightness to the new level making sure it's always above 30 (minimum usable)\nif [ $curr -gt 30 ]; then\n    echo $curr | tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\nfi\n\nNote: I added a line in /etc/rc/local to give me authority to the brightness file:\nchmod 777 /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n\nThen I assigned it to the keys Alt+Up and Alt+Down as shown here:\n\n\nA: Ok, so here's the solution I found. This command is the only way in which I can change my Laptop brightness. \necho X |sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\nWhere \"X\" is any number between 1 and your laptop max_brightness capacity. Here's How you can find that number:\ncat /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/max_brightness\n\nIn my case, is a range bettween 1 and 7. So I just created an alias for every level of brightness. In a way that \necho 3 |sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\nIs now:\nzbright3\n\nNote: I added the 'z' so I can just write 'zb' and then press tab, to make things faster.\nAnyway, Is probably not the most effective solution, but It sure works well for me. If you're not afraid of the terminal, it should work just fine for you as well.\ntry this as well\nRun:\nsudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nUpdate these lines:\n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n  GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\"\n\nwith the following arguments:\n\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_backlight=vendor\"\n  GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"acpi_osi=Linux\"\n\nThen run sudo update-grub and reboot.\n\nA: I've had the same problem. The brightness slider didn't work, nor did the hotkeys. So I wrote a small panel indicator which could adjust brightness.\nBut you will have to add write permissions to the /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness file. Here are the steps if you are interested.\nDownload the app indicator source from here: indicator-brightness\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure that the brightness can be adjusted using intel_backlight by using the following method\n\n*\n\n*echo 1000 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness and enter password\n\n*If your brightness changes, continue to step 2.\n\n\n*Change permissions for the /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness file by\n\n*\n\n*Open the /etc/rc.local file sudo gedit /etc/rc.local\n\n*Add the chmod command above exit 0 : chmod 777 /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness\n\n\n*Move the indicate-brightness.py to /usr/bin mv indicate-brightness.py /usr/bin/\n\n*Make the file executable. sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/indicate-brightness.py\n\n*Add the command indicate-brightness.py to Startup Applications\n\n\nYou don't really have to move it to /usr/bin but I found it easy to access the file from there.\nNote: I borrowed the brightness step values from bcbc's answer above.\nI have also posted some screenshots in my blog if you want to see how it looks : blog\n\nA: Solution given at following link worked for me:\nBrightness keys F4 and F5 not working on Dell XPS 15.6 Laptop\nMy Configuration is as follows:\nOS: openSuse 12.3 (Dartmouth)\nDesktop: KDE 4.10\nLaptop: Dell Inspiron 15\nNote: Although solution proposed to run command 'update-grub' but I couldn't run as it was not found on the system. Fortunately, even without running this and rebooting the system fixed these keys. Now, I am able to adjust the brightness using F4 and F5 Keys in functional mode.

I know this is probably a question this is asked over and over again but I'm not finding anything close to an answer that I need.  I am installing Ubuntu 13.04 on my Lenovo x130e netbook .  It has been a long time since I have used Ubuntu (Hardy Heron) so I'm not exactly sure on how to go about this.  Here's my system specs:\nCPU: AMD e450 apu dual 1.65Ghz\nRAM: 8Gb DDR3 Corsair Vengence 1066mhz\nSSD: Crucial M4 128Gb SSD\nVid: Radeon HD6320 384Mb\nNow here's my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Since I am running a single SSD and have plenty of RAM, should I use a swap file?  If so how large of a swap?\n\n*I am going to use .ext4 filesystem but is there any specific way I should partition my drive?  (1 partition for /home, another for boot, etc...)\n\n*I am planning to upgrade to 13.10 when it releases, is there anything I should keep in mind until then?\nI have never really used a forum before so I figured that this would be the best time to start.  I have decided that I am tired of having to deal with Microsoft and want to break free of their bloated software.  I have read through your forums many times before and found that this is probably the best place to begin the process of reacquainting myself with Ubuntu.  Thanks for your time! \n\nA: I think your idea to partition the SSD into a smaller root and larger home and use the HDD for large data files (movies, backups) is perfect. At least that is exactly my setup.\nClearly, /root has to be on the SSD (because this is where the SSD will be most advantageous), and clearly, the root partition does not need much space. Actually, 20 Gb is still an overkill -- I have 15Gb and still over 3Gb free with tons of software installed.\nAlso, if you plan for a swap partition, put in on the SSD.\n/home makes perfect sense on the SSD, as there are tons of user-specific configuration files that need to be accessed quickly.\nFinally, if you run any kind of databases you might consider creating a database partition on the SSD. SSD are not much faster than HDD when it comes to data transfer rates, but they beat HDD by order of magnitude in terms of access time -- and this is often the limiting factor in databases.\nAs for the mount point: you can make your HDD mount for example to /data, and then create symbolic links in your /home that point to a particular directories on the /data:\nln -s /data/Videos ~/Videos/\n\nA: If you are using a HDD and a SSD, I made a video tutorial for it\nsince that looks like a laptop APU, i assume you are using a laptop so you probably only have 1 disk drive you could use one of these to replace the dvd drive like I did\nif you dont really need 128gb of storage i suggest leaving the extra space at the end of the drive unallocated so you will have more over provisioning, which makes write speeds higher and makes the drive last longer (at least for sandforce based SSDs), since it is your only drive you should probably run trim via cron for better performance\nHere is a good guide to follow\n\nA: Since these answers are mostly simplistic, I will give some tips. I know this question is a couple years old but these are not good answers. \n1) For a simple home system, just use the Ubuntu defaults. They should be good. \n2) Depending your drive, you may want to put frequently written to partitions (swap, /var/log /tmp) on a HDD to extend your SSD but that will cost you performance if you do that. With a laptop though that is usually not an option. \n3) The rule of thumb is that you make swap of at least the size of you RAM. If you are not using all your ram, you should be able to configure Linux to only use swap if run out of memory to avoid locking the system or when suspending to disk (sleep, etc).\n4) Modern Reasons for partitioning:\n\n\n*\n\n*You are dual booting\n\n*You need swap (some systems with ample ram can actually live without swap)\n\n*You don't want tmp files, logs or user files fill up you whole disk so  some people use separate mount points for /tmp, /var or /var/logs, /home, /opt, /usr/local, etc. Sometimes you may want to lock down / so that the previous mount points along with /root are separated out so you can remount / as read-only. Then you just need to remount / (as root with sudo) when updating or making system changes.\n\n*Often I will use separate partition(s) for /home and/or some custom data directories so that they can be shared by different OSes and to make it easier to switch distributions or upgrade as well.\nThis should be a good start.. \n\nA: DON'T use a swap partition or file. Because of regular writes to swap, your SSD will wear faster.\nMake one big partition for / (format it to ext4,) so no separate partitions for /home/ or /boot/, because there is no need for and it will only make things more complicated.\nAfter installation, edit /etc/fstab, and change the only line (because you don't have other drives) to:\nUUID=x-x-x-x-x /               ext4    errors=remount-ro,noatime,discard 0       1\n(I own a m4 128 GB drive myself, with one partition \"/\" of 80 GB for Ubuntu.)\n\nA: I would only make 1 partition. / that it. Reason being, say you make a /home and a 15+ GB / partition, but only use 7-8GB of that, you have 7-8GB just sitting there. There is no benefit to having or not having multiple partitions. \nConcerning swap, if you're not doing any RAM intensive stuff, i.e. building Android, 4GB RAM is plenty, no need for swap. If you are doing RAM intensive stuff, with only 4GB RAM I would suggest at least 2GB swap. As was said in previous posts, swap on SSD will degrade the drive at a faster rate, although that amount is negligible. Most respectable \"experts\" say that a SSD should outlive your machine.\n\nA: Don't create different partitions for /home /var /tmp - just put everything on the SSD.\nThe difference in performance is amazing.\nAt first I followed these partitioning advices and set up my system this way. Now I decided to move everything on the SSD and got something like 5 times faster system. \n", "Q: Installing the linux-virtual package from a preseed file I'm attempting to automate a server installation of Precise on a virtualbox VM. Eventually I'll use some of the preseed configuration to install it on a few ESXi VMS.\nI would like to use the linux-virtual kernel package and the documentation suggests that it is possible to change the kernel selection.\nI currently have these lines in my preseed file\nd-i base-installer/kernel/image string linux-virtual\nd-i base-installer/kernel/altmeta string linux-virtual\n\nI've also tried various other strings including linux-image-virtual.\nAlthough linux-virtual is not on the server install CD, it is in the archive and I have the preseed file set up our local apt-cacher-ng instance:\nd-i apt-setup/local0/repository string http://core:3142/gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise-updates main\nd-i apt-setup/local1/repository string http://core:3142/gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise main\nd-i apt-setup/local2/repository string http://core:3142/gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu   precise-security main\n\nHowever during the installation I just get a selection menu which allows me to choose from various flavours of the generic kernel.\nI'd like to install linux-virtual within the preseed so I can avoid the need to reboot again, as I would have to if I installed it after the installer had run.\n\nA: It turns out that the answer is that installing the linux-virtual package on 12.04.2 is pointless.\n12.04.2 ships with a backported kernel from Quantal, the package is called linux-image-lts-quantal. In Quantal, the -virtual kernel package has been abolished, so there's no equivalent -virtual package.\nIt is possible to install the linux-virtual package after installation, but this will involve a downgrade from 3.5.0 to 3.2.0.\n\nA: You don't want the leading linux-, that is implied.  I also don't think you need \"base-installer/kernel/image\", try leaving that as default.\nRef:\nbase-installer/kernel/altmeta\nDescription: for internal use; can be preseeded\n Optional postfix for kernel meta packages; can be used for example to\n support installation of an updated kernel for stable.\n Don't include the leading hyphen: it will be prepended in the code.\n", "Q: I have a special line in my Grub of Ubuntu 11.10 -- Will it survive to 12 if I \"do-version-upgrade?\" A problem with computers with Intel Sandy Bridge and Intel Celeron causes them to display only a black screen and a mouse cursor if RC6 is enabled (which it has been for all versions after 11.10). In order to get Ubuntu working on this computer (an Intel \"Next Unit of Computing\" or \"NUC\" model 847) I had to install Ubuntu 11.10, which is running fine now. After I did that, I modified Grub to change it from:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\" \nto \nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash i915.i915_enable_rc6=0\".\n\nI need that i915.i915_enable_rc6=0 bit to survive the version upgrade or I can't upgrade. Will it survive?\n\nA: I would assume that line will not survive and be prepared to again edit grub and or debug your intel card with the upgrade.\nYou may want to test a live CD before upgrading to see how your card performs.\n\nA: During the upgrade, if there is a new /etc/default/grub in the package, you will be prompted on what to do.  You can either keep your version, take the new packaged version, or see the difference between the two.  If you choose to keep your version then your settings will be preserved.  You can of course, just take the new packaged version and then edit it after to put your argument back in ( and then run update-grub ).\n", "Q: Juju and MAAS: ERROR No matching node is available I had created an environment w/ juju + MAAS, then destroyed it due to some misconfiguration.

I did try to WINE e-sword. That did not work, so I am back at Windows 7 and e-sword will not open there.\n\nA: The proper method of running a Windows program in Ubuntu begins with installing Wine and then installing that Windows program under Wine.\nIf you try and execute a program stored in the Windows disk/partition of your computer from Ubuntu, it might work for some portable/standalone programs but most Windows programs might not even start.\nIt's difficult to know how such a program behaves under these circumstances, but in most cases it shouldn't make any changes in the Windows disk/partition of your computer other than making some changes in your Ubuntu directory /home/$USER/.wine.\nSo it might merely be a coincidence that e-sword failed to work after you tried to run it from Ubuntu, although other possibilities cannot be ruled out completely.\n", "Q: How to recover after Ubuntu freeze on boot after installing broadcom STA driver I have installed ubuntu 12.04 on bootcamp of my early 2011 macbook pro using the ubuntu windows installer.

Long time ago now.\nAnyway, I was wondering whether it was possible to change this picture... I don't really like it.\n\nA: Take a JPEG image of your choice. Move/copy it to Your Home folder. Rename it to \".face\". Yes, a dot-file without extension. Log out, and You should see it!\nIt should be JPEG and also a square. PNG will not be shown (it works for User Manager, but not for LightDM login, unfortunately). Image of irregular dimensions will get streched.\nThis works for me on Xubuntu 13.04. Good luck! \n\nA: Try System Settings - User Accounts. Click on the grey head (or the thumbnail ) that's shown above 'Account Type'. There you can change it. \nBut...a default Ubuntu 13.04 installation will not show a picture of you in the lightdm login screen.\nThere's information on Help Ubuntu and on this ArchWiki page on how to customize lightdm.\nYou need to edit the \n/etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf\n\nThis is how a fresh installed lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf file looks like:\n#\n# background = Background file to use, either an image path or a color (e.g.     #772953)\n# theme-name = GTK+ theme to use\n# font-name = Font to use\n# xft-antialias = Whether to antialias Xft fonts (true or false)\n# xft-dpi = Resolution for Xft in dots per inch (e.g. 96)\n# xft-hintstyle = What degree of hinting to use (hintnone, hintslight, hintmedium, or hintfull)\n# xft-rgba = Type of subpixel antialiasing (none, rgb, bgr, vrgb or vbgr)\n# show-language-selector (true or false)\n#\n[greeter]\nbackground=/usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png\ntheme-name=Ambiance\nfont-name=Ubuntu 11\nxft-antialias=true\nxft-dpi=96\nxft-hintstyle=slight\nxft-rgba=rgb\nshow-language-selector=true\n\nfile.\n", "Q: Can the bootloader be stored outside the HDD? If the Ubuntu boot loader is stored on the Hard Drive, is there an alternative to loading the boot loader from the hard drive? \nCan it be stored on alternate storage such as a CD or even an external hard drive and used to boot the user's system?  \n\nA: Yes, you can.\nYou just need to choose where to install the bootloader in the installation process. Watch out for where is mounted your media (eg. /dev/sdc1) and mark it by choosing 'advanced' options just before you confirm, when the screen shows you the resume of the information, where the new system will be, and stuff. Something like those images in this link in portuguese.\nOr, if you have a system running already, change the location and reinstall it. There's a lot of information about how to do this.\nMy sister have a laptop running windows, and sometimes I took it borrowed to do something.

In the installation settings I done what I have explained: with a usb plugged, choose its location for bootloader install and done.\nSo I changed the boot options in pc setup, saying for computer try to boot first by usb, then the HDD.\nWhen my usb is plugged, the bootloader works and starts ubuntu, when not plugged, windows starts and even know nothing about linux existence.\n(:\nHope it helps, sorry with any bad english.\n", "Q: Can I sync a folder once a day rather than immediately I want to use it to do a nightly \"backup\" of files from a computer where the files will change several times a day but only want to backup once a night.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: I prefer to use rsync, and to schedule it as a cron job.  This command will get it done for you:\nrsync -a /path/to/backup /place/to/put/it\nI like rsync because it's sole purpose is to intelligently synchronize directories and their contents.  Rsync maintains all file attributes, and also copies hidden files.  It does not recopy files that have not changed since the last backup.  I prefer this because it provides direct and quick access to the copies without any special programs.  They are simply copies of my files, in the exact layout as the original.  This method will not store previous backups however, so that is something to consider if you care about previous backups.  I personally don't want to use the disk space on backup history.  \nTo schedule it on a cron job, open up the crontab like so:\ncrontab -e\nThen add this line:\n01 02 * * * rsync -a /path/to/backup /place/to/put/it\nThis will run the job every night/morning at 2:01 AM.  Full instructions here.\n\nA: Use \"Deja Dup\" (also known as \"Backup\"). Set the \"How often to backup\" in \"Schedule\" tab to \"Daily\"\n\nA: You can use Unison, which is available from the Ubuntu repos. You can install it via software center.\nIt builds over the rsync, and syncs edits and deletes from multiple places. So if you have data files which are present on multiple machines, then editing files on one machine would give you tough time while syncing in other machine. Multiple edits (to different files) across such server copies are also tough to sync with rsync.\nUnison handles all this, and gives you a clean CLI or GUI to work with. Version 2.40.65 recommended.\nYou must install the same version of unison at both primary(ies) and backup server(s).\n", "Q: What are the design guidelines for appindicator icons? I am creating a Unity AppIndicator using Python + PyGObject, but I wish for it's icon to be in standard Ubuntu style. Where can I find appropriate guidelines for using colours (or is it just white/transparent?), or at least icons of standard AppIndicators?

If I put it in the same folder, as the .py file, how should I refer to it in the code?\n\nA: To use custom icon located in python script folder, use this way (PyGI code snippet)\nappindicator.Indicator.new_with_path (\n   \"indicator-name\",\n   \"icon-name\",\n   appindicator.IndicatorCategory.APPLICATION_STATUS,\n   os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))\n\n", "Q: Enable global terminal movement keys In terminal I can use:\nCtrl + H → Backspace\nCtrl + M → Return (Enter)\nCtrl + F → Forward\nCtrl + B → Backward\nCtrl + N → Next\nCtrl + P → Previous\nCtrl + A → Beginning of line (Home)\nCtrl + E → End of line (End)\nAnd I would like to have these shortcuts work globally.

If anyone can find a way to fix this without deleting Windows 7 or its files, i will be grateful. \nHere are my partitions:\n/dev/sda1 ntfs 172854MB Windows 7(loader)  (my C: drive)\n\n/dev/sda2 ext4 296351MB Ubuntu 13.04 (my D: drive)\n\n/dev/sda3 ntfs 26843MB Windows Recovery Environment (loader)\n\n/dev/sda4 biosgrub 148MB\n\n/dev/sda5 swap 195MB\n\nagain any help would be appreciated, thank you.\n\nA: When I did a dual-boot install of Ubuntu 12.10 it insisted that my options were to\neither wipe the XP install and install on the internal drive, or it would set up\nthe dual-boot install on my USB hard drive, so I let it do the second option.\nI then found that (suspect) the grub loader startup was very dependent on the USB\ndevices enumerating exactly as they were when it installed.  If there was any change\nto the USB lineup, e.g. a thumbdrive plugged into the USB hub, the system was dead,\nbut put it back like it was at install and all was good.\nThe symptom sounds kinda' like yours, tho' I'm not sure your linux partition is on\na USB device.  I'm thinking not?  Thought I'd toss it out.\nBenton 1may30\nEpilogue: a month later my XP install became unbootable for reasons unknown, but I\nwas able to mount the NTFS drive with Linux and copy everything I wanted off to\nanother drive, then re-ran the install, this time wiping XP.

Wow, and I really did love this OS at one time. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET PASS THE BLACK SCREEN SINCE YESTERDAY MORNING. CAN SOMEONE AT LEAST TELL ME HOW TO GET IT UP? SO I CAN AT LEAST SEE THE SCREEN AGAIN? I NEVER HAD ONE PROBLEM WITH 12.04 UNTIL I HIT 12.04.2 AND 13.04. I've never had this problem until recently and don't know if it has something to do with Ubuntu being on a SATA HDD and LinuxMint 14 on a IDE HDD.\nWhen I move my mouse to awake the computer, the monitor light goes from orange to blue so I know the monitor comes on - however the screen is solid black. Sometimes when I restart I watch my HDD light when it stops blinking. I'm guessing its at GRUB menu so i press Enter, then it will come to my first option to allow to sign in which I can see, and sometimes it doesn't. I have HDMI, but I'm running DVI. I can't see my first option in GRUB, I just press Enter, and then I see my sign in screen.\nAfter several times of pushing the restart button on my computer it finally comes up, but it takes quite a few tries.\n\nWhen I am on LinuxMint HDD, the same thing happens there as well.\nI have a Radeon HD 6500 graphics card and tried several different drivers (open source and proprietary), but nothing fixed it. I am now using AMD Catalyst 13.4 driver, which works great, except for this issue.\nI've researched Google and tried a few things but nothing works and this is getting very old fast.\nDoes anyone know how to fix this?\nIf the computer goes to sleep and I wake it within 3 minutes, it comes up fine, with no issues, but if it goes to sleep for awhile, an hour or so, it has this issue.\nI am using the 3.5.0-28-generic kernel as well as the newest quantal x stack.\nChecking my BIOS -  I am already set to \"s3\". I'm not really sure I want to suspend to hard drive since suspend to ram was working. I have also tried the \"acpi_sleep=old_ordering\" trick in Grub boot options to no avail.\nTo add to this, when I added LinuxMint, on second HDD I unplugged my SATA HDD from computer that had Ubuntu on it, then installed LinuxMint 14 on the IDE HDD. Once installed, I then plugged my SATA drive back up and ran sudo update-grub.\n\nAs I've been reading more on Ubuntu 12.04.2, I wonder if when my kernel and xorg stack updated to quantal if this is my issue... Is there a way to roll back to an older kernel to test this? I can't remember correctly right now, but this issue might have started when I put LinuxMint 14 on the IDE HDD and thats equivalent to Ubuntu 12.10, right? Could this be the issue? The new xorg and kernel? Although my boot priority in BIOS loads my SATA drive which has 12.04 Ubuntu on it first anyway, but also has been updated to the new quantal kernel. I set a link here to my xorg file, hoping it might help some as well.\nUpdate 1:\nI just tried to run memtest from Grub menu, and I get an error \"too small lower memory (0x99100 >0x99800)\". The test doesn't start and I have 2 entries of memtest in Grub2. I am running 8gigs of ram, gigabyte socket 775 board, quad-core setup. I'm not having any crashes, my memory shows up in system monitor.\nI've just researched this issue. Seems its a bug, but would it affect my S3 setting in BIOS?\nUpdate 2:\nJust switched from S3 to S1. It Doesn't work neither.\nI've noticed in my xorg log file that I'm receiving some errors\n(EE) open /dev/dri/card0: No such file or directory,,,,,\n(EE) open /dev/fb0: No such file or directory,,,,,\n(WW) Falling back to old probe method for fglrx,,,,,,,\n(WW) fglrx: No matching Device section for instance (BusID PCI:0@1:0:1) found,,,,,,,\n(WW) Falling back to old probe method for vesa,,,,,,,,\n(WW) Falling back to old probe method for modesetting,,,,\n(WW) Falling back to old probe method for fbdev,,,,,\n(WW) fglrx(0): board is an unknown third party board, chipset is supported......\n\nI have also upgraded to 13.04 and still fighting this issue. I've tried nomodeset in Grub and yet [nothing is working](my xorg.conf).\nUpdate 3:\nToday, as usual, when my computer rebooted and came back up, I couldn't see anything but a black screen. Not even BIOS or Grub. However, I assumed that Ubuntu was highlighted in the Grub and pressed Enter. Then I see my HDD light lit up, then hear the Ubuntu chime. I attempted several reboots, for about 30 minutes. Then I become frustrated on last attempt and did this - while my computer was running I unhooked my DVI cable from the graphics card and then hooked it back up. And all of a sudden I no longer had the black screen. I could see my desktop finally. Does this help anyone out there to help me fix this issue?\nAnother thing I've noticed is my LinuxMint HDD is /sda1, while my Ubuntu SATA HDD is /sdb. Should the Grub be on /sda1?\n\nThis is my syslog picture.\n\nA: I have experienced this issue many times with windows let alone ubuntu, Mint, Debian and the like. I tend not to use suspend for this reason, but it has worked on Ubuntu 12.04 and earlier for me, but is highly dependent on your motherboard and video card. \nThe first thing you must do which you have done is make sure suspend to RAM (S3) is enabled in the motherboard BIOS. Following on from that in the motherboard BIOS ensure that hard drive spindown is disabled and DPMS is enabled (also try disabling this if it is enabled, that is if the option is in the BIOS). \nAlso ensure if the option is available, set the 'Plug 'n play operating system installed' set to YES. Recently on Ubuntu I stopped using the ATI and Nvidia drivers and use the Ubuntu one as I found them buggy, booting to a black screen, no desktop and constant crashing. It helps some times to list out the hardware ie motherboard, RAM, Power supply, video card as it can give an idea of a buggy ACPI setup in a BIOS which can be resolved with a BIOS update or slightly incompatible components. \n\nA: This will occur rarely in dual boot. First you have to identify whether your display settings are same as that your display(15.6 or 13.6..etc..,) has in Ubuntu, After that check out Display adjustment and how many displays are present over there. After all these check-ins u will get your normal screen as earlier you have.\n\nA: I'm going to put in my two cents.  I have a similar setup, Ubuntu 12.04LTS, and Debian 6.  I just checked my BIOS, and the settings are below:\nACPI Function Enabled\nACPI Standby State S1\n\nI have Ubuntu and Debian both with the latest updates as of 5/10/2013.  I use mostly Ubuntu, and sometimes it goes to sleep for days.  But no matter how long it sleeps, it always wakes up with no problems.  I have ATI (AMD)Radeon Graphics, with the latest AMD Catalyst 13.4 Proprietary Linux x86 Display Driver. \nAs I mentioned I have mine set to S1, and since you have yours set to S3, with deals with RAM, I would suggest that you set your ACPI to S1, test your RAM, and maybe see if there is a BIOS update to your system board.    \n\nA: Same problem on my laptop. I made it work but i don't know if this will help you, but you can try.\nThis is most known on intel vgas but on the reference link there are something about ati and nvidia to.\n\nForce Pipe A Quirk This problem typically exhibits itself on Intel \n  graphics hardware (most particularly i855) by locking up the machine \n  when closing the lid. The fix for this issue is to quirk your card to \n  force enabling Pipe A. If you suspect you're having this bug, try \n  setting this option in your xorg.conf:\n Section \"Device\"\n     ..\n     Option \"ForceEnablePipeA\" \"true\" EndSection\n\n\nFore more reference visit the source of the above quote:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Quirks#Force_Pipe_A_Quirk\n", "Q: Cannot use bash tab complete in tmux I just install tmux on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and it throws me this error when I try to use tab completion for simple commands like 'cd' or 'mv' in the /etc/bash_completion file.\ncommand substitution: line 74: syntax error near unexpected token `done'\n\nHowever, I can use tab completion in my normal terminal or in byobu.

To get internet, do you have an Ethernet cable you can plug into your computer and after wait-wait-wait (2 mins - 4 mins) you should at the least have a wired internet connection. I still can't figure out the issue, other than this issue started with 13.04 first update.\n\nA: i would do what gm-script-writer-62850 mention and check to make sure your network interface card (nic) and its driver is supported by ubuntu.  sometimes ubuntu does not support certain drivers which you can find out on what drivers they support on ubuntu's website, after using the command gm-script-writer-62850 mentioned to find what ur nic card is which can tell you on ubuntu website if its supported.  if its not, then if you have a desktop computer all you have to do is add a nic card that is supported by ubuntu instead.

If you would like to do this open a terminal and change to your KeePass directory.\nThen type:\nmimeopen -d KeePass.exe\n\nYou will see that there will be options asking what you want the default open to be, you will select the number that has the option 'Other' and when prompted:\nmono %f\n\nThis should allow it into the Open With list.

I'm using Desktop 12.04. I run Windows XP for testing Lazarus and the guest OS is on Virtual Box.\nEvery few times a month, the Ubuntu update causes the Virtual Box to stop working. i.e., when I run the virtual box, it insists that I recompile some kernel module. Well, it's no big deal, but is there a way to avoid this? Can't it be automated or not stop working?\nThis development machine hardly shuts off and having to reboot the guest OS means a lot of time wasted because there are so many files/sessions open.\nThanks!\n\nA: VirtualBox User Manual, \"The VirtualBox kernel module\":\n\nIf DKMS is available and installed, the VirtualBox kernel module should always work automatically, and it will be automatically rebuilt if your host kernel is updated.\nIf DKMS is not already installed, execute one of the following: On an Ubuntu system:sudo apt-get install dkms\nOtherwise, there are only two situations in which you will need to worry about the kernel module: (...)\n\n\n*\n\n*The kernel of your Linux host was updated and DKMS is not installed. In that case, the kernel module will need to be reinstalled by executing (as root):\n\n/etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup\n\n\n\nA: If you install a kernel update then you are going to have to recompile Virtual Box kernel modules for it to work once you boot with the new kernel. You could not install any new kernel updates.\nI am not sure why you would have to reboot the guest OS. Recompiling of kernel modules should be done with the host machine and shouldn't change the state of the guest OS.\n", "Q: how can I change file association globally? gedit is set by default to open about any source file. I've gone through the file properties and changed default application to VIM for C and C++ files.\nI'd need to do this for any source file I open now, for python files, for text files, for ruby, any, since gedit is set to open all of them.\nHow can I change this to open with VIM without going the hassle of setting \"open with\" one by one?\n\nA: Seems like the answer here\nis actually the easiest, specifically going to a file's properties, going to the \"open with\" tab, and then setting as default for that file type. Here's the picture:\n\n\nA: I guess the easiest graphical way would be: \nFiles (nautilus) >> select a file >> right click & Properties  >> \"Open With\" tab >> select a program you fancy >> \"Select as default\". Done.\nThis method comes from this post on HowToGeek: http://www.howtogeek.com/117709/how-to-change-your-default-applications-on-ubuntu-4-ways/ where they also talk about how to change default Terminal programs. \n\nA: \nThis answer only works in Ubuntu 16.04 or prior; the comments have a link to a Xenial release of Ubuntu-Tweak. In newer versions of Ubuntu this will not work as Ubuntu-Tweak is no longer supported by the author.\nComments have suggested that Chris Marx answer below is the right way, but it does not resolve the answer of administrative management - for example, setting the type for many items.\nNote: Ubuntu 16.04 is still LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 is not EOL\n\nThe EASIEST way for you to do this would be to install the program Ubuntu Tweak.\n\n*\n\n*How do I install Ubuntu-Tweak?\n\n*http://www.ubuntuupdates.org/package/getdeb_apps/xenial/apps/getdeb/ubuntu-tweak\nOnce you have it downloaded you simply open it up, change to Admins tab and then under System choose File Type Manager. Once in here select the file category Text and using shift-click and/or control-click select all of the file types you want, then click Edit on the bottom right.\nThis will allow you to multi-set the mimetype opener for all of the files.\nSee screen:\n\n\nA: speaking about how things works globally, for the entire system, the most important thing is\n/usr/share/applications/defaults.list\n\nwhich is the file that holds the associations between a given mime type and the application that is supposed to handle that kind of file.\nIf you don't know the mime type of a file simply use the command\nmimetype\n\nlike so\nmimetype img.jpg \nimg.jpg: image/jpeg\n\ntext files, python scripts, web pages, usually any given file has its own mime type.\n\nA: touch ~/.local/share/applications/defaults.list\n\nAdd the following lines to ~/.local/share/applications/defaults.list\n[Default Applications]\ntext/plain=gvim.desktop\n\nNow every file on your machine will open with gvim, by default.\n\nA: Go to Details from Unity Dash, click on Default Applications on the left pane.

I'm not amazing with computers, and am having extreme difficulty figuring out how to install Ubuntu, whether it's dual boot or a full install.\nCan someone tell me how exactly I go about doing this?\n-Brad\n\nA: You need netboot / PXE boot.\nYou need to setup a PXE boot server.

I couldn't find an option in Preferences.\nIf possible, I'd like to avoid a roll-back as I hate to fight progress, but if that's the only option I'll take it.\n\nA: Nautilus 3.6+ has removed or changed many good features it had in older versions; One is the typical search you mentioned. You have two options, one is to change your file browser from nautilus to \"nemo\" or something similar; another is to use non-official patched nautilus, named \"SolusOS\". \n", "Q: I cant boot windows!

What do they mean?\nntfs\n/dev/sda/\n/dev/sda1/\n/\n\nA: You'll need to give more information to get a better answer.\nYou need to identify what you're trying to do. Are you installing Ubuntu alongside of Windows or other operating systems? If so, your objective is slightly more difficult. If you're just trying to replace your whole hard drive with Ubuntu, then you're on the easy track.\n/dev/sda is usually the device file of the main hard drive on your computer.\nYour disk can have one or more partitions. /dev/sda1 is the first partition on your hard drive. You're most likely going to want to install the root of your Ubuntu installation on /dev/sda1 if you're using the whole hard drive for Ubuntu. Otherwise you'll want to partition your drive up and install Ubuntu on a different partition.\nntfs is a type of filesystem often used by Windows.\nPlease give more information regarding your question or it will be marked as too vague.\n", "Q: What is the right way to gain sudo privileges I have just created a new Rackspace cloud server and I need to set it up.\nI created a new user with the adduser command and currently the user is only in a group with the same name.

If guest session creates the entire user and everything, when running, then erases it all.

If you're using GRUB, then Frank's suggestion might work, at least in the short term. (There might be problems if/when further kernel upgrades come along, should the working 3.5.0 kernel be deleted.)\nIt sounds like you may be using the EFI stub loader, though. If so, you should be aware that some users have begun having problems with it in the 3.7.x and 3.8.x series. The cause isn't yet clear. This thread on the Arch Linux forum discusses the issue in detail. If you're running into this problem, then either a reconfiguration of your boot manager to boot 3.5.0 by default or switching from the EFI stub loader to another boot loader (such as GRUB 2 or ELILO) is in order. Reconfiguring your boot manager requires knowing which one you're using, and perhaps how you're using it.\n\nA: In your /boot directory you will find two kernel images - two files named initrd.img-3....\nKeep them.\nUsing the Ubuntu Software Center install the Grub Customizer Program \nIn the List Configuration tab of that program you can drag & drop the 3.5-image before the 3.8-image.\nSo your system will automatically boot the 3.5-kernel.\n", "Q: More elaborate manual installation instructions I'm on another platform than Ubuntu, but would like to test Ubuntu Touch on a Nexus 7.

Any longer distance or my body between the router and notebook drops signal dramatically.\niwconfig reports txpower 20 dBm:\n$ iwconfig\neth1      no wireless extensions.\n\nlo        no wireless extensions.\n\nwlan0     IEEE 802.11bgn  ESSID:\"ZyXEL_KEENETIC_LITE_3EFA9B\"  \n          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.457 GHz  Access Point: C8:6C:87:3E:FA:9B   \n          Bit Rate=150 Mb/s   Tx-Power=20 dBm   \n          Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr=2347 B   Fragment thr:off\n          Power Management:off\n          Link Quality=70/70  Signal level=-14 dBm  \n          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0\n          Tx excessive retries:0  Invalid misc:28819   Missed beacon:0\n\nReducing it to 0 dBm with sudo iwconfig wlan0 txpower 0 seem to have no effect.\nSignal level reported by iwconfig seem to jump randomly from -90 to +15 dBm (or even once maybe I've seen +26 dBm, not sure).\nAt a close distance (~30 cm) iwconfig reportes -30 dBm most of the time, but sometimes jumps to something ramdom (+10 dBm, -70 dBm, -90 dBm... )\nAlso, at a longer distance -60 dBm seems to be more likely to be reported by iwconfig, but random jumps are more often and it's hard to say for sure.\nEverything seems like a transmitter power or signal correctness problem. But in windows everything goes OK.\nMay be, the driver does not work with the chip correctly, but works somehow.\nThe kernel module rtl8723ae seems to be loaded:\n$ lsmod | grep rtl87\nrtl8723ae              86459  0 \nrtlwifi                79673  1 rtl8723ae\n\nIt there anything I can do with this?\nThe notebook was bought for use with ubuntu mainly, but with such a wifi it is not quite usable =(\n\nA: Anatol,\nI experience a similar problem with my laptop. However, when I do\nsudo iwconfig wlan0 txpower 30\n\n...then,\nsudo iwconfig wlan0 essid MyESSID key xxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n...I get connected.\nI have a modem very close to my desktop, with no wall interfering, and sometimes I connect, sometimes not.

It worked well on ubuntu 12.10 but now, after reinstalling fresh copy of ubuntu 13.04 it installs fluently but does not do anything else, no errors no pop-ups, nothing, what should I do to make it work? Maybe I need to install some kind of packages?\nAs I mentioned before I'm using ubuntu 13.04 (32 bit) \n\nA: Just create new folder \".pulse\"  in your home\n\nA: i have the same problem in Ubuntu Raring 13.04 and i can solve with this solution, because the autor not yet design a version of this program for ubuntu Saucy Salamander, (13.10) that i am using now.\nThe equalizer for pulseaudio not installed well in ubuntu 13.04 because it was designed to run until such time ubuntu 12.04 .\nThe solution I found is:\n\ngo to the terminal , in the dash , open it and press enter:\n\nWith the open terminal write :\n\nCode :\n\nsudo add -apt -repository ppa : psyke83/ppa\n\n( This command searches the repository , called PPA where this pulseaudio equalizer , but it will not find the file )\n\nWrite apt- get update and press enter to update . Dara a message that the repository pulseaudio -equalizer for Raring not yet .\n\nCode :\n\nsudo apt- get update\n\nThen reboot .\n\nThe solution is to search the site ppa : psyke83/ppa in google and get pulseaudio -equalizer first :\n\nhttp://ppa.launchpad.net/psyke83/ppa...er_2.7_all.deb\n\nOnce downloaded this file, you need to install two units :\n\nladspa -sdk\nswh -plugins\n\nFrom where to get :\n\nUbuntu Packages looking Raring :\n\nhttp://ubuntu.mirror.cambrium.nl/ubu...untu1_i386.deb\n\nhttp://mirror.anl.gov/pub/ubuntu//po...5+1-7_i386.deb\n\nWhen trying to install with Gdebi , you may ask the other files and do not install them. In that case you need to open pulseaudio - equalize and allow the system to download and install the files by pressing install the machine connected to the network. When installing the program everything seems normal\nbut the run does not work. These are the causes and how the fix :\n\nFile pulseaudio -equalizer installed and pulseaudio pulseaudio -equalizer -equalizer -gtk in usr / bin , with presets files in share / pulseaudio -equalizer , containing the configuration of the sound system. The system when trying to run , look at the user account to search the hidden folder . / Pulse , to find the same configuration does not exist.\nTo create it you should go to Nautilus , preferences, and choose to show hidden files , close and reopen it to see the hidden files . Then you can create a new folder called . / Press. and left open nautilus\n\nThe system also seeks the. / Presets , which should be in / home / user account / . / Press / presets , which will be empty. To copy the files you requested , open pulseaudio - equalizer_2.7_all.deb with archive manager :\n\nThen go open each folder to this location / usr / share / pulseaudio -equalizer . Here you will find the presets folder , which is precisely where the program asks . It can be extracted to the folder / home / user account, and from there copy it to the folder. / Pulse , and stay well :\n\n/ home / user account. / press / presets\n\nThe system installs a file called pulseaudio - equalizer.py in the / usr / share / pulseaudio -equalizer , and this tells how to run the equalizer.\nThe script looks for a file called gnome -volume- control.svg in this folder, but the file is not found.\nInside the terminal , it should execute the command : sudo nautilus, then type your password and search for this file in the folder usr / share / pulseaudio -equalizer and abirlo with gedit for editing.\nOnce you open the file with gedit by double clicking within the pulseaudio - equalizer.py file to look for this line:\n\nicon = self.window.set_icon_from_file (\"/ usr/share/icons/hicolor/16x16/apps/gnome-volume-control.svg \" )\n\nChanging to this location :\n\nicon = self.window.set_icon_from_file (\"/ usr/share/icons/Humanity/apps/16/gnome-volume-control.svg \" )\n\nClose the file and all open windows and open the program from the unity dash looking pulseaudio -equalizer .

So I used 0 instead, and lo' and behold. Lots more nvidia- utilities in the PATH.\nIf you're not on 64-bit, then use i386 instead of x86_64.\n\nA: For those of you that end up in this thread when shooting in the Google dark because nvidia drivers are loaded, but all graphics in X go through the CPU instead of the GPU.\nSymptoms\n\n\n*\n\n*nvidia drivers were loaded correctly (lsmod | grep nvidia)\n\n*under X, nvidia-settings was reporting no issues accessing my GTX 680 GPU\n\n\nBUT\n\n\n*\n\n*any graphics-intensive program would drive CPU load unusually high, instead of the expected load on the GPU. For example, games would stutter even at an animated main menu, glxgears (from the mesa-utils package) would load the CPU up to 10%, unigine load test would show FPS around 2 and lock up on first scene.\n\n\nThe misleading factor was that nvidia-settings was not reporting any problems accessing the GPU. I did what most threads suggested (purged and reinstalled nvidia drivers), but to no effect. In desperation I finally checked Xorg.0.log in /var/log: it turned out that X was loading it's own libglx.so module instead of nvidia's. Now that I was asking the right question, I got the proper answer (Xorg loads wrong libglx.so).\nSolution\nOriginally the Files section in my /etc/X11/xorg.conf was empty:\nSection \"Files\"\nEndSection \n\nI found where nvidia keeps its own libglx.so (more precisely, I found where it keeps  a symlink to it). The solution is to tell X to first look for modules in nvidia's path, and then in Xorg's path, so the Files section now looks like this:\nSection \"Files\"\n    ModulePath \"/usr/lib/nvidia\"\n    ModulePath \"/usr/lib/xorg/modules\"\nEndSection \n\nI'm on Debian, but as Ubuntu is based on Debian, a similar approach should work on Ubuntu systems.\n\nA: Install latest nvidia drivers\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-313-updates\nGenerate /etc/X11/xorg.conf by executing\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\nThen execute\nsudo software-properties-gtk which will show you a window like this\n\nSelect the latest driver from that list and then do\nsudo reboot\n\nA: I experienced problem with nvidia module not found after update too.

I too had this problem before. I solved it by deleting these directories and restarting the computer. You cannot delete them from the file browser or explorer. So, super user permissions are required to delete them.

Remove the\n  extension's directory, and then restart the Shell. The extension\n  should be stored under ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions.\n  Removing the directory won't be enough: you will need to restart the\n  Shell to make sure the extension is completely uninstalled: open the\n  run dialog with Alt+F2, and enter restart.\n\nSo, You'll Be Fine removing extension under ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions manually. \n\nA: OK, found it.

I'm working with a software that uses VDB (VistaDB) to archive log files, while everyone else uses windows and can use the Vistadb software, I'm unable to do so using my Ubuntu OS, does anyone knows how can those file be viewed under Linux ?\n\nA: The following I found while looking at this ...\n\n*\n\n*VistaDB is an Embedded SQL Database Engine for .Net and mono.\n\n*It uses Blowfish encryption to encrypt the database content.\n\n*Anyone with a license that has the database can open it and use their own program to connect but I only saw Windows software that can do this.\n\nThe only mentioning of Linux in regards to vistaDB is this reply, though the full reply is more about android:\n\nVistaDB may work under Mono, but we do not have the resources to test and validate it for Mono, so such use is considered \"experimental\". In theory, it can work in Mono--such as under Linux on a PC.\nWhen we took over VistaDB we had to focus our efforts on the core product for standard machines and operating systems (ie. various versions of Windows).\n\nWhen we have alternatives like MySQL, SQLite and Firebird not a lot of Linux users will be tempted to buy a license and install Windows to use it. So you are probably on your own here (not saying it is not possible in Linux with mono but you would need to do a lot of experimenting yourself).\n\nA: If the database was built for VistaDB 4.x (*.vdb4), you're out of luck.  However, 3.x (*.vdb3) works fine under WINE.  Can't confirm with 2.x (*.vdb) since I can't find that version.\n", "Q: SSH vs SMB vs NFS for GUI file transfer I am using Ubuntu 12.04 on many computers at my school (I am a teacher and the head tech dude).  I use Clonezilla to massively clone desktops and laptops.  I want to easily share the disk images between computers in order to back things up.  \nI tried sharing over our wireless network using samba, and I did get it to work, but it was painfully slow trying to transfer 3GB+.  It was much faster over the wired network, but I still had connectivity issues.  Correct me if I'm wrong but I understand that samba is based on a windows standard, and that SSH is more Linux-native.  My experience with samba has not been favorable so far.  \nNFS seems to have more features than samba.  I think this is what Mac OS uses by default.\nSo, my question is: what is the best GUI way to share files between two Ubuntu machines with the following priorities in descending order:\n\n\n*\n\n*speed\n\n*free and open source\n\n*easy setup\n\n*compatible with Windows and Mac OS\n\n\nA: NFS is easy to set up, fast, and easy to use, but is not designed for security (plaintext file transfers).  You might want to look at sshfs, which can be used to create mount points similar to NFS but in a secure way, and in my own humble testing had  similar performance to NFS.  sshfs can be used to locally access any folder you can access on another system over the network which has an SSH server running.  Also, sshfs operates in user space so you don't need to be root to set it up.\nGetting either of these to work on Windows will probably be challenging, but both will work on Mac.\nThe SMB protocol has always seemed clunky to me, so I haven't used it much, but I understand that Samba's implementation is solid.  I can't speak to it's performance or ease of use in general.\n\nA: You are right, SMB is something coming originally from Windows. But nowadays it works great with Linux and Mac as well.\nSince speed is important, you have to keep in mind: SSH is a great thing for everything connected to Unix/Linux and networks, but it is really slow compared to NFS, FTP or SMB.\nNFS is the fastest, but it is not encrypted. Do not use any unencrypted protocols if you can't fully trust your network (see also this Q&A). NFS should be available for Windows and Mac too, but it might be a bit of work to set it up.\nSMB should be easy to set up on Windows, Linux and Mac and it is still reasonable fast compared to SSH. But the same warning about security holds for SMB (see this Q&A).\nSome similar questions were discussed here.\nThere are also [many benchmarks] about the speed of different network protocols out there.\n\nA: Popular file hosting protocols are such few: NFS, SMB, SFTP, FTPS, WebDAV.\nClassify the file hosting services in 2 dimension:\n\n*\n\n*Serving range\n\n*Data's legal ownership\n\nIn the dimension of serving range, they are categorized into\n\n*\n\n*LAN service\n\n*Internet service\n\nIn the dimension of data ownership, they are categorized into\n\n*\n\n*Public service\n\n*Private service\n\nPrivate service means the users own the server's address.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivate service\nPublic service\n\n\n\n\nLAN service\nSynology NAS; AWS EFS;\n\n\n\nInternet service\nAWS S3; Alibaba OSS;\nOneDrive; iCloud;\n\n\n\n\nWhich protocol should be used depends on which category of the file hosting service you are providing.\nPublic Internet service\n\n*\n\n*SMB and NFS don't support unlimited transferring buffer or unlimited slide window, so they have a bad performance on high latency network, e.g. the Internet.\n\n*FTPS doesn't support range reading. It can specify the beginning byte of a read operation, but cannot specify the ending byte. So when you are watching a stream video over FTPS, the player has to buffer the entire file, which may exceeds the memory.\n\n*SFTP is built over SSH rather than TLS, so a client cannot authenticate the server automatically by the OS's built-in CAs. As a service provider, you cannot guarantee your users connect to your genuine server rather than a hacker's server.\n\nSo, the only choice has to be WebDAV.\nPrivate Internet service\n\n*\n\n*SMB and NFS don't support unlimited transferring buffer or unlimited slide window, so they have a bad performance on high latency network, e.g. the Internet.\n\n*FTPS doesn't support range reading.

So when you are watching a stream video over FTPS, the player has to buffer the entire file, which may exceeds the memory.\n\n*WebDAV can range read, but cannot range write.\n\n*The most popular version of SFTP (v3) cannot lock files on the server.\n\nSo, SMB/NFS is the best choice.\nGUI\nEvery protocol can have a GUI on any OS, because you can mount it to a directory and access it with your native file manager application.\n", "Q: Where are flex libraries located? I find myself with a very weird problem in my hands. I wanted to install both flex (the fast lexical analyzer) and bison, and that's why I ran:\nsudo apt-get install bison flex\n\nThe installation goes on without errors and, as a matter of fact, if I type\ndpkg -L flex\n\nI end up with a list of entries which includes\n/usr/lib\n\nAnd, in that path, I expect to find the flex libraries (which as far as I know are libfl.a or libfl.so, depending if the installation was shared or static), but, lo and behold, there's no libfl library under /usr/lib, and using\nfind -L 'libfl.a' (or 'libfl.so')\n\nreturns only\nNo such file or directory\n\nI'm completely puzzled...where should flex libraries be located? \nThanks\n\nA: The files are in the libfl-dev package, which is a dependency of flex. The package is Multi-Arch enabled, so the files are under the /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/ or /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ directory, depending on whether you are on 32 or 64 bit. Or possibly under /usr/lib/armhf-linux-gnu/ if you are on ARM.\n", "Q: How to backup Ubuntu partition via Windows? I wanted to make a backup of my Ubuntu (12.04) partition before upgrading to 13.04, but I've come up against a snag. None of the tools I can find can make an image of the currently-mounted drive - and, for obvious reasons, it's not possible to unmount the drive which is currently used as /. The Ubuntu partition is the only one in my system that doesn't use NTFS, and all of the boot-from-cd options I've found warn against trying to save to NTFS from a livecd.\nMy system is a dual-boot with Windows 7, so I figured it might be possible to use that to make the image, thereby getting around both of the problems (not having the Linux partition mounted and safely saving to NTFS) - but my Google-fu is coming up short and all I can seem to find is a) tools for imaging an NTFS partition from within Linux (the opposite to my problem) or b) tools for just reading individual files from ext (not the most helpful, as they don't give any write capabilities for restoring).\nIs there any way of doing this?\n\nA: If I understand correctly what you were trying to do - i.e. make a disk image of Ubuntu from a booted version of Windows - you could have used a utility such as Macrium Reflect Free Edition (http://www.macrium.com/reflectfree.aspx).  This program will make an image of an entire hard disk - or one or more individual partitions.  It includes a backup of the Master Boot Record (MBR) so that, for example, restoring the Ubuntu partition of a dual-boot hard disk also \"refreshes\" grub.  Clonezilla would also work (in a live-CD or bootable-USB version) under Linux but, in my opinion, is less user-friendly than Macrium Reflect's GUI.\n\nA: I am not sure if it will help you. I was also using 1204 and upgraded to 1304 without taking any backup (As no important data was there in my single partitioned drive). After the upgrade all of my data was lying there as it was never touched.\n", "Q: python idle offline installer Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.\nSurprisingly, IDLE is not included by default.\nPython is there.\nI prefer to download tar.gz or .deb installer for IDLE.\nGoogled to look for it, but could not find.\nWhere can I get the installer for IDLE?  \nThanks,\nVineet\n\nA: There are two versions of IDLE in the repositories in 12.04\nFor Python 2.7 sudo apt-get install idle-python2.7\nFor Python 3.2 sudo apt-get install idle-python3.2\nAnd two In 13.04\nFor Python 2.7 sudo apt-get install idle-python2.7\nFor Python 3.3 sudo apt-get install idle-python3.3\nIn a terminal CTRL+ALT+T\n", "Q: Dual boot Windows 8 and Ubuntu UEFI! Can't load windows 8 anymore I have a samsung laptop with windows 8 single language pre installed and since it was bugging so much I decided to dual boot with ubuntu following this guide : http://www.linuxbsdos.com/2013/03/12/dual-boot-windows-8-and-ubuntu-12-04-in-uefi-mode/\nI was able to install ubuntu, and could load both from ubuntu boot loader. I had an issue where in my BIOS, in my boot priority ALL entries were gone except ubuntu. Then second issue, I couldn't load windows boot manager even after following the guide. So i tried playing with the easyBCD and I screwed up by deleting all entries in windows boot manager. Now, even on ubuntu boot loader, I can't load windows. On the ubuntu boot loader i see about 5-8 entries, 3-4 of them from ubuntu and the rest is some *x64.efi and recovery boots. I tried all of them and couldn't load windows. Either File is not found or when i go in windows boot manager, no operating system detected. I don't know what to do, I can't have access to my windows 8 any help please? Note that i could boot windows 8 from ubuntu loader by pressing enter on some **x64.efi but couldn't since I played with easyBCD. \nHere is a paste of boot repair i just did http://paste.ubuntu.com/5623621/\n\nA: *\n\n*Try re-booting with the live-CD (USB) from your installed Ubuntu distro.\n\n*Don't change the partition table that exists on your harddisk. Don't wipe it out!!! Keep it. \n\n*Reinstall Ubuntu - use exactly the same partitions that you used the first time to install Ubuntu in. \n\n*During this install choose to install the GRUBbootloader in the Masterbootrecord of your harddisk. This will overwrite the Windows bootloader. \n\n*Reboot. Grub should be able to see Windows. \n\nA: First, you should be aware that recent Samsung laptops have a known EFI bug that can brick the computer, requiring it to be returned to Samsung for repair. This bug can be triggered in any OS, including Windows. Thus, it's best to completely wipe the hard disk and re-install both Windows and Linux in BIOS mode. That's extremely awkward, though, and there have been some recent Linux kernel patches that make it unlikely that the bug will be triggered in Linux -- if you're running the relevant code. Unfortunately, I don't happen to know precisely which kernels have this fix, so I'm not sure which kernels are safe and which ones aren't. In the absence of that information, you should run the latest kernel available and hope for the best or reconfigure everything to boot in BIOS mode. I'll proceed with the assumption that you're running a safe kernel and are willing to take the risk of bricking your computer from Windows.\nBased on the Boot Info Script output you've posted, the GRUB 2 entry entitled \"Windows UEFI bkpbootmgfw.efi\" should work; however, GRUB 2 is extremely finicky about chainloading to other EFI boot loaders. Sometimes an entry that should work doesn't work, or will work only on some computers. Therefore, I recommend you try the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Launch Boot Repair.\n\n*Click \"Advanced Options.\"\n\n*Select the \"Main Options\" tab.\n\n*Select \"Restore EFI Backups\". The \"Backup and Rename EFI Files\" option should automatically uncheck. If it doesn't, uncheck it yourself.\n\n*Click Apply.\n\n*In your regular Debian installation (not an emergency/live disc), download the Debian-package version of my rEFInd boot manager.\n\n*Install the rEFInd package.\n\n*Reboot. Instead of GRUB, rEFInd should appear. It should let you boot Windows, GRUB (which should appear with an Ubuntu icon, and chainload to Linux), or Linux (which will probably appear as one or more penguin icons).\n\n\nAssuming this all goes smoothly, you can then customize rEFInd in various ways. Chances are you'll have some redundant entries in rEFInd's menu, for instance; or you may want to tweak its appearance or change its options. The rEFInd documentation describes how to do this.\n", "Q: partition wiped after distribution update My problem: a partition and its files disappeared unbeknownst to me, most likely after updating from 12.10 to 13.04 (though not sure).\nBefore Ubuntu 12.10 I was running Windows 7, with a hard drive of 250 GB partitioned in two: drive C and drive D.

Insert your bootable disc/USB device. Follow the instructions. When you see the disk chooser, select your newly created disk. Select the Change option from below. Format it to ext4 and select mount point /. Press okay. Below, you'll see option for bootloader device. Click on it and choose the topmost option (It'll have some information about your HDD i.e. its size, manufacturer etc). Click continue when you are asked for swap partition option. If you do want to create a swap partition you'll have to create another partition. You won't need it in normal use anyway.\n\nA: Dual Boot Ubuntu 13.04 and Windows 7 - on YouTube\nhttp://youtu.be/xK8X7_tYWmA\nI found the video above to be very helpful.\nYou may also want to consider partitioning your hard drive as described below, which will allow you to access data files from both Windows and Ubuntu. I suggest using Windows Disk Manager to do this if you are more familiar with Windows. GParted, the disk management tool in Ubuntu, can also accomplish it -- but make sure the partition you create is NTFS format. (Windows can only use NTFS; Linux can \"see\" both Linux partitions and NTFS, but Windows can't)\nOne partition for Windows recovery and system files\nOne partition for Windows OS and related files\n(These are probably already in place since you have Windows installed)\nFrom the remaining space, create a partition you can use for storage of docs, pictures, videos, etc. If you format this in NTFS, both Win7 and Ubuntu will be able to access the files.\nThen go ahead and install Ubuntu. It will ask you whether you want to create a new partition in order to place Ubuntu into it. And it will create its own swap file if you choose the regular installation as opposed to the advanced. The video I linked above shows how to do the advanced installation, which is really pretty simple if you follow along carefully. \nGood luck and enjoy Ubuntu - my installation has been working very well so far. \n", "Q: Don't automatically open the folder of mounted devices I usually charge my phone through a USB connection.

I am trying to install Python2.7 for educational purposes in Ubuntu 12.10. Any help would be most appreciated.\n\nA: It is installed by default. You don't need to do anything extra to install it.\nPython is not an \"application\" so to speak. It's a language, and the Python 2.7 interpreter is installed by default. You can run it in the terminal to get an interactive shell for the interpreter. If you are waning to learn to program in Python, I'd recommend using the python3 interpreter instead, and starting from there, as new code really should be written in Python 3.x at this point.\nYou can run /usr/bin/python3 to get the default Python 3.x interpreter, or /usr/bin/python for the default Python 2.x interpreter.\n\nA: As @dobey said, its already installed on your box. Just open up a terminal by Ctrl+Alt+T and type python.\nYou might also want to try bpython.

Then select Try Ubuntu and check if your HDD has the Windows files or not and let me know.\n\nA: use GParted on ubunte like got to change the formate but do not formate it then got to recover disk that work for me but you will need 2 hard drive the one you want the stuff off and one to copy the stuff on cus i did the with my 3tb can got all my stuff back that should work but do not format it just keep it up in the back screen the just recover it \n\nA: You can just hope that you've messed up only your boot partition.\nI see two solutions here:\na) @Hrishi's idea is right so try that and if you are so lucky that your files are still sitting there further information are needed to understand how we can restore Windows boot loader or Grub to get your pc up and running again.\nb) If you want it fast and easy (this sounds good to me because you say that the pc is brand new and I can suppose that you have no important data on it) simply use your Dell Inspiron recovery (looks like you need to press control+f11 at boot, read here: http://en.kioskea.net/faq/7319-dell-inspiron-restore-to-factory-default-settings) and then start again with your perfectly working windows, ready to try ubuntu install again\nFor sure this is painful but it took me a nasty amount of formats to learn how to handle properly a dual boot.

Ubuntu mounted automagically two \"shares\", \"iPhone\" and \"Documents on iPhone\", and you can access your files there. If you setup iTunes on a Windows virtual machine, you can even sync your music!\nBUT... on version 13.04, Ubuntu mounts THREE iPhone \"shares\", the previous two and another one called \"Internal Storage\", which points to the DCIM photo directory. The thing is, after a while (~5min), everything is unmounted except this \"Internal Storage\". \nFor what I have been reading and testing, it seems like systemd is killing usbmuxd because it runs as root. The old SysV init didn't have a problem with that. If you run usbmuxd manually and as root (sudo) the thing works.\nAny one experiencing the same behaviour?\n\nA: On Ubuntu 13.04 what worked for me with an iPhone 4 and ios 7 is to use a USB3.0 jack.\nThe USB jacks on the front of a PC are typically 2.0, I could not connect using them.\n", "Q: In: No such command - trying to create a symlink and 'in' does not work I'm using a Ubuntu 12.10 server (an Amazon AWS EC2 Instance) and I need to create a symlink which needs the In command but this appears not to be installed. The message i get is In: No such command I've tried to man In but no joy there.  \nI've tried to apt-get install In but the package doesn't seem to exist either.  My main problem in trying to solve this issue is that googling around In doesn't really give you the correct results so i'm struggling to diagnose this.  \nIs In not installed commonly as a command by default, and if not does anyone know how to get it?\nMany thanks\n\nA: I see the post header says 'in'. The command name is LN (in lowercase of course). The program is probably contained in some core package like binutils, coreutils like that. You can also try if the sln command is present (it probably won't be there but it's worth a shot). It is the static-linked version of ln.\n\nA: I am quite sure  you need to use a l as in Lion or Leapord. instead of I\nOften times some fonts make the versions of l and I look the same, It is even hard to tell in your post without copying/pasting that you are using \"I\", now edited using code formating it is easier to read. \nThis is also an important reason to use a monospaced \"typewriter\" font whenever code is used.

I'm would like to know if all the programs made for Ubuntu PC would work on tablet with Ubuntu?\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: Yes and no.\nI don't know what you mean by tablet but probably your Tablet would have an Arm processor so its repository will likely be the same of Ubuntu Arm (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM).\nAs you can see on their page they say \"Much of the application porting is complete\" so probably you can expect to run a lot of the software you love and use on your Intel (or AMD) desktop.\nOf course if your program hasn't been ported for ARM it won't be so easy to see it running on your tablet.\nFrom Ubuntu's site:\nUbuntu on ARM\nUbuntu on ARM provides a platform for the best collection of open-source applications and proprietary applications available on ARM. Core applications include Firefox 3.5, Chromium, Evolution email client, the Rhythmbox media player and OpenOffice.org. Highlights of the ARM distribution include DeviceTree support and ARM v7 Thumb2 optimisations and removal of unused packages, creating an optimised desktop. Ubuntu on ARM is available to OEMs with the Ubuntu Desktop or Ubuntu Netbook user experience, providing OEMs flexibility to choose the user experience that best meets the needs of their target markets.\nHere's a document too\n\nA: Some might work but if you think about it how do you right click on a tablet? How do you hover a mouse on a tablet? Even if they did they wouldnt be very functional as the two interfaces are very different. \nCommand line commands should be ok, but full programs without a lot of rework, no. \nUnless you plug a keyboard and mouse into the tablet.

Ubuntu one is, but there is no Drop Box. Now I have two indicators. One for Ubuntu One and one for Drop Box. Is there a way to have just one? If not, is it going to be possible in the future?\n\nA: Because the upstream DropBox code has not been changed to support the new sync indicator. Or, if it has already, you are running an older version and need to upgrade to the newer version which does.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu 12.04 VM on Windows 7 I'm trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 as a VM guest, Windows 7 host (tried installing Ubuntu 13 before that, as a guest as well, but got the same problem) on VMware.

Could anyone tell me what to type afterwards?\n\nA: You're typing\napt=get install\nInstead of \napt-get install\nThe first one sets an environment variable called apt to the value get, and then runs the install program, which is a much lower level utility used when compiling your own software (which most people do not do).\nThe second one runs the utility apt-get, which is a command line interface to the package manager.\n\nAnd for su ; su elevates you to the super user, but you need to know the super user's password... alas, on Ubuntu, root (the super user) has no password. This is what sudo is for - sudo lets you pretend to be the super user, and needs your password, not the password for root.\nHappily, you can run su while pretending to be the super user...\nsudo su\nAnd feed it your user password, not the password for root.\n\nA: Well to get started, just type startx at the prompt, and that should do it.\nstartx will start the GUI that will allow you running a single session of the X Window System.\n", "Q: How to improve performance of VirtualBox when UNITY_LOW_GFX_MODE is not working? I set export UNITY_LOW_GFX_MODE=1 in my ~/.xprofile and it no longer has any effect in 13.04. Is there a way to disable all the eye candy? I'm running in VirtualBox and the Unity 3D mode with all the visual effects is overwhelming for the VM. Unity works and is usable, it's just very slow to render, so I'd rather have it off (is this 2D mode?).\n\nA: Especially on a low end machine such as mine (Athlon dual core, GForce 210) running Ubuntu with Unity and Compiz enabled is quite a challenge and may result in a rather slow and sluggish experience.\nVirtual machine settings\nTo improve this I gave the following settings to the virtual machine:\n\n*\n\n*enable VT-x/AMD-V, Nested Paging\n\n\n*2 CPU (from dual core host) with an execution cap at 90% to ensure host operability\n\n\n*2048 Base Memory\n\n\n*256 MB Video Memory\n  VBoxManage modifyvm \"Name of VM\" --vram 256\n\n\n\n*3D Acceleration enabled\n\n\n*Guest Additions installed\nRemove desktop effects\nThen I observed a very slow animation for windows and menus. This animations did more harm than use in my virtual machine. Below is three methods how to disable them to get a smoother experience in Virtual Box:\nDisable animations with Unity Tweak Tool or Gnome Tweak Tool\nWith both tools we can disable desktop animations:\n\nGNOME tweak tool\n\nUnity tweak tool\nCompiz Config Settings Manager\nAs this is a virtual machine with the option to make a snapshot before you do harmful things to your OS you may probably safely runs ccsm to disable Compiz effects:\n\n\nDo not disable windows decoration above\n\nDconf Editor\nLastly here is how to do it with dconf-editor:\n\n*\n\n*Browse to org.compiz.profiles.default.core and remove the following from active profiles:\n  'animations' 'fade'\n\n\n\n*Browse to org.compiz.profiles.unity.core and remove the following from active profiles:\n  'animations'\n\nUnfortunately I have found no way to disable the Dash animation, which still will be rather slow.\nGNOME Session Flashback\nIn the likely case you are still not happy with the overall speed of the desktop you may consider installing the GNOME Session Flashback, which will let you log into  GNOME Flashback (Compiz or Metacity) with a lean and fast desktop reminiscent of 10.04, but with all the upgraded applications, and the recent kernel:\n\n\nLogin 16.04\n\nLogin > 17.10\n\n\nA: The Unity interface in my Ubuntu 14.04 guest OS became very sluggish recently, even though my Guest Additions were up-to-date with the VBox version at 4.3.26.  I read through this and several other answer pages and contemplated switching from Unity to Gnome and other changes, but I knew nothing significant had changed and I remembered getting perfectly good performance out of Unity in my guest machine previously.\nSo on a guess, I simply reinstalled the Guest Additions (same process as installing them in the first place; the installer simply removes and reinstalls them) and I regained the excellent visual performance and eliminated the input lag that had been occurring just recently.  Try this before you try anything more drastic.\n", "Q: My internet connection turns off in 13.04 I connect to the internet via wifi for several minutes, and then it disconnects without telling me anything (the image of internet connections says I am still connected). I have to click in my wireless network to connect again for a small period of time.\nWhen I use another computer with Windows my internet never turns off. I believe I have used this computer with other wireless networks and the internet never shuts down. But also I have had the same problem with other wireless networks. \nI have to say that I do not have much experience with network connections. Thanks for the support Ubuntu community. \n\nA: I just posted a similar issue - see WiFi issues after upgrade to 13.04 from 12.10 - HP Envy dv6 quad core with rt2800pci... seems like a recurring issue with 13.04 with wifi...\n", "Q: Set mount options for removable devices on Kubuntu I share my computer in a multiseat configuration and would like everyone to mount removable devices with a umask of 0 (ie. readable and writeable by all and sundry).

But the permissions were wrong. It does not seem to be possible to change the permissions here---I think only udisks can.\nudev\nTried this rule and didn't manage to get the USB stick. However I'm pretty sure it's moot as this would be the permissions for the device and not the mountpoint and those are already adequate with a gid of disk.\nKERNEL==\"sd*[0-9]\", ATTR{removable}==\"1\", ENV{ID_BUS}==\"usb\", MODE=\"0000\"\n\nKDE Device Notifier + udisks\nudisks performs the mount operation for the KDE Device Notifier.

Device Notifier does not seem to have any setting for group or umask either.\nHowever, if one mounts it manually, things work fine. This does anyhow:\nudisks --mount /dev/sdf1 --mount-options umask=0\n\nudisks-glue\nA very promising tool, but no dice. udisks-glue lets your configure custom reactions to udisks events on dbus! It can automount devices and you can control the umask for that. Alas this has no effect on the mount options for the Device Notifier and there is no setting to override mount options generally.\nIt can trigger an event when udisks mounts something. So I thought I'd use it to remount the drive. Except it turns out that while it passes along most mount options just fine, udisks cannot handle remount.\n$ udisks --mount /dev/sdf1 --mount-options umask=0,remount\nMount failed: Mount option remount is not allowed\n\n\nAaaand I'm stumped. Any ideas? I'm on 12.10 still, maybe 13.04 has some magic for this?\n\nA: The ability to modify the allowed and default mount options is now available in udisks2 as of version 2.9.0.\nNote that you'll need to install a newer version of udisks2 on Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 to have access to this functionality.\nI wrote up a tutorial on how to install it from source on Ubuntu 18.04 here for anyone who is interested.\nThe official udisks2 documentation can be found here for how to configure default and allowed mount options.\nFor your particular use case, you could set the default vfat options to include umask=0 in /etc/udisks2/mount_options.conf as shown here.\n[defaults]\nvfat_defaults=uid=$UID,gid=$GID,shortname=mixed,utf8=1,showexec,flush,umask=0\n\n\nA: The best option I've found is udiskie.

Ideally I'd like to select the output device with PulseAudio Volume Control but get it to work at all. I've tried to set PULSE_SERVER to point to my server but I get playback errors.\nCan anyone tell me if my server configuration is right and how to configure the client (13.04)?\nUpdate\nI finally found out that I have to load the module module-zeroconf-discover on the client.

The other two entries look the same.\n\nA: The same here. \nBut in my case pulseaudio discovers a remote source, but not sink. However, there are typical error messages in log for both of them.\nAnother thing to mention is that fail message about module-tunnel-source is different from the one about module-tunnel-sink. \nThe second has server address argument written in IPv4 form (192.168.0.x) while the first mentions address in IPv6 form. Don't know why there is that difference, but it remains the whole time and somehow module-tunnel-source with an IPv6 address is loaded, but sink is not. \nMaybe it's just a bug and we should think how to file a bug report correctly.\nEDIT:\nI think I've already found solution:\nhttp://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/pulseaudio-bugs/2009-October/003348.html\nAccording to it you should disable IPv6 in avahi-daemon and restart it.

When I upgraded to Ubuntu 13.04 the file manager lost the ability to connect to windows shares as a specific user(from 'connect to server') from the file manager.  I could be connected to z share as one user and x share as another, but now connect to server offers no place to add credentials as it used to. When I try without credentials, I get an error that says \"UNABLE TO ACCESS LOCATION - FAILED TO MOUNT WINDOWS SHARE - PERMISSION DENIED\". I find screenshots where it's supposed to prompt me for a username and password, But I never get it. Just an error. Is there something that maybe carried over from the previous version? Should I delete ~/.nautilus? or something?\n\nA: If you open up your /etc/samba/smb.conf file you should see at the bottom the share definition. Generically it looks something like this:\n[share-name]\ncomment = \npath = /media/[some-name]\nread only = No\nguest ok = yes\n\nWhat you want to do is add a \"force user\" line to that share definition so that the remote user appears to be you:\n[share-name]\ncomment = \npath = /media/[some-name]\nread only = No\nforce user = [your-user-name]\nguest ok = yes\n\nThen restart samba:\nsudo service smbd restart\n\nOfficial sources: http://www.samba.org/samba/docs/man/manpages-3/smb.conf.5.html#FORCEUSER\n\nA: I think that developers have decided to simplify the way \"Connect to server\" work.\nWith most servers, you should be asked to enter your credentials when you try to access a share... But with some others, you first have to explicitly specify which user you want to use. In fact, in that case, you simply have to use a syntax similar to the one you would use under Windows.\nBasic syntax to use in \"Connect to server\" :\nsmb://UserNameToUseToConnect@SMBServerName/ShareName/\n\nExample :\nsmb://franck@myserver/myshare/\n\nUsing this syntax, one window letting you enter your domain name and password will appear.\nI hope that this will help you to solve your problem. If you still can't provide your domain name and password (no window/error message appears) or else, more information about the configuration of your server might be needed.\n\nA: This probably shouldn't be an answer because it's a bit speculative, but perhaps the lack of a prompt is another feature removal in the 3.6 version of Nautilus.

It seems to have data about icons but I can't figure out how it works.\n\nA: Ok, this requires getting creative! For this we are going to \"hack\" together a .desktop file that will then launch the folder, the .desktop file can have a icon that will be the same.\n\n\n*\n\n*In you Documents folder Create your folder but name it with a . so it will become \"hidden\" example .new\n\n*Find your icon example icon.png and put it in your folder also put a . in front ex .icon.png\n\n*Make a third file called foldername.desktop( How can I create launchers on my desktop? ) open it in a editing program like gedit and paste this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Link\nTerminal=false\nIcon=/home/mateo/Documents/.new/.icon.png\nName=Folder\nURL=file:///home/mateo/Documents/.new\n\nbut replace \"mateo\" with your user name for the icon and folder paths, and \"Folder\" with your folder name.\n\n*Make the foldername.desktop file executable - How do I mark a file as executable via a GUI?\n\n*Now to copy the folder needs to be in the same place - but the launcher can move anywhere - don't forget that the \"real\" folder is hidden - you can view them -> view -> show hidden files. So now you can have a folder within a drive that will be viewed the same on two different Ubuntu computers.\n\n\n\nIt wasn't easy, and most people stick with letting the theme do the job ;)\n\nA: No, that is not possible. Other operating systems cannot read the custom icons set on a folder by Nautilus or other file managers in Ubuntu.

Problems with && concatenator. It stopped concatenating.\nI ran:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:igorgomes/ppa\nsudo aptitude update\n\nThe aptitude update command began generating a screen output error (that I didn't remember to record) and since then the sequence sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude upgrade stopped working. In concrete the first command executed but the second didn't.\nI could fix it by removing the appropriate files on the folder \"/etc/apt/sources.list.d\" so the aptitude update command is working fine again, and so, the sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude upgradecombination` is working againt too.\nThe problem has been solved but I'm really curious ¿why did it happen? It's not the first time the concatenator && stops working to me and I never found out what's the logic behind it. ¿Did it happen to anybody that could find out the reason?\nThank you in advance\npulchras\n\nA: I just got to the right answer when learning on a different matter, so I'll answer myself.\nThe && implies that the second command runs only if the first is executed successfully. If the first command throws an error (that means exit 1) the concatenator doesn't pass action to the next command in the sequence.\nKeep in mind that it doesn't matter if you see the error on the screen output (foreground) or you can't see through screen output (background). When it's the second situacion, the error is being thrown against the shell interpreter even if you are not noticing it.\nTo check if a command gives an error back. Just execute that command alone, and after that, execute echo $? . If it returns 1, the command is failing and you have to find out what is going wrong on the command and fix it.\nIt is possible to execute sudo aptitude update; sudo aptitude upgrade to avoid having the mentioned problem, but for any curious guy out there, you will know what's happening.\nIf you want more information on what exit of a command means, you can check pages like:\nhttp://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exit-status.html\n(there are tons of explanations on this, so no excuses for not googling if not satisfied)\nAnyway, thank you guys!\nYou gave quite valuable help :)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04: Set Terminator as default terminal emulator with nautilus \"open terminal\" I have upgraded to Ubuntu 13.04 a few days ago.\nWith Ubuntu 12.10 I had set the default terminal with:\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.default-applications.terminal exec /usr/bin/terminator\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.default-applications.terminal exec-arg \"-x\"\n\nI had set it with sudo update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator too. \nBut none of these options work on Ubuntu 13.04.\nHow can I set Terminator as default terminal emulator with nautilus \"open terminal\"?\nThis isn't a duplicate. As I've said: the solutions in How can I set default terminal used in Unity? doesn't work on Ubuntu 13.04 with nautilus \"open terminal\".\nMy question is: \"Set Terminator as default terminal emulator WITH NAUTILUS \"OPEN TERMINAL\" on Ubuntu 13.04\"\n\nA: Here's how to add an 'Open in Terminator' option:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install 'Nautilus-Actions Configuration Tool'\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-actions\n\n\n*In 'Nautilus-Actions Configuration Tool', add a new rule with the following (as a guidance):\n\n\n*\n\n*In the Actions tab, tick both boxes and select an appropriate name (e.g. Open in Terminator):\n\n\n*In the Command tab, set:\n\n\n*\n\n*Path: terminator\n\n*Parameters: --working-directory=%f\n\n\n\n\n*In the Mimetypes tab, set:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mimetype filter: inode/directory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to File > Save to save the rule and you're all set.\n\n\n*I recommend that you also change the preferences in Nautious-Actions Configuration Tool to get rid of the two level context menu by unticking the following in Edit > Preferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*(untick) Create a root 'Nautilus-Actions' menu\n\n*(untick) Add an 'About Nautious-Actions'  item in the Nautilus context menus\n\n\n\n\n*Log out and Log in again.\nNow you're all set and should see a 'Open in Terminator' option if you right-click in Nautilus.\n\nA: sudo apt-get install terminator && sudo apt-get remove gnome-terminal && sudo ln /usr/bin/terminator /usr/bin/gnome-terminal\n\n\nA: This is also a bit of a 'hack', but it's less painful than the one provided by Germano, and allows you to still use gnome-terminal if you need to by referring to it with a full pathname (i.e. /usr/bin/gnome-terminal instead of just gnome-terminal).\nMake sure your ~/.bashrc file contains the following somewhere in it:\nif [ -d ~/bin ]; then\n    export PATH=~/bin:$PATH\nfi\n\nThen run the following in a shell:\nmkdir -p ~/bin\nln -s /usr/bin/terminator ~/bin/gnome-terminal\n\nFinally, log-out, and back in to your Ubuntu account.\n\nA: EDIT: Just saw this meaning it maybe does not work with 13.04 after all. Still, it is something I would try (I'm on 12.04 LTS btw): \nSetting nautilus-open-terminal to launch Terminator rather than gnome-terminal\nOriginal Message:\nIt may be too late, but since I was looking for a solution to the same thing but for konsole... \nIf you install dconf-editor you can (very similar to the gsettings commands) set the terminal you want to have opened by opening dconf-editor and setting:\norg->gnome->desktop->applications->terminal->exec = terminator\norg->gnome->desktop->applications->terminal->exec-arg = -x\n\nAfterwards you can quit and re-initialise nautilus with nautilus -q (may take two executions for the following to appear)\n$ /usr/bin/nautilus -q\nInitializing nautilus-gdu extension\nInitializing nautilus-open-terminal extension\nShutting down nautilus-open-terminal extension\nShutting down nautilus-gdu extension\n\nIt's also now possible to debug nautilus from the command line with:\n$ /usr/bin/nautilus\nInitializing nautilus-gdu extension\nInitializing nautilus-open-terminal extension\n...\n...\n\nAny problems when calling 'Open in Terminal' will be logged here. \nNOTE: this was only possible directly after calling with the -q flag. Otherwise calling nautilus simply opens the application and returns to the shell without logging. \nMy problem, if it interests anyone, was that the -x arg doesn't work with konsole, so I changed it to --new-tab -e because I didn't want a new Konsole window opening up everytime.\nHopes it helps someone. \n", "Q: How can i downgrade GCC 4.7.2? i want to downgrade GCC and G++ 4.7.2 to some older versions, 4.0 perhaps.

I am developing a qml-app and I want to put icons on the buttons. I would like to use ubuntu standard icons to get the real ubuntu look for my app. How can I do this?\n\nA: The official Ubuntu Touch icon theme is called Ubuntu Mobile, and is available for installation in the ubuntu-mobile-icons package. Here is a sample of the icons provided:\n\nTo use the icons in your code, just use the path to the icon. For example, to set the icon in a toolbar button, do something similar to this:\nToolbarButton {\n    text: i18n.tr(\"Refresh\")\n    iconSource: Qt.resolvedUrl(\"/usr/share/icons/ubuntu-mobile/actions/scalable/reload.svg\")\n}\n\nTo avoid having to repeat the root path over and over again, I usually use a small function called getIcon which returns the actual path to an icon:\nfunction getIcon(name) {\n    return Qt.resolvedUrl(\"/usr/share/icons/ubuntu-mobile/actions/scalable/\" + name + \".svg\")\n}\n\nThe previous example would then be:\nToolbarButton {\n    text: i18n.tr(\"Refresh\")\n    iconSource: getIcon(\"reload\")\n}\n\n\nA: I've only just started dabbling in QML, but it looks like the Ubuntu SDK provides a way to access icons from the theme, the Icon component. Here's a Hello Worldish example:\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 0.1\n\nMainView {\n    id: root\n    objectName: \"mainView\"\n\n    width: units.gu(50)\n    height: units.gu(75)\n\n    property real margins: units.gu(2)\n    property real buttonWidth: units.gu(9)\n\n    Page {\n        title: i18n.tr(\"Icons!\")\n\n    Column {\n\n        anchors {\n            fill: parent\n            margins: root.margins\n        }\n        spacing: units.gu(1)\n\n        Icon {\n            name: \"call-start\"\n            width: 48\n            height: 48\n         }\n\n        Icon {\n            name: \"call-stop\"\n            width: 48\n            height: 48\n         }\n\n        Icon {\n            name: \"find\"\n            width: 48\n            height: 48\n        }\n\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThis gives you:\n\nAFAICT, this doesn't actually seem to support the full set of icons provided by the Freedesktop Icon Theme Specification though.....\n\nA: The default theme for Ubuntu mobile is Suru and the icons are located in /usr/share/icons/suru\nAny of the icons can be used by name. Even icons outside the Suru icon set.\nIf the file is /usr/share/icons/suru/actions/scalable/like.svg\nThe code could be:\nAction {\n    id: likeAction\n    iconName: \"like\"    // the files name without file ending\n    text: \"I like this\"\n}\n\nWhich gives you an action button with a heart icon. \n", "Q: GeForce GT 750M graphics driver for Ubuntu 12.04 My computer has an NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M graphics card.

I suspected it might have something to do with the interaction of the motherboard with the graphics card, but i couldn't understand why the issue would pop up under Gnome and Unity, but not Xfce. It might have something to do with the drivers or perhaps the strain on the system. Either way, replacing the motherboard completely resolved the issue.\n\nA: Was it a Toshiba laptop?   I have a random shutdown problem due to CPU overheating.  XFCE likely uses less processing power than gnome, so CPU not always running flat out.  I fixed it (under unity) by changing the processor mode to \"ondemand\"\n", "Q: Manual LVM encryption setup with Ubuntu 13.04 I am trying hard to get ubiquity works. The thing is that I want to setup Ubuntu 13.04 on a full encrypted LVM aside a Windows installation. So I can't use the default option of full disk encryption.\nThe issue is when I try to use a partition as physical encryption volume I always get an error concerning keyfile.\nAnd if I make the partition before launching ubiquity, then I get an error when I try to make the mapping between logical volumes and mount points.\nThis was working great with alternate CD (or USB) but since they shutdown this Ubuntu image, I'm stuck.\nMaybe it is time to look for another Linux distro or maybe someone has a solution...\n\nA: Use the server CD image.\nYou'll get a full fledged advanced installer like the alternate installer, but it won't install any GUI. Install it afterwards using an APT task. E.g. for regular Ubuntu:\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^\n\nor KDE/Kubuntu:\nsudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop^\n\n(the caret is not a typo). Ubuntu is just a set of packages and while the several flavours install different packages by default, you can just change that.\nEver since 12.04 the separate server flavour of the kernel has been dropped and merged with the desktop flavour, so you don't have to deal with that.\nHere's the bug report for implementing manual LVM partitioning in combination with encryption in the desktop installer: [FFe] [UIFe] Manual Partitioning Crypt  and a blueprint: Improving support for LVM & LUKS encryption within Ubiquity.\n\nA: I just had success with instructions from here:https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedFilesystemsViaUbiquity\nBasically, you will have to set up your LUKS container and the volumes within the container using command line (cryptsetup, pvcreate, vgcreate, lvcreate), before starting the installer. Then in the installer choose manual partitioning and point it to the LVs you created. The LUKS container needs to be open (cryptsetup luksOpen) during the installation for the installer to see inside it. After the installer finishes, you need to manually add the LUKS container to /etc/crypttab so that the newly installed system knows about it and prompts for password at boot.\nRemember that you need to have a /boot partition outside the LUKS container.\nIt's not pretty, but at least it's possible to do.\nNot recommended if this is your first time using cryptsetup and LVM command line tools (or at least, back up any data you want to keep before trying this).\n\nA: It is time then to move on then.\nUbuntu installer is broken now. They used Debian installer in the past (up to 12.04) for advanced setups, but now you only have the \"unified\" installer, made by Canonical, which is simply broken when it comes to encrypted LVM installations. I've tried using my old encrypted LVM volumes, entered passphrase and it simply reformatted them into ext4 partitions without any warning, wiping all my data. There were no option to use encrypted volumes as LVM PVs at all either.\nMy advice is just to stay away from Ubuntu if you're past oversimplified setups. Both Fedora 18 and Debian 7 do what you want just fine. Debian 7 is being released this weekend, btw.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install the same applications on Ubuntu Touch and Ubuntu Desktop? I saw apps like Gimp running on Ubuntu Touch, but what about applications like Magic Draw? \n\nA: Most desktop applications won't run on Ubuntu Touch.

Looking at the release page, I noticed the short life of 13.04. It is only 8 months : April 2013 to January 2014.\nWhy is the life of 13.04 so short?\n\nA: Canonical switched to a 9 month support plan for non LTS releases because back-porting bugs and package upgrades was consuming too much time for the company, since most users of non-LTS releases upgrade each cycle.\nSource: Too much time wasted reading about Linux.\n\nA: After further browsing, I found this :\n\nUbuntu 13.04 will only be supported for 9 months. Previous non-LTS releases were supported for 18 months. For more information, please read the announcements here or here. \n\nThe first link tells :\n\nThe rationale here is that it’s costing a lot of time to maintain all those releases for 18 months. It’s also causing a lot of load on the SRU team and on developers to ensure that upgrading from one release to the other won’t cause regressions due to fixes being SRUed only to a few releases.\n\n", "Q: How can I clean my software caches from the command line? In the upgrade from 12.10 to 13.04 I lost the ability to use Ubuntu Tweak's Janitor to clean caches so I would like to know how to do it from the command line.\n\nA: I've never used any such software but if you're talking about caches, I think you might mean downloaded APT packages in /var/cache/apt/archives which are cleaned with sudo apt-get clean.\nIf you mean package/source package caches, then these can be re-generated with apt-cache gencaches. If you want to remove them for some (odd) reason, they're held in:\n/var/cache/apt/pkgcache.bin\n/var/cache/apt/srcpkgcache.bin\n\n\nA: Install BleachBit.

I tried to use gwibber instead of friends-app in my Ubuntu 13.04 system.\nI installed gwibber with\nsudo apt-get install gwibber\n\nThe installation went fine but I can't run Gwibber with command gwibber nor can I find Gwibber while searching dash.\nHow can I use Gwibber with Ubuntu 13.04?\n\nA: Ubuntu does not come with Gwibber any longer; the package named \"gwibber\" (and some additional packages like \"gwibber-service\" are so called \"transitional dummy packages\" to facilitate the switch to friends-app. If you look at the Gwibber project's pages on Launchpad, the newest packages there are about two years old, so it seems to me you're out of luck, sorry.\nOf course you can try to compile the old source code yourself, but I wouldn't recommend it. There probably are a lot of dependencies in that code that were satisfied on older systems but are not satisfied on current systems. So it would probably take a lot of work to get it to compile, without any guarantees that the resulting program will work in any decent manner.\nIf friends-app isn't your cup of tea, you might want to have a look at some other clients for your favorite social network that are out there. For Twitter, for example, there are Polly or Birdie, among others. They follow different concepts and are on different levels of stability/maturity, but are worth a look.\n\nA: I don't think you can install Gwibber in 13.04. I've unsuccessfully tried to install Gwibber some time back and found out that both Twitter's new API and OAuth standards are (obviously) not supported.\nMy suggestion is to go with the wave or if you're adventurous you can try Turpial or something else.\n\nA: Even if you install Gwibber, like you did, you will have friends-app. That's exactly the same thing happened to me on 13.04.\n", "Q: Is there a way to show progress when copying/moving files using the command line? sometimes with large files it takes a while and some sort of progress bar to know that its still working would be nice.\n\nA: rsync --progress $SRC $DEST can show you the percentage of what has been copied so far.\n\nA: Try -v after the command to do your command in verbose mode.\n", "Q: ntfsresize -b -f not working chkdsk /r freezing I've got a failing hard drive. Don't have the funds atm to buy a new hard drive. So I need to hold up. My main operating system is now ubuntu which is able to run the hard drive fine without any problems.\nI have ext4, though for some files on the ntfs partition it runs into problems and may cause to freeze up. I've ran programs like HD Regenerator, but to fix my hard drive completely with that it would take over a week of non-stop running.\nIf I try to boot into windows safe mode it freezes up after 20 seconds, can still move the mouse, but nothing responds if I click. So I need to move my ntfs files onto a ext4 partition, I have not seen any corruption on ext4 even though I've been using as my primary for quite some time.\n425gb NTFS, 46gb ext4, 4gb linux swap file data is how it's arranged\nOn my hard drive I am just looking to recover the most important stuff like documents. Bunch of pdf's, djvu, odt close to 50gb worth of stuff. There's about 80gb worth of free ntfs space which I'm unable to use atm.\nBooting the windows 7 installation disk, running chkdsk /f checks out fine with no problems, with 112kb of bad sectors. chkdsk /r freezed at the 4th step at 17%.\nI need to run this because ntfsresize won't allow me to resize when running the force and force bad sector command.\nI set it to: sudo ntfsresize -f -b -s 345G /dev/sda2\nand get WARNING drive has found 29 bad sectors, must run chkdsk /f before continuing. Something like that, don't feel like booting back into a live cd to get the exact error.\nNow one thing I am considering if I cannot shrink this pesky ntfs is to run ntfsundelete as shown here. So my hard partitions would be arranged as so\next4 345gb ext4 74gb where I would recover the files from ntfs 46gb ext4 4gb swap file.\nI am concerned that the data might be spread evenly across the sectors for the entire ntfs partition which is why I am asking here first.\nHow do I shrink this pesky partition or would it be safe to create these two new ext4 partitions in gparted and proceed to run ntfsundelete?\n\nA: Messing around with recovery tools while booted from a failing drive is probably never going to work and the more you use that drive the higher the chances of losing all the data on it are.\nRunning partition resizing and editing can be risky at the best of times (if you lose power in the middle for instance) Doing so on a flaky drive is asking for trouble, which is why the tools won't run if they detect anything out of the ordinary.\nIf you really care about these files accept you need to buy a new hard drive. If you lost everything on the drive would you care or would you happily pay the cost of a drive to prevent this in hindsight? A new ~350GB drive is pretty cheap.\nIf you don't care much about the data, really can't replace the drive and insist on running it until the bitter end I suggest messing around with partitioning tools as little as possible. Forget about reclaiming free disk space from the broken partition, you are probably just lucky that your Ubuntu install is in an error free part of the drive (for now). \nAlso, forget about ntfsundelete, that works for deleted files on a working drive, not corrupted files in a broken partition.\nIf you value your data I suggest:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stop using the drive to run the system from!\n\n*Try and copy the files to another drive while booted from a recovery disk.\n\n*Otherwise, try and access them from another system. Have you tried installing the drive as a secondary disk in another windows system or connecting it via an external usb case?\n\n", "Q: After 13.04 Install: Unable to Enter Online Accounts In System Settings after an upgrade from 12.10 to 13.04 I am not longer able to add Online Accounts.

This is logical, and I will be using the 300gb drive I currently do--but my question is, is there any way to make that HDD the 'default' save-space for the OS?\nWhat I mean is that, I assume when I install Ubuntu on the SSD it will establish all the folders (docs, pics, videos, downloads &c&c) and will want to--by default--access these whenever I click into them.\nIs there a way to set that up on a separate drive and 'default' in to that, rather than the SSD?\nThanks!\n\nA: I made a guide for that, a full recording :)\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sPGEwqoXA0 also read the description\nyou probably don't want to make the /var/cache/apt/archives partition i did, doing it made my desktop boot slower\n\nA: Create the main partition / and swap on the SSD and /home on your HDD.\n", "Q: Where is update manager?

I checked the problem for these software:\n\n*\n\n*LibreOffice\n\n*Firefox\n\n*Rhythmbox\n\n*thunderbird\n\n*GNOME-Terminal\n\nOn the other hand there are three bars on maximized mode:\n\n*\n\n*GNOME Shell panel\n\n\n*Title-bar for software which contains - + x (minimise, maximise, close) buttons.\n\n\n*Software menu-bar\n\nNumber \"2\" is extra. Is a package missing?\n\n\nA: There's a much easier way than editing config files - simply add Pixel saver extension to get rid of the title bar and reclaim your screen space.\nIt has the added benefit that you still get maximise/minimise buttons but these are now stowed away in the top panel.\nI previously used Maximus but this seemed to break with gnome 3.8 - Maximus also use to give me issues with pop-up calendars for my bank but this extension play nicely with that too. \n\nA: Even though it sounds tempting to use a GNOME extension for this purpose, it seems to me like this is not the most elegant way. After all, it's a change to the window decorations, hence it should be covered by the window theme.\nHowever, changing the global Adwaita theme in /usr/share/themes isn't any better, because your package manager will overwrite changes with every update. Because of that, I used to have a copy of the Adwaita metacity theme with the necessary changes described in the above answers. Whenever there was an update to gnome-themes-standard I used to update my custom theme by applying a patch file (https://gist.github.com/ajashton/1258443) to the Adwaita metacity theme.\nBut patch would soon complain about changed line numbers (due to the updates by the GNOME devs). So I decided to write down the necessary changes in an XSLT script that would be almost completely resistant to future changes by the GNOME devs:\nhttps://gist.github.com/tuxor1337/74e76d3d153c67593454\n\nA: A quick and simple fix for this can be found on webupd8.\nTo test this quickly without much work, just launch:\ngnomesu gedit /usr/share/themes/Adwaita/metacity-1/metacity-theme-3.xml\n\nNow find this next line, Ctrl+f to search, you want to be sure it is the line that reads name=max:\nframe_geometry name=\"max\"\n\nchange that so it looks like this:\nframe_geometry name=\"max\" has_title=\"false\" \n\nNow restart the shell to view the changes, Alt+F2, type r, and Enter/Return.\nTo further customize this you should examine the above webupd8 article and make your changes carefully, or paste the entire contents of the frame_geometry style including everything between:\n<frame_geometry name=\"max\"...> ... </frame_geometry>\n\nAs you will see with the above edit, the entire title bar isn't gone, a small portion remains. But I did not make the other changes and the contents of that stylesheet differ between shell versions, read below for another change I tested. I am also running 3.8 though, so I went ahead and did some testing and I made one more change under frame_geometry=max I changed the following value from 8 to 0:\n<distance name=\"title_vertical_pad\" value=\"0\"/>\n\nYou'll notice the difference now, and there's still a bit of a shadow left over, but it actually looks pretty good to me.\n\nA: Just for update: current solution would be to install maximus extension. It's author already fixed it for Gnome 3.8 - there's a mini how-to in franz91's comment.\n\nA: Update from 2018:\npixel-saver is pretty much abandoned project, as mentioned here\nIt also has a lot of open issues, like this.\nBut fortunatelly, we can install no-title-bar which works great and seems more active.\n\nA: The previous extensions seams to be abandoned or no more compatible, I've found this extension https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4630/no-titlebar-when-maximized/ that do the job.\n\nA: For gnome shell <= 3.8 You can use Maximus, but it doesn't work on newer versions.\nFor new gnome versions there's Maximus 2 right from the gnome extensions directory.\n\nA: others already spoke about maximus, I will just put it differently (simpler):\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt install maximus it is currently version 0.4.14-3.\n\n*start it on terminal maximus & disown. (can close terminal now.)\n\n*add it at start-up applications for next boot.\n\n\nReviewing\n\nmaximus actually tries to maximize ALL windows it can, even windows that should never be maximized, and by having no command line options, we cant limit it to ONLY ALREADY MAXIMIZED windows (so that it would work its magick and ONLY remove the window title bar). So, I am disabling it now until I find something more fit to my needs.\n\nobs.: ubuntu 16.04 here  \nPS.: why am I using metacity on Ubuntu?\n\nmy monitor is broken and I use nomachine on an old notebook, as the performance for games and videos is better on a 2D window manager than in a 3D one (in case that extra info is useful to someone else).\n\n\nA: In reference to the answers by\n\n*\n\n*Robbie C suggesting the 'Pixel Saver' extension and\n\n*Alkis Mavridis suggesting the 'No Title Bar' extension,\n\nthe 'No Title Bar' extension (a more featureful fork of 'Pixel Saver'), is now seems abandoned too; with the last officially supported GNOME Shell version being 3.30. Thus 'No Title Bar' would probably not work properly in recent Ubuntu versions, e.g. Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa) which comes with GNOME Shell version 3.36.\nAn alternative extension (which is being maintained currently) for newer Ubuntu releases is No Title Bar - Forked by BebopxD.\n\nNo Title Bar removes the title bar from non-GTK applications and moves the window title and buttons to the top panel.\nTitlebars are also hidden for Wayland-native clients that don't use CSD. Some of the options may be incompatible with this.\n\n\nP.S.

If it didnt, you may have a defective disk, or your memory controller is malfunctioning (most likely not but its still a scenerio). check with the manufacturer of your computer (Dell, HP, PowerPC ect) and ask for specs concerning how much physical memory the system can handle. Basic run through, check your device ports and drivers (and if the HDD has a power supply, make sure its plugged in).\nreferences: I repair computer hardware and program software for over 8 years\nHope this helped you :)\n\nA: Run in terminal:\ndmesg\n\nthis will display the kernel messages, in my case I was having a problem with my hub:\nhub_port_status failed (err = -110)\n\nI connected directly and it worked like a charm.\nCheers!\n", "Q: “MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME not set” zekr quran ubuntu 13.04 ERROR I have installed zekr Quran study software in ubuntu 13.04, but it showes error\n\norg.eclipse.swt.SWTError: No more handles [Unknown Mozilla path (MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME not set)]  \n    at org.eclipse.swt.SWT.error(SWT.java:4387)\n    at org.eclipse.swt.browser.Mozilla.initMozilla(Mozilla.java:1939)\n    at org.eclipse.swt.browser.Mozilla.create(Mozilla.java:699)\n    at org.eclipse.swt.browser.Browser.(Browser.java:99)\n    at net.sf.zekr.ui.QuranForm.makeFrame(QuranForm.java:628)\n    at net.sf.zekr.ui.QuranForm.init(QuranForm.java:340)\n    at net.sf.zekr.ui.QuranForm.(QuranForm.java:319)\n    at net.sf.zekr.ZekrMain.startZekr(ZekrMain.java:51)\n    at net.sf.zekr.ZekrMain.main(ZekrMain.java:94)\n\nthen I executed the following commands\n\ntcsh  \nsetenv MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME /usr/lib/firefox  \nsetenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME}:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}`\n\nBut it showes error again  \nLD_LIBRARY_PATH: Undefined variable.\nNow what should I do?

After that I formated my USB but my USB's storage capacity reduced to 2 MB from 16 GB. How can I recover my USB size and install ubuntu.\n\nA: Since there is no working answer yet, I post this:\nThe problem is that the remaining space of your USB flash disk has become unallocated. To repair it, use diskpart (in windows):\n\n\n*\n\n*Open command line (cmd) and type diskpart. Allow the windows to run it.\n\n*type list disk, and find the number of your USB flash disk.\n\n*type select disk X, and type the number of the USB disk instead of X.It should say that disk X is now selected. \n\n*type clean.\n\n*type create partition primary. \n\n\nNow you should be able to use the flash disk as before. (You have to format it first)\n\nA: first of all open disk management.\nclick on removable disk or pen drive you choose.\nright click on it and see the total space (sum of allocated and unallocated space)\nif the size is less than total space then follow these step.\nopen cmd (in administrator mode)\ntype \"diskpart\"\npress enter\ntype \"list volume\"\npress enter\ntype \"select volume 6\"\n{select the removable disk option such as 1,2,3}\npress enter\ntype \"clean\"\npress enter\nthen exit cmd go to disk management.\nright click on removable disk(your pendrive volume)\nopen new voulume \nthen new partition wizard will start .\nthen click next until it is finished.\nnow see your pen drive capacity it is changed!!!!!!!\nthank you for reading this !!!!!!!!\nplease comment if it is helpful.\n\nA: Use the Disk Utility that comes with Ubuntu and check that the Flash Drive's partition is actually using the whole 16gb, it may be that during the USB Installer's usage it screwed up the partition tables...  To fix this you can remove any partitions inside the Disk Utility for that particular device and re-add them again ready for formatting properly...\n\nA: if you are on  windows 7 and dont have any linux, right click the my computer, then click Manage.\nther you can format the usb and your other disk drives.\n\nA: This is an old question, but here is a solution for Ubuntu since the only complete answer here is for Windows (on AskUbuntu...).\nThis CLI solution uses fdisk on Ubuntu 18.04. In this example, I am using a drive that has 64 GB total space, but displays only 512MB as available. \n\n\n*\n\n*Open up a terminal using Ctrl + Alt + t. Identify the USB drive using the command sudo fdisk -l. This will output all of your mounted disks and devices, with an individual entry looking something like:\n\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 57.8 GiB, 62058921984 bytes, 121208832 sectors\nUnits: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisklabel type: dos\nDisk identifier: 0xbbd6109c\n\nDevice     Boot Start     End Sectors  Size Id Type\n/dev/sda1  *     2048 1050623 1048576  512M  c W95 FAT32 (LBA)\n\n\n\n*Find your USB drive from the list based on the expected size in bytes. You will likely see two entries for your one USB drive like above: one for Disk (a portion of the drive which is accessible to you) and one for Device (the total space on the drive). In the original question, the Disk entry would show 2 MB of space, and Device would show 16 GB.\n\n\nWe can now reclaim this space so that all of it is accessible to you (instead of just the 2 MB in Disk).\n\n\n*Make a note of the Disk's name; in this example, this would be /dev/sda. NOTE: it is very important the identify the name for your drive correctly since we will be erasing the data on it -- you don't want to accidentally choose your hard drive and erase personal data!\n\n*Load the drive into fdisk with the command sudo fdisk /drive/name, replacing /drive/name with the name you from Step 3 (like /dev/sda). This will start up the fdisk CLI interface (not your normal terminal); you can show available commands by entering m.\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter p to confirm that this is the drive you found in Step 3. Enter d to delete the existing Device partition.\n\n*Enter n to create a new partition. Press enter for each option to get the defaults (one partition that is the max size of your USB drive). You can enter in other values, e.g. if you want more than one partition. Enter p again to check the new partition, which should be different than in Step 5.\n\n*Enter w to save these changes and return to the normal terminal.\n\n\n*Add a file system -- if you don't know about file systems but want to use this drive with both Ubuntu and Windows, a good choice is NTFS. Enter mkfs.ntfs -f /drive/name to format the drive. See below* for more info.\n\n*Mount the drive. A good walkthrough is here, but one quick way to do this is:\nsudo mkdir /media/your_drive\nsudo mount /drive/name /media/your_drive\n\nThe full space of your drive should now be accessible!\n\n*About file systems: NTFS is compatible with both Ubuntu and Windows, but there are better options such as ext4 (Linux), exFAT (Win), FAT32 (both), etc. that you can/should use if you don't need the drive for both Linux and Windows -- I defer discussion of file systems to other questions.\n", "Q: Grub Rescue Unknown Filesystem Error.

Thanks!\n\nA: You're looking at output redirection (Bash). 2 stands for 'stderr', the error output. By redirecting it to /dev/null, you're discarding it to oblivion. Regular output, 'stdout' or 1 is still shown (in your terminal by default), though.\nBasically, this is just silencing error output of the mv command.\nA snippet from the above link explains it more general:\nCOMMAND_OUTPUT >\n  # Redirect stdout to a file.\n  # Creates the file if not present, otherwise overwrites it.\n\n  ls -lR > dir-tree.list\n  # Creates a file containing a listing of the directory tree.\n[..]\n1>filename\n  # Redirect stdout to file \"filename.\"\n1>>filename\n  # Redirect and append stdout to file \"filename.\"\n2>filename\n  # Redirect stderr to file \"filename.\"\n2>>filename\n  # Redirect and append stderr to file \"filename.\"\n&>filename\n  # Redirect both stdout and stderr to file \"filename.\"\n\n\nA: Btw, sometimes you might want to prevent displaying on the screen but might want to capture it on a file.

I am new to Ubuntu. Please tell me how to install the latest version of Urban Terror. Step by step answer would be great.\n\nA: The standard solution is to add getdeb games repository and install the games from there. The problem is that the original getdeb repositories are bit unreliable as they often go down. Therefore better option is to add getdeb repository mirror that has all the same stuff and is more reliable.

I don't have every aspect of the Ubuntu installer memorized, so I'd need to experiment to figure out whether what you describe is normal; and if not, what the problem might be.\n\n*This sounds like sometimes you're booting the installer in EFI mode and sometimes in BIOS mode. Your original installation was almost certainly done in EFI mode, so I recommend sticking with that. You can check the boot mode by dropping to a shell and looking for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi; if it's present, you've booted in EFI mode, and if not you've probably booted in BIOS mode. If the installer tries to set up an EFI System Partition (ESP; what the Ubuntu installer confusingly calls an \"EFI boot partition,\" IIRC) then you've probably booted in EFI mode. If the installer wants to set up a BIOS Boot Partition, then you've probably booted in BIOS mode. You can usually control the boot mode via a firmware boot manager, but how to get into it and what options it shows vary greatly from one computer to another. Usually you activate it by pressing a function key early in the boot process (before any Linux boot manager appears).\n\n*In EFI mode, there should probably be no option about where to install GRUB, although this is one of the aspects of the installer that I haven't memorized. If there is an option for this in EFI mode, then it's either bad user interface design or it should ask about which of several ESPs to use, and your answer in either case probably doesn't matter. In BIOS mode, the MBR is probably the best choice, although as I say, I think you should be installing in EFI mode.\n\n*To install over an existing system, you need to identify your old root (/) partition as your new root partition, and tell the installer to erase the partition's existing contents. I don't recall the exact user interface details to do this. It will be a little bit easier to set up if you also tell it to mount the old /home partition at /home, but you must be very careful to tell it to not erase the contents (the installer might use the term \"format\" or \"reformat\" rather than \"erase\"). If you're replacing the existing system, you probably do want to erase /boot, if it's a separate partition, although failing to do so won't be fatal -- you might just end up with some non-functional items in your boot menu.\n\n*I'm not sure what you're saying here. If you're saying that the program is giving inconsistent data on the size of a single partition, then this could be a sign of a serious bug or hardware fault -- or it could be user error. (You might be intending to select one partition but instead select different ones by accident, for instance.)\n\n\nBe sure to back up your user data before a re-installation. Although this process usually goes smoothly if you're careful, it can go badly if you make a mistake, or occasionally if there's a bug in the installer.\n\nA: If u want to format the /root partition, boot from live CD and open gPartition editor and format the relevant drive. then try to install.

Right click in the icon and choose \"Preferences\". After changing the settings we should close and restart Nautilus to see the results. \n\nA: This behaviour was changed from remembering the view settings on a folder-by-folder basis to remembering the view settings on a window-by-window basis.

I think some users would rather when going to some folders to see a set of icons and for other folders to see a detailed list, depending on the contents of the folders.

If you use GNOME Shell, then the preferences are \"hidden\": Open an instance of nautilus and then click the \"Files\" window on the left in the system bar at the top. Then click \"Preferences\". You can set and save view preferences here in the \"Views\" tab.\n\nA: Sort settings are remembered on a per folder basis in Nautilus 3.18. View settings are not, they are instead remembered on a per window basis.

How do I make the script run automatically during boot?\n\nA: Place the script you want to run in the /etc/init.d directory and make the script executable.\nchmod 755 myscript\n\nOnce that is done create a symbolic link in the run level directory you would like to use, for example if you wanted to run a program in the graphical runlevel 2, the default runlevel for Ubuntu, you would place it in the /etc/rc2.d directory. You just cannot place it the directory, you must signify when it will run by indicating the startup with an “S” and the execution order is important. Place it after everything else that is in the directory by giving it a higher number.\nIf the last script to be run is rc.local and it is named S99rc.local then you need to add your script as S99myscript.\nln -s /etc/init.d/myscript /etc/rc3.d/S99myscript\n\nEach backward compatible /etc/rc*.d directory has symbolic links to the /etc/init.d/ directory.\n\nA: Include your Script file to /etc/init.d/\nwith Executable permission\nthen set different run level\n$ update-rc.d script-name default\n\nIt will put your script on boot startup.\n\nA: Create a text file like this in /etc/cron.d/:\nSHELL=/bin/sh\nPATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin\n\n@reboot   root    yourScriptPath\n\n(You should replace yourScriptPath with the path to the script you want to run.)\n\nA: Use a crontab option to make your script run after reboot,\nYou can do this by adding your command prefixed with the @reboot nonstandard predefined scheduling definition in cron.\nOpen crontab as the root user (you must use sudo here in order to edit your root's crontab instead of your user's crontab):\nsudo crontab -e\n\nThen, add a record to the bottom, containing your desired command to be run as root:\n@reboot path/to/your/executable/to/be/run/as/root \n\nThat will do what you want.\nNote that you can see your user's and root's crontab entries as follows:\ncrontab -l       # list your user crontab entries\nsudo crontab -l  # list root's crontab entries\n\nFor your command to run as root, it must be in your root's crontab.\n\nA: Include the command in /etc/rc.local.

On any desktop, open lxterminal (not maximized) and open leafpad (not maximized). Then, in lxterminal, run xprop | grep \"^_OB_APP\". Nothing happens but the mouse cursor is now a cross-hairs. Now, click anywhere within the leafpad window. Then look back in the terminal window.

You'll notice that the content in between these tags is commented out by the use of <!-- and -->.\nMove to the end of this section and just above the line that has </applications>, paste in the following (as an illustrative example):\n<application name=\"leafpad\" class=\"Leafpad\">\n<desktop>1</desktop>\n</application>\n\n<application name=\"chromium-browser\" class=\"Chromium-browser\">\n<desktop>2</desktop>\n</application>\n\n<application name=\"lxterminal\" class=\"Lxterminal\">\n<desktop>3</desktop>\n</application>\n\n<application name=\"evince\" class=\"Evince\">\n<desktop>4</desktop>\n</application>\n\n(Please note everything is case-sensitive. Use regular double quotes not smart quotes --- smart quotes may confuse the syntax highlighting in some editors.)\nSave and close lubuntu-rc.xml.

Why am I getting 404 errors here, and what can I do about it?\nI'd prefer to still use the mirrors setup, rather than hard-coding specific servers to get everything from, if it's possible.\nUpdate:\nThanks to helpful comments in the first couple of answers, I've been able to rule out both server maintenance and firewall issues - I have no problem getting other things from the same server, using the mirror protocol. The problem is that the sources aren't available on the mirror I'm pointed to. In other words, all the packages are there, so lines in sources.list that start with deb have no problems, but deb-src lines fail. \nI've also verified by opening e.g. http://giano.com.dist.unige.it/ubuntu/dists/raring/main/ in my browser. According to the error message, apt-get looks for a subdirectory of this diriectory called source, which doesn't exist. So the problem is not connecting to the server, but that the server doesn't have the resources I'm looking for.\nI assume it's up to the mirror to decide whether they want to provide the sources as well or just the packages, but I'm surprised that mirrors.ubuntu.com serves me a mirror that doesn't have what I ask for. I see three options, and I don't like either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hard-code the sources for deb-src resources to servers where I know they are available, i.e. sacrifice the mirror protocol in these instances.\n\n*Uncheck source pacakges in Software Sources, i.e. sacrifice downloading sources for the packages.\n\n*Ignore the error messages from apt-get and hope mirrors.ubuntu.com points me to a different server in the future.\n\n\nIs there a fourth option, that actually solves the problem? =)\n\nA: The mirrors protocol has choosen the nearest mirror server, which is http://giano.com.dist.unige.it/ubuntu/. But in this case, http://giano.com.dist.unige.it/ubuntu/ failed respond with a valid response.

Your problem might have got resolved. :)\nThis is what I got when I opened that URL from the browser.\n\nIf you see, there are two items which got last modified today. \n\nA: If it is only the deb-src packages that are failing, this is not a problem.  The deb-src only contain source code, so unless you are hacking the source code yourself you don't really need them (generally speaking.  There are occasional exceptions).  \nNevertheless, I've seen this happen when moving around to different networks for various reasons.  Try the following to see if they help:\n\n\n*\n\n*Clean the downloaded packages in case a mirror is failing due to version mismatch:  sudo apt-get clean.  This fixed the issue once, but it could have been a coincidence.  It's easy to try though.\n\n*Check that a firewall isn't blocking your outbound packets.  Normally apt uses outbound ports 80 (for HTTP) and 21 (for FTP).  If an egress firewall is blocking these, it could cause you problems.  I don't know exactly which port the miirrors protocol uses, but it needs to be allowed through the firewall as well.  There are a few different ways to figure out the ports.  Let me know if you need guidance.  Also ensure that a firewall isn't blocking inbound packets either.  This isn't usually a problem because most firewalls are stateful and they expect responses back to connections originating inside the network.\n\n*Check your proxy settings.  Usually setting the proxy to \"auto\" is sufficient, but sometimes it isn't.  Check with the network admin to see if you need special proxy settings.  Some proxies treat apt traffic differently than regular HTTP.\n\n\nA: I had this problem a well on Raspbian as a particular package was getting redirected to a mirror/archive hosted at pdx.edu.

Now 3 days later I still don't have X back alive. The upgrade did not reboot with Nvidia working. I have tried all types of things including downloading the 313.30 driver and installing it. \nAfter that I can boot to the X login - and log in - but the display is trying to run at 640x480 and there is no way to get to a terminal (or anything) - I just see the background. I can get to a terminal via ctrl-alt-f1 and log. However, I can't figure out how to get a proper Xconfig file structured to work. \nAny suggestions?\n\nA: You are a little troubled there.\nI stumbled on similar issues yesterday while trying to build a system with xubuntu 13.04, on a old box. It seams that the nvidia drivers dont get along with latest kernel and/or X.org. I'm even unable to install the proprietary drivers from nvidia page (it seams to look for the sources in the wrong place, or expect an outdated files structure).\nI have this one, with a GeForce4 MX 4000 working with nouveau driver, that is what installs by default. i decided to go on like this after several attempts to get some specific additional drivers working (and failing miserably). It mess up boot animation, and text console get weirdly small (it only uses like 2/3 of the actual screen), and give many glitches, but its kind of usable for me, as long as i will mainly access it remotely.\nI still hope that nvidia or the people of canonical shows up with a 13.04 nvidia-96 latest-version-of-kernel-and-X compatible driver (not sure if you need those, or another, less ancient).\nIn order to regain access to your system, y would go apt-get remove --purge nvidia* , and try to install nouveau. I bet it will give you some desktop at least. Many users are having similar issues. You can find a lot of other suggestions out there.\nGood luck!\n\nA: These steps may be generic enough to solve your problem. \nFirst, on a fresh install, don’t login to the graphic interface, but press Ctrl-Alt-F1 at the login prompt to get a text console login. Now issue the following commands:\nsudo su\n\napt-get update\napt-get install linux-headers-generic\napt-get dist-upgrade\n\nreboot\n\nAfter reboot, log in again (Ctrl-Alt-F1 to do so in text mode). Become root again.\nsudo su\n\napt-get install nvidia-current-updates\n\nAfter this has been installed, you will get a number of status messages saying you’re done and that the drivers are installed. You are not done. If you reboot now, your computer will boot back to a black screen and be effectively bricked. \nnvidia-xconfig\nreboot\n\nSauce:\nhttp://falkvinge.net/2013/02/15/how-to-install-nvidia-drivers-in-ubuntu-12-10-quantal/\n", "Q: Battery indicator missing for amd 64 raring I dont find the battery indicator for my amd 64 Toshiba Satellite.

It uses a more robust connector, longer\n  shielded cables, and stricter (but backward-compatible) electrical\n  standards. The protocol and logical signaling (link/transport layers\n  and above) are identical to internal SATA.\n\nIn other words, you would not tell the difference because there is none.\nOne might argue that you could have a controller with SATA 3 Gbit/s capability providing eSATA connectivity and a controller with SATA 6 Gbit/s capability only providing internal connectivity and therefore have a difference in transfer speeds. However as you stated in your question, you want to connect a HDD, which currently do not exceed SATA 3 Gbit/s transfer speeds like SSDs.\nIn the long run eSATA will be phased out and replaced by USB 3.0 (currently 5 Gbit/s transfer speed with 10 Gbit/s already planned). Therefore my advice would be to consider using USB 3.0 instead of eSATA, since USB 3.0 enclosures are backwards compatible to USB 2.0 and therefore more versatile.\n\nA: yeah it is nice idea, But it is always not possible with External hard drive because it do not hold the boot start-up paths boot entities for very time you connected to different systems. It is possible only when you use the external hard drive for one computer.

I'd appreciate any help. Thanks. Feel free to ask any clarifying questions. I used to use linux in 2006, but haven't used it since, so I am new to Ubuntu in its current iteration. \nEdit: After attempting to connect via the included GUI it gives me a passcode to type in on my wireless keyboard, which I proceed to do. It hangs for about 10-12 seconds, then says 'Logitech K760 failed to connect' Thanks for the response.\nEdit 2: Can confirm that the solution in this thread worked for me (http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2101785) I am now typing this with my wireless keyboard! :)\nEdit 3: While Edit 2's solution did work, I'd like to note that it only works if you keep your computer running at all times.

If anyone knows of any permanent solutions, I am all ears (or eyes in this case).\n\nA: Use the GUI to launch the configuration process, as normal.

Fehily's book \"Visual Quickstart SQL\".  \nI've tried a bunch of approaches, but have had no joy. Latest approach is: \n$ su postgres\nPassword: \npostgres@piglet:/etc$ createdb books\ncreatedb: could not connect to database postgres: could not connect to server: No such file or directory\nIs the server running locally and accepting\nconnections on Unix domain socket \"/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432\"?\npostgres@piglet:/etc$ \n\nI'm not sure if I'm hitting the wall on passwords or authorizations, or something else. I'd sure welcome some suggestions.\nThanks in advance!\n\nA: If PostgreSQL is running and listening on port 5432 according to netstat but when you run psql you get an error like:\npsql: could not connect to database postgres: could not connect to server: No such file or directory\nIs the server running locally and accepting\nconnections on Unix domain socket \"/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432\"?\n\nthen most likely the issue is that you're using the psql from an earlier version of PostgreSQL that's also installed on your system. This version is probably configured to use a different unix_socket_directory.\nThe best option is to set your PATH environment variable to point to the directory containing the correct psql, createdb, etc versions before the old ones.\nAlternately, you can use TCP/IP connections by explicitly specifying -h localhost, eg:\npsql -h localhost ...\n\n(and thus createdb -h localhost ...). This will result in you using old versions of the createdb, psql, etc commands, so it's better to just set your PATH. The same is true of using -h to set the unix socket path, which is somewhat of an advanced option.\nFix your PATH environment variable and all will be well. You can test this temporarily with something like the following, where you'd replace /usr/pgsql-9.2/bin with the bin directory under your PostgreSQL 9.2 installation:\nexport PATH=/usr/pgsql-9.2/bin:$PATH\npsql\n\nIf that works, you'll need to make the change permanent by editing /etc/environment, your .bash_profile, or other appropriate settings files.

Occasionally I've seen root get denied access to folders in a user's home (which to my understanding shouldn't happen, but I've seen it).\n\nA: This is definitely a permission error.

Then the instant I try to drag it again, it will one of three times (very roughly) maximize back up to full size. If this is something like the Home window, it will almost always accidentally lead to having that initial click n drag start dragging a folder on disk to some other folder.

I know it must have something to do with my Nvidia Gt540M Optimus with a Intel HD 3000.\nI have also heard of bumblebee, which can solve Nvidia/Optimus issues.\nSO I basically want to know how to put unity in 3d mode, and enable some sort of support for my Nvidia cards.\nI am only 14, and beginning on Ubuntu, after a disastrous trial on Mint 13, so I would enjoy some very clear instructions and answers :)\nMy specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Asus K53sv\n\n*CPU: Intel i5 2410m 2.3Ghz; Intel HD 3000 graphics\n\n*RAM: 4gb RAM\n\n*GPU: Nvidia Cuda GT540m @gb Optimus w/ Intel HD 3000\n\n*HDD: ATA Hitachi 640gb\n\n\nI don't know what motherboard I have..\n\n$ lshw -c display\n\nWARNING: you should run this program as super-user.\n*-display\ndescription: VGA compatible controller\nproduct: 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller\nvendor: Intel Corporation\nphysical id: 2\nbus info: pci@0000:00:02.0\nversion: 09\nwidth: 64 bits\nclock: 33MHz\ncapabilities: vga_controller bus_master cap_list rom\nconfiguration: driver=i915 latency=0\nresources: irq:44 memory:dd400000-dd7fffff memory:b0000000-bfffffff ioport:e000(size=64)\nWARNING: output may be incomplete or inaccurate, you should run this program as super-user.\n\n\nOk. I now seem to be in Unity3d (normal Unity). I did absolutely nothing. And I just noticed that I could open myunity without the error message saying I was in 2d mode.\nSo that's one problem ruled out! Thanks!\nNow the question would be: how to use Bumblebee to have Optimus support?\nBumblebee doesn't seem to have a graphical interface, so I'm sort of...lost. \nIs there a way to check that:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power consumption and performance goes up with optirun.\n\n*Power consumption and performance goes down after closing the application.\n\nA: I had the same problem with about the same hardware (GT520M instead). You need to install a graphics driver for the card. Installing bumblebee will let you use the Intel HD graphics by default (to save battery time) and the option to run applications with the Nvidia graphics card (using optirun). First, add the bumblebee repository and update:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen, you can either install the open-source driver (Nouveau):\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee\n\nOr, for the proprietary Nvidia driver:\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee-nvidia\n\nThen, reboot and unity 3d should be working. To launch applications using the nvidia card simply do:\noptirun <program name>\n\nYou can see the Ubuntu bumblebee page you more info. Hope this helps!\n\nA: I think unity 3d should be automatically enabled after installing the right drivers. There should be a program for this called restricted driver. Just search for drivers in the Dash.\n", "Q: Dim desktop, bring focus to active window I recently stumbled upon this article for applications that dim the background of your desktop, bringing focus to the active open window.\nOf course the applications are for Windows.

Unless you can use Compiz (which I know you won't want to ;), you'll be \"out of luck\". The best route would be to report a wishlist bug against your favourite Window manager and hope for something to come of it, or (yikes!) write the feature yourself (maybe as a Gnome Shell extension).\n", "Q: Why am I not getting \"main\" updates?

After making a new workspace and switching to it, I noticed Android dev tools no longer show up anywhere. In fact, File-New-project only shows \"General\" and \"CVS\" projects. I have ia32 libs, eclipse-jdt, but nothing shows up except in the Help-install new software, which says it's installed.\n\nA: I have had a lot of issues with the Eclipse that is in the Ubuntu repositories.  I've found it's much better to just dowload it and run it directly.  If you're doing Android, I highly recommend the Android SDK/ADT bundle.  It doesn't get much easier than that.  If you need Eclipse for other projects you can get it at their website.\n\nA: I ran Eclipse with sudo, updated and installed everything I needed, then ran sudo chown -R username:username ./workspacedirectory.

How can we fix this?\n\nA: This has happened me all the time since I started to use computers as daily basis. What is happening, most likely, is that your mouse (both) are getting old, the push button inside is getting weaker because of extensive use, ending in multiple clicks. \nAll you can do is getting a new mouse, in fact I'm about to get one because the same reason. \nEDIT: \nAs it is likely to be a hardware problem with the mouse itself.

I'm looking for something similar for music. I'm looking for something that is a command line utility that will put me very close to the metal of how playing music actually works. \nI've seen a lot of recommendations for command line based audio players, but I'm looking for something that a lot of people seem to not be looking for. I'm looking for something along the lines of write a shell script to make a playlist.\nAny good packages like this?\n\nA: There are few audio applications which do not make use of more basic audio application inherent to all Linux distributions including Ubuntu. Per default Ubuntu audio is based on ALSA with most of it's libraries and low level tools already installed:\n\n\n*\n\n*ALSA project\nHowever we can also install another sound sond subsystem like e.g. the\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Sound System (OSS).\n\n\nOn top of these we need a sound server to make further use of the basic sound system, e.g.:\n\n\n*\n\n*PulseAudio (default) - For desktop sound applications\n\n*Jack - Audio Connection System (optional) - For professional sound systems\n\n*Music Player Demon MPD (optional) - for networking applications\n\n\nMany sound applications make use of the gstreamer multimedia framework, wich can also be addressed directly, or in own applications.\nAfter we had a look at the different solutions we can see that the Ubuntu sound system can nicely be controlled and accessed via command line utilities, even for finer acpects of sound control. The amount of graphical load depends on the music player you are using, but it can all be done without any player at all.\nThis is especially true for playlist, which are simple text files that can be made with any editor.

I have the libreoffice-pdfimport package installed.\nThat is true with both LibreOffice 3.6 (part of Ubuntu 12.10) and with 4.0.2, from libreoffice ppa.\nThe same .pdf files open perfectly fine on both LibreOffice for Windows and LibreOffice for Mac (yes, I have three computers with all three OSes), but on Ubuntu 12.10, all pages are blank, so I can only conclude this is an issue with Ubuntu packaging, or something really weird prevents it from working under linux.\nHow can I import these kinds of .pdf into LibreOffice for editing?\n\nA: If you make sure the scan is 1 page per pdf, you can open en edit it with Gimp.\nAs long there is no text-recognition done by the scanning software, libre-office or open-office will never be able to do editing.\nA simple scan gives you a image (build up by pixels) => editable by gimp\nAfterwards it's possible to do text-recognition => editable by libre-office or open-office\nIt's also possible to make a vector drawing from the image => editable by inkscape\n\nA: In LibreOffice Writer windows go to:\nInsert -> Object -> OLE Object\nA popup window will appear.

I had newest version (3.2.1) installed, because I re-added ppa after upgrade and updated bumblebee.\nI did one stupid thing though: I removed ppa with ppa-purge and removed bumblebee. Then I added ppa and installed bumblebee again. And magically it started working (at least after reboot).

appreciated!\n\nA: I was getting this error while trying to compile the rtl8192cu driver under Linux 3.8.X:\nI have patched the osdep_service.h file.\nI have added this line:\n\nvoid daemonize(char *, char *);\n\njust before these lines:\n\ninline static void thread_enter(void *context)\n{\n#ifdef PLATFORM_LINUX\n    //struct net_device *pnetdev = (struct net_device *)context;\n    //daemonize(\"%s\", pnetdev->name);\n    daemonize(\"%s\", \"RTKTHREAD\");\n    allow_signal(SIGTERM);\n#endif\n}\n\nHope that helps.\nDavid\n\nA: I just got a D-Link DWA-131 manufactured on May 2013. I similarly see the the same  logs in dmesg that existed before the driver install:\n[188290.668104] usb 1-2.1.4: Product: 802.11n WLAN Adapter\n[188290.668107] usb 1-2.1.4: Manufacturer: Realtek\n[188290.668110] usb 1-2.1.4: SerialNumber: 00e04c000001\n\nI use the following kernel:\nLinux 3.8.0-19-generic #29-Ubuntu SMP Wed Apr 17 18:16:28 UTC 2013 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux.\nI fixed the problem with the instructions here: http://forum.manjaro.org/index.php?topic=3515.0\nbasically - \necho \"2001 330D\" | sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers/rtl8192cu/new_id\n\n\nA: The driver code from Realtek uses some functions (kernel_thread() and daemonize()) that have been removed from newer kernels. Fortunately, a helpful person on Github has ported the Realtek driver to the new APIs that accomplish the same thing in 3.8+ kernels.\nThe port is available at: https://github.com/dz0ny/rt8192cu\nTo install the ported driver (assuming you have git, build-essential and linux-headers-generic already), do:\ngit clone https://github.com/dz0ny/rt8192cu.git\ncd rt8192cu\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nThen, to unload the built-in driver that doesn't work (rtl8192cu) and load your new driver (8192cu):\nsudo modprobe -r rtl8192cu\nsudo modprobe 8192cu\n\nTo keep using your new driver instead of the built-in one, add this to the end of /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf:\nblacklist rtl8192cu\n\n\nA: That install script requires bash, not sh. That will solve your error messages like install.sh: 48: [: unexpected operator.\nHowever, I am also unable to compile this package on Ubuntu 13.04, and I think it's because the supplied kernel is too new for Realtek's sources.

If removing postrm script won't work, try to put empty bash script into this file and do package uninstall again.\n\nA: I found some information on this page that may help you with your problem.\nThe way it seems, you cannot remove opera through the terminal alone. It seems you may have to manually edit the status file within the /var/lib/dpkg directory.\nSo the first thing to do before trying out the next steps is to back up the file called status, like this.\nChange directories to dpkg:\n\ncd /var/lib/dpkg\n\nList the files to make sure the status file is within that directory by typing ls.\nIf you see a file called status, make a backup copy (I usually add \"_bak\" at the end of the file I want to backup) just for safety precautions. Now type in your terminal:\n\nmv status status_bak\n\nYou can use vim, gedit or nano to open the status file. I prefer gedit myself, but everyone has their own preferences.\nNow to edit the status file type the following in your terminal:\n\nsudo gedit /var/lib/dpkg/status \n\nA page should pop up showing different packages and information about each package.\n\nNext Locate the opera package within the list of packages and delete the whole block of information pertaining to opera then click on save.\n\nNow type the following in your terminal: \n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nThen type: \n\nsudo apt-get upgrade \n\nSee if you get any error messages after this.

There appear to be various different technologies available to use an SSD to act as a cache for HHDs. The ones I know of:\n\n\n*\n\n*dm-cache (by Redhat - in the 3.9 Kernel, so it should be in ubuntu 13.10)\n\n*Flashcache (developed and used by  facebook)\n\n*Bcache (developed and used by Google )\n\n*EnhanceIO (by STEC; based on Flashcache)\n\n\nAre there any noteworthy differences in the various implementations? \nWhich one is best for regular desktop PC use - to increase performance of usual programs such as web browsers or games?\n\nA: I really don’t know where to start, since all this is excellent information.  I will start with some info about SSD’s, then a description of all the different caching methods, and just go from there.  I hope that you\nAdvantages/Disadvantages\n\n\n*\n\n*Price: SSDs are somehow expensive\n\n*Maximum and Common Capacity: High capacity SSD’s are very rare and\nexpensive\n\n*Speed: This is where SSDs gets the edge\n\n*Durability: An SSD has no moving parts\n\n\nBest to have a hybrid system, to have the best of both worlds (capacity, reliability, speed, etc.)\n\nThe Linux 3.9 kernel (made available on April 28, 2013) introduces SSD\n  caching. The kernel's Device mapper now includes a cache target called\n  dm-cache that enables SSDs or other storage device to be used as a\n  cache for a hard drive. It essentially speeds up data writes and reads\n  as it allows the faster SSD to first cache data and then transfer it\n  to the slower hard drive.\n\nSource:Iwn\n\nFlashcache is a module originally written and released by\n  Facebook(Mohan Srinivasan, Paul Saab and Vadim Tkachenko) in April of\n  2010. It is a kernel module that allows Writethrough caching of a drive on another drive. This is most often used for caching a\n  rotational drive on a smaller solid-state drive for performance\n  reasons. This gives you the speed of an SSD and the size of a standard\n  rotational drive for recently cached files.  FlashCache is a general\n  purpose writeback block cache for Linux.\n\nSource:ArchLinux\n\nBcache is a Linux kernel block layer cache. It allows one or more fast\n  disk drives such as flash-based solid state drives (SSDs) to act as a\n  cache for one or more slower hard disk drives.\nHard drives are cheap and big, SSDs are fast but small and expensive.\n  Wouldn't it be nice if you could transparently get the advantages of\n  both? With Bcache, you can have your cake and eat it too.\nBcache patches for the Linux kernel allow one to use SSDs to cache\n  other block devices. It's analogous to L2Arc for ZFS, but Bcache also\n  does writeback caching (besides just write through caching), and it's\n  filesystem agnostic. It's designed to be switched on with a minimum of\n  effort, and to work well without configuration on any setup. By\n  default it won't cache sequential IO, just the random reads and writes\n  that SSDs excel at. It's meant to be suitable for desktops, servers,\n  high end storage arrays, and perhaps even embedded.\nThe design goal is to be just as fast as the SSD and cached device\n  (depending on cache hit vs. miss, and writethrough vs. writeback\n  writes) to within the margin of error. It's not quite there yet,\n  mostly for sequential reads. But testing has shown that it is\n  emphatically possible, and even in some cases to do better - primarily\n  random writes.\n\n Source:Bcache\nBcache  has a big disadvantage, and that it takes away memory from the system to implement the cache.\n\nEnhanceIO is a solution that runs beneath the application layer,\n  enabling applications to utilize the performance benefits of SSDs\n  without major IT infrastructure changes. An SSD cache can yield most\n  of the benefits of switching from HDDs to SSDs at a fraction of the\n  cost of an all-SSD system. A cached system typically operates on less\n  power than an HDD-based system of similar performance, and that\n  creates a side benefit by reducing cooling requirements. \nAn SSD cache can also extend the useful life of an existing system by\n  improving performance to meet growing demands through an incremental\n  investment, rather than through a wholesale upgrade/replacement of the\n  existing system.\nCaching also enables faster access to the data without the extra\n  storage administration overhead to acquire and install new disk\n  shelves, configuring new LUNs and migrating data to the new LUNs.\n  Caching is almost transparent and requires little if any downtime.\n  EnhanceIO is based upon Flashcache.\n\nSource:Stec-Inc\n\nbcache is the most worthless of all because it requires specially\n  prepared (formatted) data partition. This makes it difficult (if\n  possible) to attach cache to existing partition with data as one would\n  need 200% capacity and to perform long data-moving in order to\n  activate/deactivate caching.\nThe brilliance of EnhanceIO is that it doesn't need intermediate\n  device at all and can be attached to any block device on-the-fly even\n  when device is already mounted. Another super-cool thing is that you\n  can attach EnhanceIO cache not just to partition but to partitioned\n  block device to cache all its partitions at once. Just like flashcache\n  enchanceio modules are built with DKMS and can be used with older\n  kernels.\n\n Source: Debian\n\nDM Cache Advantages\nDM caches use a simplified architecture, which makes them adaptable\n  and easy to customize. Users can adjust the block size and the cache\n  capacity based on the amount of data it will have to handle or on the\n  value of the data. If a particular application needs to store a great\n  deal of data in sequence, users can configure the cache for that\n  purpose. If a user wants to record information in a database\n  simultaneously with the cache, that won't interfere with the cache's\n  operations.\nDM Cache Dis-Advantages\nOne drawback to using a DM cache is that the Linux operating system\n  has limited space for storing metadata. If the cache is large, and\n  includes lots of small blocks, that adds up to a lot of metadata for\n  the stored information. To solve this problem, the user must increase\n  the block size. Another possible problem is that, after a server\n  crash, the cache metadata may no longer match the cache contents,\n  though it is possible to restore the correct configuration eventually.\n\nSource: Complements of Fraser Sherman\nSo from the above information it’s clear that EnhanceIO is the way to go, but in my opinion since it’s based on Flashcache, I would go with flash cache.  But I will definitely try both of them before making a final decision.\n\nA: Feedback: I installed flashcache standard deb packages on Ubuntu about a year ago in write-back mode to cache /home (2TB) to a 50GB slice on a SSD.  It has performed wonderfully with no problems.  I have had a few X related \"hangs\" (ie not attributable to flashcache) and have used \"Ctrl-Alt-PrtScr REISUB\" a few times to recover with no problems and no corruption problems.\nI used flashcache because a) there were debs available and b) it did not require a backup and restore of /home.\n", "Q: Alternative to Gwibber with message indicator support On Ubuntu 13.04 it's impossibile to install Gwibber, you get Friends-app instead.

I am looking for instructions on how to install cedarview graphics drivers on Ubuntu 13.04 32bit.\nMy graphics hardware is a GMA3600 aka Power VR SGX545.\nEDIT: It seems that they are not in Raring yet, but only Precise:\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/it/precise-updates/cedarview-graphics-drivers\nEDIT2: they seem to be closed source.\n\nA: I am fairly sure this is impossible. The problem is that CedarView drivers are closed-source, outdated and Intel is no longer updating them. The driver supports 3.2 kernel only, and its DKMS module fails to compile under any newer kernel (including 13.04's kernel: 3.8).\nBecause the driver's source is closed, neither Canonical nor Ubuntu developers are capable of modyfing it to be compatible with newer kernels. Also there is no way you could patch it on your own by following some magic guide, for such patch will never exist as long as the driver's source is closed.\nSo what to do then?\nThere are several options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Convince Intel to open-source the driver. This way they would not need to manage it, as the Ubuntu community might hack on it to apply updates. However, I expect it's clear how difficult it may be to convince Intel to such move.\n\n*Convince Intel to update the driver to a newer kernel. This may be difficult too, considering the fact they gave so little love to this driver, and it is definitelly not of their interest anymore.\n\n*Use Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Precise Pangolin, 32bit. While 12.04 currently uses 3.5 kernel, you can install 3.2 manually. If you do, cedarview drivers should install correctly. Make sure not to use the -pae kernel, as is also not supported. Also, you need to use the 32bit system, as the driver does not support any other architecture.\n\n\nYeah, I am aware this all is utterly annoying, and super-silly. Please direct all your complains in this matter to Intel, as it is only them who is responsible for this absurd.  \n\nA: I think this guide is what you're looking for: http://ef.gy/ubuntu-cedarview-drivers\n\nA: Since CedarView can only be compiled under kernel 3.2, maybe we could try compile this kernel first on 13.04 then we compile cedardview \nFor me,the only drawback for 13.04 regarding the native graphic driver is that the screen rotation doesn't work, except that the resolution is perfect and everything else is good\nI'm using Linux Mint 15, Mate Edition\nUPD: It's not just about the kernel, but also xserver version.. cedarvew is not supporting new xserver versions according to:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cedarview-drm-drivers/+bug/1132584/comments/4\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cedarview-drm-drivers/+bug/1132584\n\nA: Since I cannot comment on the post of Rafal directly.

If I get into ubuntu via the ubuntu recovery console (network enabled option) I can log in but then see no Unity or decorated windows.\nWhen I upgraded from 12.04 to 12.10 I had to follow the instructions at http://www.ubuntuvibes.com/2012/10/how-to-install-amd-catalyst-legacy.html to use my display but these didn't work for 13.04 and I undid them.\nCan someone please help me fix this display issue so I can use 13.04? The Software Center says the open source driver xserver-xorg-video-radeon is installed so I don't know why that doesn't appear to be working.\n\nA: Makarewicz' PPA downgrades xorg to 1.12? I imagine it must downgrade a bunch of dependencies as well, and I'm sure it becomes more difficult with each Ubuntu release. Unixmen recommended installing a legacy Catalyst driver without downgrading xorg, though they also recommend Makarewicz' PPA. Something's not right here, but that lighter touch seems more likely to work as continued Ubuntu releases move farther away from no longer supported hardware. Unixmen's lighter touch can be found here. I don't have an affected Radeon card so I can't vouch for any of this.\n\nA: It should simply work with the distro version of the fglrx driver, the xserver-xorg-video-radeon driver provides 2D support only (leave it installed). If you can get a terminal, run sudo apt-get install fglrx. You will also need the kernel headers, if you don't have it already installed. Also check the output of the fglrxinfo command.\n", "Q: Multiple OS's, several drives, need a working boot manager Okay,  so I have several drives with various operating systems on various partitions.\nthe main drive is a 200GB sliced into a primary for Ubuntu a swap and some storage. the other drives 2x350GB are similarly chopped up, on the 200GB boot drive, it loads to a boot manager and lists ubuntu and two instances of win 7 (one from the 2nd drive and one on the 3rd drive).

To configure ibus to work with XCompose follow this answer.\nThen you can start using it with no additional movement, the system Compose file have already defined the combinations on both order.\nBut just in case if you'd want to add something more, you can create a ~/.XCompose file. You can also download a popular XCompose, like this one, and then edit to suit your needs, but watch out for dragons, i.e. the one I linked have the combination you want redefined to input a LATIN LETTER SMALL CAPITAL A. Also note: I don't know out of hands if there's a way to reload the file without logging out/logging in. ibus restart for some reason doesn't work, I reported a bug.\n", "Q: Unity won't run after update to 13.04 First of all, I'm pretty new in Ubuntu so I don't know everything.. But I'm willing to learn!\nToday I updated my ubuntu to 13.04. Everything seemed fine. I used my pc for an hour and shut it down. The next time I tried to boot it up, unity won't start.

However, when I install ubuntu 13.04 from DVD, it never prompts me as to which disk drive to install on.\nUnfortunately, something is failing at the very end, so I have no idea where ubuntu is trying to install, but I'd at least like to make sure it is installing to the completely unallocated disk drive.\n\nA: When you get the options on where to install Ubuntu you can chose between installing it alongside Windows, erasing the disk or something else.\nInstalling it alongside Windows will shrink your Windows partition and create a new one. If you already created one, that isn't detected. So what you want to chose is something else.\nJust follow the official instructions on this.\nIf you already picked the first option you might now have ended up with a Windows partition that is too small to boot. You can fix this by booting the Live-CD/USB to the desktop (\"just try Ubuntu, don't install\"). Now run gparted to view all your harddrives and partitions. Delete the Ubuntu partitions and resize the Windows partition to the maximum. While you're at it, you can also use gparted to easily create the partitions you need on your second drive (chose it in the top right) and then just select them in the Ubuntu installer.\nWhen manually installing Ubuntu on a second harddrive (/dev/sdb) you probably want the bootloader GRUB to be on the first harddrive (/dev/sda) so make sure your selection looks sound.\n\nA: I used to installing ubuntu in a separate drive using the installation process guide.  It is simple, easy if you follow the steps well, also I advice to install the grub on the same drive to prevent problems with my windows drive beside if you decide or accedently format your ubuntu drive you still have your. Windows drive untouched.\n", "Q: Desktop icons disappear when using wallpaper plugin When I enable wallpaper compiz plugin all icons disappear from desktop. How can I fix that?\n\nA: Unfortunately, this is not possible. To get desktop icons back you will have to disable the Compiz Wallpaper plugin and allow Nautilus/Files to draw your desktop. \nThe Compiz Wallpaper plugin can draw your background, which can allow you do do some cool stuff (like have a different background image for each workspace). But this conflicts with Nautilus' ability to draw the desktop, and only Nautilus can display desktop icons.\nFor more information, see the answers to this question. Apparently people have tried to make Nautilus draw a transparent desktop so you can see the images from the Compiz Wallpaper plugin behind the Nautilus icons, but those efforts have not yet been successful. \n\nA: Ubuntu 13.04\nI have tested it in Ubuntu 13.04 and its working.\nsudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool \n\n\n\nI have also restarted the system and its working.\n\nA: You can try to use Ubuntu Tweak and go to Tweaks → Desktop icons to turn them on and select which you want to show.\nYou can download Ubuntu Tweak here, or add a PPA and install it with the following commands:\n sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa\n sudo apt-get update\n sudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\n\n", "Q: How to make a script passing his PID to another running script i have a script which is the main one and this script open a new terminal and execute another script so what i want is to pass the PID of the second script to the first script \nthe main script\n#!/bin/bash \n\ngnome-terminal -e \"/home/......./script.sh\"\n\nscript.sh\n#!/bin/bash \nPID= $$\n\ni want to pass the variable called PID to the main script \nREGARDS \n\nA: You can get print the PID by doing this \nthe main script\n#!/bin/bash \n\ngnome-terminal -e \"/home/......./script.sh\" &\nPID=$!\necho \"child_PID=\"$PID\n\nNote that you will may get the PID of the gnome-terminal and not the script itself.\nIf you want the PID of the /home/..../script.sh run it directly without gnome-terminal:\n#!/bin/bash \n\n/home/......./script.sh &\nPID=$!\necho \"child_PID=\"$PID\n\nA question: Do you really need to run the script through gnome-terminal?\nEDIT: The script.sh now runs in background ( with & ) and we're echoing the child PID.\n", "Q: how can I know which port am I connected to?

When I want to access the Disk to use the information, I can't get past this error: \nError mounting /dev/sda2 at /media/love/Mis Archiivos: Command-line `mount -t \"ntfs\" -o \"uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=1000,gid=1000,dmask=0077,fmask=0177\" \"/dev/sda2\" \"/media/love/Mis Archiivos\"' exited with non-zero exit status 14: \nThe disk contains an unclean file system (0, 0). \nMetadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount. \nFailed to mount '/dev/sda2': Operation not permitted\nThe NTFS partition is in an unsafe state. Please resume and shutdown \nWindows fully (no hibernation or fast restarting), or mount the volume \nread-only with the 'ro' mount option.\n\nClarification: I don't have 2 OSes. I only have Linux installed.\n\nA: The problem is that the disk is marked as \"unclean,\" meaning that it was not shut down properly and may contain errors. Unfortunately, there's no Linux utility to repair such problems on NTFS volumes. The ntfsfix utility recommended by shardival repairs only the most basic errors and then schedules a full repair by Windows the next time it's booted, so it's unlikely to help.\nAll this means that you must boot Windows to fix the problem. I realize you say you don't have Windows installed, so this means that you must either temporarily move the disk to a computer that does have Windows installed or use a Windows emergency repair disc. This site has such disc images, and I'm sure you can find them elsewhere, too.\nIn the long term, converting the NTFS partition to use a Linux filesystem is the best solution, but you can't do this until you repair the NTFS volume, or at least coax Linux into mounting it. Converting the partition to use a Linux filesystem will require backing up the files to another medium, unmounting the NTFS partition, creating a new Linux filesystem on the now-NTFS volume, re-mounting that partition, and copying the files back. I realize this is a hassle, but it will prevent a recurrence of the problem you've encountered, and give you better performance, too. (NTFS is slow on a Linux system compared to most Linux filesystems.)\n\nA: You could try this (worked for me with similar problem):\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo apt-get install ntfsprogs\n\n*sudo ntfsfix /dev/sdb2\nThat worked for me. Good luck! \n\nA: I have another idea.

Some file formats are not able to be opened, without both the beginning, and end, of the file in place, so the entire file must be downloaded, whether it is to /tmp/ or the location you wish to save it in.

This totally depends on the kind of documents you have. \nWhat I do when I get a new laptop and install Dropbox is plug it into an ethernet cable and let it sync (I have about 65GB to sync.) so I don't saturate my wireless connection.\nAfter that it really depends on the kind of files you place on your laptop while roaming. If you're just adding documents, PDFs, and so on then it'll just work transparently. If however you drop a 5 gig file on your laptop while you're in class or something then that will likely take a while. \nI wouldn't worry too much about saturating your college's network, most of them are run by competent administrators that will limit per-client throughput anyway, but for the sake of convenience when transferring large amount of files I tend to pause my syncing and do it later when I get onto a faster wired network. \n", "Q: No network interfaces detected when installing Ubuntu Server on Mac Mini I have a new Mac Mini (MacMini6,1 late 2012) that I would like to install Ubuntu Server 13.04 (ubuntu-13.04-server-amd64+mac.iso) on.

SysPeek is a system monitor indicator that displays CPU usage, memory usage, swap usage, disk usage and network traffic.\nIs there a version of Syspeek for Ubuntu 13.04? \n\nA: I would strongly suggest against using dpkg -i to directly install packages since this has the potential to leave your system with unresolved dependencies.\nInstead, I rebuilt the Oneiric package for Raring and copied it to my PPA:\n\nppa:george-edison55/george-edison  (Click here for instructions on using PPAs.)\n\nUnfortunately the Launchpad builders are extremely busy right now and it looks like the package won't be built for another four hours or so. Once it completes, however, you will be able to simply run:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:george-edison55/george-edison\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install syspeek\n\n\nA: To install, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

Some are old scripts and are there for backward compatibility and do nothing since they got turned to an upstart service. \nThen there are also ...\n/etc/xdg/autostart\n~/.config/autostart\n\nThese last 2 have .desktop files so the command they use is inside the file itself.\nIf you want them all into a text file you could do this, as a 1 liner, from command line:\nls -lR /etc/init/ >  /tmp/test.txt && \nls -lR /etc/init.d/ >> /tmp/test.txt && \nls -lR /etc/xdg/autostart >> /tmp/test.txt && \nls -lR ~/.config/autostart >> /tmp/test.txt\n\nThis would get you a recursively long list of all the contents in a file called test.txt inside /tmp/.

For some time now, I've been using virt-manager to manage my virtual machines. When I want to copy a file from the host to the vm, I have been using scp to copy via ssh over the network.

Advice please? I just bought a refurbished Samsung series 7 (NP700Z5C). I got a great deal on it from Best Buy so that's why I went with it. My intention all along has been to remove windows 8 completely and install Ubuntu, but now that my laptop has arrived and I've started to look in to the process more deeply I see that there are a lot of problems with this range of laptops firmware, particularly with respect to Linux (Is it safe to install Ubuntu 64 Bit 12.10 in EFI mode on Samsung series 7 WIndows 8 laptop?).\nSo my thought is that I'll install as a dual boot, reserving a small region of hard drive space for windows 8. I assume that once Samsung update the firmware the fix will be made available via an update through windows. If the laptop 'bricks' anytime in the next 90 days then I can return the laptop under it's warranty, and hopefully the fix will come before then. (an aside: I spoke to customer services at Best Buy, they said that they were unsure if installing Ubuntu would violate the warranty, and that I should call Samsung to check. Samsung told me that it would not, so long as I return the laptop to its original conditions before returning it. If the computer bricks then I wouldn't be able to do that, but then there's no way they could tell what I'd done with it anyway.)\nSo I wanted to ask advice from the larger community, because I'm new to Ubuntu and know very little about the internal workings of computers; firmware, bios, etc. Does my plan seem sensible, or have I missed something that's going to screw me over? Even though I got a good deal the money was a huge investment for me.\nMy second option is to return the laptop and get a System76 machine, but a similar spec machine will set me back half as much again as I paid for this Samsung. Perhaps people could suggest whether they think that would be worth it. I'd really like my new laptop to last the 6 years my last one did.\n\nA: Because your original plan was to install Ubuntu without Windows, the safest approach is to do that in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. I recommend:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Windows and create a set of emergency recovery discs, if it's got a program to do this; or create a complete backup of the hard disk using some other tool. This is so you can restore the system to its factory settings in the future, if you decide this is desirable.\n\n*Using a Linux live CD, launch GParted and tell it to create a fresh partition table. This will wipe out the GUID Partition Table (GPT) that's currently in use and replace it with an old-style Master Boot Record (MBR; aka \"msdos\") partition table.\n\n*Boot the Linux installer in BIOS mode. The details of how to do this depend on the firmware. You may need to enter the firmware setup utility to enable BIOS/CSM/legacy support or to disable EFI/UEFI support; or you may need to use the firmware's built-in boot manager to tell it explicitly to boot the installer in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode (usually by selecting a boot option for the medium that does not include the acronym \"EFI\" or \"UEFI\").\n\n*Verify that you've booted the installer in BIOS mode by dropping to a shell and looking for the directory /sys/firmware/efi. If it's not present, you've probably booted in BIOS mode. If that file is present, you should reboot and try again, since you've booted in EFI mode.\n\n*Install normally.\n\n\nThereafter, you've got a system that you can treat like a normal BIOS-based computer and not worry about the firmware's bricking bug, since that bug can be triggered only from an EFI-booted OS. Note that the bug can be triggered from Windows, so dual-booting with Windows in EFI mode poses at least some risk.\n\nA: I have a 700Z5C-S02UB (from BestBuy too).\nBoot windows first and make sure the BIOS is updated to the latest version.\nDisable fast boot and secure boot and the proceed with the installation. \nI kept the windows partition just in case.\nIf everything goes you should have Ubuntu running in no time.\nLater, you'll need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Bumblebee to use the nvidia card\n\n*Use this fix for high CPU usage.\n\n*Set this parameters to fix the sensitivity of the touchpad.   \n\n*IME, Keyboard backlight intensity can be controlled in windows, so when booting windows, set the backlight to the desired intensity... on/off based on ambient light works fine in Ubuntu\n\n*You can use flashcache to use the 8Gb SSD to boost disk performance.\n\n\nI'm probably forgetting something, but otherwise, is a fine machine... enjoy!\n", "Q: How to enable PHP on LAMPP?

You can also click on the gear icon on the top right of the window and click \"New Folder\".\n\n\nA: Now, in 18.04 (2018) there are these three horizontal lines in the top right corner. If you click on them there will be a small window and in it you will find a create new folder button. But still quite unbelievable to hide nifty things like this.\n \n\nA: As of mid 2017, with Nautilus 3.14.3 on Ubuntu 16.04, CTRL-SHIFT-N works, but so does going to the top menu and select File / New Folder.\nI do believe that a button should be made available for this simple function.\n", "Q: How to change screen resolution in Xubuntu 11.10?

Then in the configuration window choose the wine tab and select 'configure wine', which will launch the familiar winecfg. In that wine configuration menu, go to the graphics tab and choose 'emulate a virtual desktop' and select the resolution you require and apply the settings.\nVery often you can choose a windowed option in the game itself rather than using the wine virtual desktop.\nAll the menus and windows I refer to in the first paragraph above are shown in the screenshot below, where I show how to configure a virtual desktop for a playonlinux application.\n \nFor more information, please refer to the documentation at the official site, and if you wish to backup your game and its settings in the playonlinux wineprefix, see my answer here.\n", "Q: how to unite all files from several subfolders into one big folder? how can I copy all files, with different extensions, from several different subdirectories, into one main folder? \n\nA: If you're not wanting to keep the directory structure and just want to move all the files into one folder, you can do something like this.\nfind /src/folder/1 /src/folder/2 -type f -exec cp {} /path/to/destination/ \\;\n\nThis will find every file -type f from the given source folders, then execute the -exec command on them.  In this case, you want to copy cp them into the destination folder.\nKeep in mind, this will fully traverse the source folders recursively.  If you want to only go deep a certain level into the source directories, use the -maxdepth options on the find command.\nfind /src/folder/1 /src/folder/2 -type f -maxdepth 2 -exec cp {} /path/to/destination/ \\;\n\n\nA: find ./ -type f -exec cp '{}' ./ \\;\n\n", "Q: Sound problem while gaming on HP Pavilion DV4 I get a weird behavior with my volume every time I try to play a game with Desmume or even if I try to play Trine in Steam. \nVolume goes up and down and it doesn't stop which makes gaming impossible. \nAnyone has an idea to solve this?\nI have an HP Pavilion DV4 2161nr.\n\nA: I haven't tried any steam game on Ubuntu yet.

The default alx module in 13.04 for the AR8161 Ethernet card doesn't work for my Y580 and when I make my own from compat-drivers and install it, the webcam stops working. alx somehow screws with another module, uvcvideo, which is needed in order to access the camera feed. After I install alx myself, uvcvideo is no longer loaded at startup and I can't load it manually, if I try \"sudo modprobe uvcvideo\" I get something along the lines of 'uvcvideo' Invalid argument\nIt turns out that the makefile that was in the tar.gz I downloaded from a link included some other modules in the make sequence (videodev and something other from v4l2...) So, I didn't install just alx, I actually overwrote some other modules which were working just fine and in the end, it was the unintentionally built videodev that conflicted with uvcvideo, so I solved the problem by installing the 3.9 kernel and modifying the makefile so it would build only the alx module and everything went great :) Now I've got both a working Ethernet card and a working webcam.\n", "Q: NO SOUND!

I will be using multiple versions of Zend and Drupal, but this should make no difference as each project can contain it's own libraries without causing any issues with other projects.\nI am using Apache2 with mod_wsgi.\n\nA: It depends on how you want to deploy Django, what version you want to deploy, and how you want your website to work, there is no real answer for this. There are a lot of tutorials on how to deploy Django X.X.X on Apache2, follow the one that fits you the best.\nI did it using mod_wsgi. You can add a virtual host for the website or an WSGI allias on httpd.conf and /etc/apache2/sites-available/default.

I have another ubuntu (13.04) machine hooked to my television that I also use to play the movies.  I've noticed that when I open movies in VLC that are in the 300-400 MB range, it pauses a few seconds at startup, but generally plays fine after that.  But for movies greater than ~1GB, VLC does the same pause at startup except it never recovers.  Occasionally it will begin to play the first second or two, and then stop.

Previously (in 12.10) it used\nstart on (local-filesystems and net-device-up IFACE=eth0)\nin 13.04 this no longer works - I tried all variants you can think of eg, runlevels, IFACE=!lo etc.\nTo get it to work on 13.04, I changed back to the original start on, but used a script with a sleep 10 before the mount - this worked.\nHas something changed in 13.04 that affects this behaviour?\n\nA: First of all, it should be 'IFACE!=lo' and not 'IFACE=!lo', but I'll assume this is a typo in your question.\nThat said, I'm having the exact same problem, and even tried different machines running 13.04 and the problem was reproduced. But from what I have gathered, no, nothing changed in Upstart 1.8.\nI find that while 'net-device-up IFACE=*' does not work at all in the complex upstart job I wrote, it will work if I put it in simple job such as:\n# /etc/init/debug.conf\nstart on (local-filesystems and net-device-up IFACE!=lo)\nscript\n  exec 1>>/tmp/log.file\n  echo \"$0:$$:`date`: got called. Environment of job $JOB was:\"\n  env\n  echo\nend script\n\nSo, clearly there's something else going on here. I'm reading the /var/log/syslog and /var/log/kern.log logs but couldn't pick up a candidate for culprit yet.\nMy solution (to the other, complex job) was to leave out the interface and just write:\nstart on (local-filesystems and net-device-up)\n\nThis worked perfectly. However this is not good enough for me yet, since my script will be run on machines with multiple interfaces. I'll update this answer if I find a better solution than my workaround or yours. \n\nA: The appropriate way to mount a remote NFS at start up is to put it in /etc/fstab. \nserver:/export /mount/point nfs nobootwait,nfsvers=4\n\nThis line will mount '/export' from 'server' at boot time, but it will not hold up the boot process.

I'm thinking of purchasing a solid state drive for my computer, to install my operating systems on. It's my understanding that SSDs don't like being written to often, so I want to make sure that the drive isn't written to more than necessary.\n\nA: It's a non-issue. To wear out a 10,000 cycles 64 GB SSD, you'd have to write 10,000 times 64 GBs, that is, 64 GBs a day per 27 years. Way too much for an average user.\nIt was a problem when SSDs had less cycles and thus wore out early.\n", "Q: Blacklist.conf \"Ignoring Bad Line Boot Prompt\" \n\nAlright Ubuntu wizards, I jacked up my system a bit unnecessarily, which is now giving me the chance to learn more about how to fix it...a vicious cycle. Anyway, I have it mostly up and running again to my liking, though I am receiving this (photo attached) prompt when my system boots:\nlibkmod: ERROR ../libkmod/libkmod-config.c:686 kmod_config_parse: /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf line 56: ignoring bad line starting with 'rt2800usb'\n\nOther users had success with just deleting the bad line from their blacklist.conf file, which I have done. Line 56 no longer exists, but I'm still receiving the same error. So am I missing something? Is there some follow-up command I need to give Ubuntu after saving the conf file?\n\nA: Looks like it fixed itself...or it's because I deleted that bad line. It's probably because I deleted the bad line.\nHere is how I accessed the blacklist file:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the terminal\n\n*Type the command sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf to open the blacklist.conf file\n\n*Locate the bad line, delete it, and save the file\nIn my case, I stopped receiving the error after a few restarts. Don't know why it delayed.\n\nA: The copy of blacklist.conf consulted during boot, to produce that ignoring bad line error, is the one in the initial RAM filesystem.\n(That copy's fully qualified path is /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf, like the one you edited. But at the point during boot when it is consulted, / is the initial RAM filesystem rather than your regular root filesystem stored on disk.)\nThis explains why the problem was not fixed immediately when you edited the blacklist.conf stored in your regular root filesystem.\nThe initial RAM filesystem is (re)built under some circumstances, such as when a new kernel is installed and as a result of some driver installations and some configuration changes. I think such an event probably triggered your delayed fix.\nFor the benefit of others, and in case you have this problem again, you can run\nupdate-initramfs -k all -c\nto rebuild (-c) the initial RAM filesystem for all installed kernels (-k all). Each installed kernel has its own associated initramfs.\nCredit for this solution goes to Christian, who presented it as part of an answer to Ubuntu update caused system to freeze on boot at purple screen. Recovery mode fails and brings up BusyBox, which is a more complicated version of this problem. In that question, the bad blacklist.conf (or other factors) actually prevented the system from booting successfully, and it was necessary for the fix to be applied in a chroot. That was fortunately not necessary in this case.\nSince your problem went away by itself (here and there, too), I tested that solution to make sure it works. On an Ubuntu Server 14.10 Beta 2 system (as that's what I had handy for testing), I deliberately produced the problem by creating a bad line in my blacklist.conf file and running update-initramfs -k all -c. (As expected, just editing the file didn't produce the error on reboot--I had to rebuild the initial RAM filesystem to apply the changes.) Reverting to the original, correct blacklist.conf file did not immediately correct the problem, but did once I ran update-initramfs -k all -c again, as expected.\nAs a secondary matter, when editing /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf or other files that have to be edited as root, if you wish to use Gedit, I recommend running it as gksudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf, as running graphical programs as root with straight sudo sometimes creates root-owned configuration files in your home directory, interfering with the application's functioning when you run it normally later. If the gksu  package (which provides gksudo) isn't installed, you can use sudo -H or sudo -i instead.\n", "Q: Is it worth upgrading from 12.04 LTS to 13.04 I am running 12.04 LTS smoothly with all updates intact for over 8 months and didn't upgrade to 12.10. I recently learned from some where that If I need to upgrade to 13.04, I should upgrade to 12.10 first and then to 13.04. I was curious if it was worth taking the effort for the upgrade?\n\nA: You can always download 13.04 iso image and try the live environment and see if you like it. There is no objective answer I suppose. \nOf course you should certainly upgrade before the support ends and for 12.04 it means before April 2017. One reason to upgrade would be that as Ubuntu is coming to phones and tablets it must become more resource efficient. As people claim 13.04 delivers notable improvements in that sense. That means, it is likely to do the same tasks faster.\nOn the other hand, if your not an enthusiast who just enjoys new things and don't care if they don't work then it makes sense to wait before moving to new release. After first few months there is hope that most critical bugs have been revealed and fixed. \nI am using 12.04 myself and really wondering whether it is worth the trouble of upgrading to 13.04. Even if you use the release upgrade feature it makes sense to make backups as things might go wrong (as you can read from various questions here) and the whole process takes time and effort. So maybe wait for 14.04 and upgrade next summer. \nOn the other hand if your current system has any chronic problems you might want to try if those have been fixed in the newer release.\n\nEDIT: I upgraded to 13.04 and yes it is faster as everybody have been telling me.\n\nA: For me, 13.10 is working quite faster and a lot more stable then 12.10. But if your 12.04 is working good enough for you, I don't see reason to force upgrade. \nYou can check this site for info about what's new in 13.04. \n", "Q: Wired net not working after upgrading to ubuntu 13.04 Yesterday I upgraded to Ubuntu 13.04 from 12.10 on my DELL latitude D520 laptop, but then my cable internet stopped working.

I recommend you run a SMART test. In Linux, tools like the text-mode smartctl and the GUI GSmartControl can do this; or most disk manufacturers have tools to do these tests from Windows, if you've got a Windows installation on another disk. The SMART test will tell you if your disk is failing, although the results can be difficult to interpret, so you may need to ask for help.

I have enabled legacy boot and disabled secure boot in Bios settings. \nNB: I am new to Ubuntu and have minimal programming experience. \n\nA: This is the absolute normal behaviour you expect when dual-booting. Your computer will only be able to run a single operating system at the time.\nTherefore whenever you change your operating system from Windows to Ubuntu or vice versa you will have to reboot. The first boot device then has to be the drive where you had put the boot-loader Grub.

Once you get to the installation screen, choose Something else\n\nChoose the second Drive\n\nAfter you choose it, click on Create new partition table, and just follow the rest of the steps, as shown in the images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Edit:\nAs we discovered my answer is not that relevant if you use Wubi as it will do all the complicated work for you. But if somebody reading this plans to do it with grub instead then keep reading.\n\nThe problem with such setup is that it makes bootloader setup bit more difficult.\nNamely when you want to boot to XP then Windows requires to be on the first boot device. The problem is that grub (Linux bootloader that usually would provide the menu at boot where you can chose which OS you want to start) is installed on the second HD where Ubuntu is and if you boot to grub (that is, use the HD where Ubuntu is as the first boot drive) and chose Windows then it won't start.\n\nRemember that /dev/sda, /dev/sdb... are just names that the drives have in Linux. Windows knows nothing about it and neither does bios. Windows uses names such as C:, D: ..but neither does know Linux or bios about them. What matters here is boot order set in bios. For changing the boot order in bios there are lot of guides available and it is dependent on your hardware model.\n\nWhat you need to do is to set up XP bootloader to let you chose between Ubuntu and Windows.\nThere is a good guide for it here. I have not tested it myself but you should get general idea and what keywords to search for. In your case Ubuntu would be installed on a separate HD and in theory you should not be worried about overwriting Windows MBR. Of course it doesn't hurt to unplug Windows HD before you install Ubuntu just to make sure nothing funny happens during the installation.\n", "Q: mysql-client-core-5.5 : Breaks: mysql-client (< 5.5.31-0ubuntu0.12.04.1) the automatic security update broke my mysql installation and I don't understand how to fix it.

There seem to be some HDMI PCIe video capture cards around, but only some of them are stated to support Linux, and those are often stated to not support Video4Linux. So how to capture then? \nDoes anyone know a Video4Linux supporting device to capture HDMI?\n\nA: For anyone coming to this page from Google:\nFor EDITING video:\nTo capture HDMI content in Ubuntu, you can use HDMI capture USB boxes (such as Magewell XI100DUSB-HDMI) or HDMI PCI cards (such as Blackmagic Intensity Pro).\nAlso, you may need to use a Linux-centric video solution such as ShotCut if you want these cards to work well.\nFor LIVE STREAMING video:\nThe above-mentioned cards might work but will require gstreamer in-between to make the Intensity Pro's inputs available in V4L(2).\nAlso, please note that for any of this to work, your video has to come out in unprotected mode (non-HDCP), otherwise your capturing won't show any video/audio.\n\nA: I'd like to add another V4L2-compatible device to the list since this page is very popular on Google: the Avermedia LiveGamerPortable2.\nI tested it on Ubuntu 16.04 with OBS and works perfectly out of the box via USB in both its \"PC\" mode and \"external storage\" mode.\nAvermedia doesn't officially support Linux but the \"uvcvideo\" module does the job flawlessly.\n\nA: If you want to record HDCP protected content, there is hardware available that can strip this before you input into your capture card. For instance there is a SCART to HDMI converter that also has an HDMI input that passes through without HDCP.\n\nA: As of 2017, there are now several moderately priced UVC-compatible HDMI capture dongles out there which works without hassle.

Thus, I took a quick look at what other environment variables could be useful for this purpose.\nMy conclusion was to use the XDG_VTNR (XDG virtual terminal number?) variable. Since Ubuntu uses VT#7 for the desktop environment, a simple check for whether this variable is greater than or equal to 7 does the trick.\nI have bash function that builds my prompt anyway, so I just surrounded the title escape sequence addition with a check against the XDG_VTNR variable.\nFor example, note the bolded portion below:\n\n# Use new test (i.e. [[ ]]) so as not to fail if XDG_VTNR does not exist\nif [[ $XDG_VTNR -ge 7 ]]; then\n  # Add the window title escape sequence to the prompt\nelse\n  # Don't add the window title escape sequence to the prompt\nfi  \n\nJust wanted to add this note in case it can be useful for anyone else.\n", "Q: Flatten directory with incrementing names I need a bash script for flattening a directory with same names, and get an ordered output after a conversion.\ninput folder structure:\n/in1/file1.wav\n/in1/file2.wav\n/in1/file3.wav\n\n/in2/file1.wav\n/in2/file2.wav\n/in2/file3.wav\n/in2/file4.wav\n\n/in3/file1.wav\n/in3/file2.wav\n\nand I need an output directory like this:\n/out/file0001.mp3\n/out/file0002.mp3\n/out/file0003.mp3\n/out/file0004.mp3\n/out/file0005.mp3\n/out/file0006.mp3\n/out/file0007.mp3\n/out/file0008.mp3\n/out/file0009.mp3\n\nwhere /out/file004.mp3 is the mp3 conversion of /in2/file1.wav\nI've done some trials with find -exec but I can't get it to work\n(don't worry about conversion, I just use ffmpeg -i fileinput fileoutput.mp3)\n\nA: ok, i understand that shell scripting is a really power tool but it is real mess:\ni have tried with thefourtheye answer but the sort command messed everything up because of the order was like this:\nSequence 1.wav\nSequence 10.wav\nSequence 11.wav\nSequence 12.wav\nSequence 2.wav\nSequence 3.wav\nSequence 4.wav\n...\n\nand the spaces was a problem so i had to add \" but there was some mess too i don't remember exactly where, then i tried to put some debug print and it didn't work so...\nIn the end I tested it on a Mac OS/X terminal and it has another shell i never heard about (zsh) that uses different commands.. a big mess.\nI came up with a small python script.

It provides a listing of available software packages that are available to download and install from the repositories listed in your Software Sources. Synaptic is less intimidating to use than apt-get in a Terminal interface for users not used to dealing with the command line.\nPreceding commands in Terminal/command line with sudo imparts a restricted root-user ability for performing commands that are not available for standard user accounts.\nWhen in doubt about any basic command in Terminal, you can always man [base command] to access the command manual pages. man sudo will show the manual for sudo, for example. There is also extensive documentation on the Ubuntu website for most commands.\nAs for installing Opera, it is not maintained in the standard Ubuntu repositories. You have two options:\n1) add the Opera repository to your Software Sources as mentioned in the other answer and following the directions in the provided link; or\n2) download and install Opera manually.\nTo install Opera manually, go to the Opera website (www.opera.com) and download it from there. Presuming that you have your downloads set to go to your Downloads Folder, you can run the following in Terminal:\ncd /home/your_account/Downloads ;ls -l\nReplace \"your_account\"  with your short name; the \"ls -l\" will list the contents of the Downloads folder. Locate the Opera package file - it should be something like 'Opera_12.15.1748_amd64.deb'.\nsudo dpkg -i Opera_12.15.1748_amd64.deb and enter your password when prompted. This will run the Opera installer.\nIn order to have Opera updated automatically, you should still add the Opera repository to your list of software sources.\n\nA: Opera is available as a snap package in all currently supported versions of Ubuntu. To install Opera open the terminal and type:\nsudo snap install opera  \n\nOpera web browser comes with built-in ad blocker, battery saver and free VPN.\n\nA: By the time this question was answered, things have evolved.\nBy now, you can simply go to Download Opera browser, then click the button above Opera for Windows, Mac or Linux and the website will detect your operating system and processor architecture (32 or 64 bits) using device fingerprinting and prompt you a .deb package to download and install by a simple click using the Ubuntu Software Center.\nUpdate (09/12/2017):\nI just tested this again on 2 different virtual machines (Ubuntu 16.04 and 17.04 LTS), and the procedure worked as described above.\n\nA: How to install Opera on Ubuntu: \nFrom the terminal, add a pointer to the opera stable sources:\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"deb http://deb.opera.com/opera/ stable non-free\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opera.list'\n\nInstall the key:\nsudo sh -c 'wget -O - http://deb.opera.com/archive.key | apt-key add -'\n\nUpdate repo:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nInstall Opera:\nsudo apt-get install opera\n\n\nA: Open Terminal ( Ctrl + Alt + T).\nImport the public signing key for Opera\nwget -qO- https://deb.opera.com/archive.key | sudo apt-key add -\n\nRun the following command to add Opera browser repository to the system.\necho \"deb https://deb.opera.com/opera-stable/ stable non-free\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opera-stable.list\n\nUpdate the repository index.\nsudo apt-get update\n\nInstall the Opera browser using the apt command.\nsudo apt-get install -y opera-stable\n\nWhile installing Opera, the installer will ask you to set up Opera repository for easy upgrade of Opera browser by which you can easily upgrade Opera during the regular system upgrades.

It's just a hidden directory in your home folder. In order to view hidden files and folders, you can press Ctrl+h. Select the folder and delete it as you would with any other file. Then use the previous combination to hide them again. You can also view or hide hidden files using the menu. \nIf the folder isn't there, then you can't delete it.

I'm making up plans for when I eventually want to build my own gaming desktop with Ubuntu installed and use the steam client Linux version. The only thing I'm having problems with is what are the best type of graphics cards/drivers for Ubuntu? Other words, which company has the best support for developing the graphics cards/drivers that are used on Ubuntu? Should I choose AMD,Intel,or Nvidia for my graphics card?  \n\nA: I'll try to answer, knowing I risk flames because this is mainly based on personal experience. I tried to approach all GPU providers with an open mind when I was evaluating them though...\nThis is my understanding at the moment:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel supports open source drivers for Linux (which is nice), but the HD2500/HD4000 graphics on the CPUs is only good enough for low settings or \"facebook games\".\n\n*AMD GPUs are good value, but have problems with drivers. They've only recently in the past few years started (actively?) supporting open source drivers (which is nice), but the open source driver isn't quite \"there\" yet. The proprietary driver(s) also have problems: I fought with them for a couple of weeks with a HD7770, but in the end I gave up because I couldn't get it to work properly. Other people's mileage seems to vary though.\n\n*nVidia doesn't support open source (to my knowledge), forcing the \"nouveau\" open source driver to be reverse engineered. As such, it lacks some access to certain processing features on the cards. The proprietary driver, while not perfect in that it still has tearing and things, is easy to install and is pretty close to \"just works\".\n\n\nI'd really, really wanted the AMD card to work, but it broke me. I've settled on nVidia because of the convenience...for now.\n", "Q: Some sites not opening in firefox I am unable to open Yahoo hdfc and some other sites with Mozilla, Chromium\nI tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*changing DNS\n\n*enabling Java\n\n*reinstalling Firefox\n\n\nA: I am kinda in the same situation... hunting online, I see many users have got the same problem resolved by running a scan on their systems for malwares (they are working on windows systems).

Now, with large memory sticks being cheap, I think it would be nice to have many or all official flavours available on one memory stick. That is; you boot from a memory stick and get a menu which lets you choose between the most current version, the latest LTS, 32- and -64 bit, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu, etc. This would make for a very nice way to demonstrate different flavours and also choose 32- or 64-bit as appropriate. \nWhat would be the best way to accomplish this?\n\nA: I think probably the best (Linux) way to create a Multi-OS Live USB Memory Stick (if I understood you correctly), including different Ubuntu flavors as well as other live Operating Systems (e.g. Parted Magic, including Clonezilla, for backup, recovery and other maintenance purposes) is:\nMultiSystem\nwhich I've been using happily for several years now.\nIf you're not comfortable with French or Google-Translate-powered translation, you can also see furher info here: www.pendrivelinux.com/multiboot-create-a-multiboot-usb-from-linux\n\nA: You can use Yumi.

It should not over write your data in your home directory.\n\nSince Hardy it is possible to reinstall Ubuntu without losing the content of the /home folder (the folder that contains program settings, internet bookmarks, emails and all your documents, music, videos and other user files). This can be done even if /home is not on a separate partition (which is the case by default if you did not manually separate it when installing Ubuntu originally).\n\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuReinstallation\n\nA: If its one bad sector, I wouldn't worry about it.  But as more blocks become incapable of being written to from overuse the same thing happens. Eventually you'll start losing usable capacity though. \n\nQuestion\nMy SSD has a lot of bad sectors. Do I need to replace it?\nAnswer\nWith a traditional hard drive, that is often the case, but with an SSD\n  things are a bit different. Due to the nature of flash technology it's\n  normal to have a small number of bad sectors on an SSD, and as long as\n  the number of bad sectors remains constant there is no reason for\n  concern. The firmware on the SSD keeps track of all bad sectors and\n  marks them as unusable. So even though the bad sectors are present on\n  the drive they never come into play, and data is never written to\n  them.\nThe easiest way to keep track of the number of bad sectors on an SSD\n  is to run ChkDsk (short for \"check disk\") in Windows. After checking\n  the drive, ChkDsk will report the number of bad sectors it found.\n  Simply make a note of what that number is, and run ChkDsk again after\n  a couple of days.\nIf the number of bad sectors remains the same, all is well.  If the\n  number of bad sectors is increasing over time, its time to replace the\n  drive.1\n\nYou can use dd to copy the data if you feel that you need to, and its a good idea, but as I stated, one bad sector is not bad, specially since manufacturers add spare sectors, just for this reason.\n1Source:Crucial\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 RAOP to Airport Express 2nd Generation doesn't work, how do I debug and get it working? I have never had any luck with RAOP or Stream2Ip from Ubuntu 12.04 or 13.04 to my airport express 2nd generation.\nIn pulseaudio the airplay device either discovered by RAOP in paprefs or connected to by stream2ip appears and is selectable. However, when I start to play audio from VLC or Rhythmbox the players just sit there. The play button is \"pressed\" and the pause icon appears but the track doesn't start playing it just 'sits there'. No audio at all. If I change the output back to local speakers then the track starts playing.\nIt's frustrating to say the least, no one else seems to report this issue.\nHow can I debug what is going awry?\n\nA: Unfortunately we do not have an Airport Express 2nd generation to test and debug this here. In case the old RAOP protocol is still recognized and supported by this device we may however be successful in streaming audio.\n\n\n*\n\n*With my old 1st generation Airport Express I was able to reproduce the behaviour of your player stopping playback after I added a wrong port to the IP of the device.\n\n*In newer Airport Express devices it was possible to change the port the device listens to from default 5000 to any other port. That is why stream2ip >= 0.3.4 supports streaming via a port different to default 5000 (as was in 1st generation devices). You can do so by adding this port to the IP of the device:\n192.168.xxx.xxx:<port>\n\n\nLet me therefore suggest you find the port of your device (best from the setup programm run from Windows or MacOS) and try if adding this port to the IP line resolves the issue.\nWe can not however provide a solution for devices where the stream is set up to be password protected and hence needs encryption (this encryption is not open source).\nWe also can not support the newer RAOP2 protocol used in newer AirPlay devices as it still is not available for pulseaudio.\n", "Q: How to set up D-LINK DWA-111 USB WLAN Adapter?

In the \nupper corner of Mate,  Go to System > Administration, then to LightDM GTK+ Greeter Settings and enter your password. In the next window, click upper right on Misc., there you will find Timeout Until The Screen Blanks and it will be set at 1 Minute by default. Just move the slider to the left to Never.  This may also be the case in Lubuntu, but it was definitely the issue in Mate 15.10.\n\nA: Lubuntu 16.04 LTS.\nI tried following the instructions from Arturo Veras by installing xfce4-power-manager. When I tried, it said it was already the latest version so I ran it.  It's the same as going through the menu: \nLubuntu | Preferences | Power Manager\nI tried it before finding Arturo's information, but apparently, I didn't do something right. This time, I set the following settings under \"Plugged In\"\nBlank After: Never\nPut to sleep after: Never\nSwitch off after: Never\nOn inactivity reduce to : 80%\nReduce after: Never (But, I may change this one.) \nI went to supper, ate, cleaned dishes, made smoothies and sat down to write this and it still hasn't gone blank. :) \nIn the Lubuntu 16.04 LTS install from the live flash drive, Xfce Power Manager was automatically installed so I didn't need to do the command line.  \nI hope this will be helpful to the next GUI minded user. \n\nA: I believe I've found a solution to this problem. I've recently update from Ubuntu Mate 15.04, in which the black screen made me crazy, to 15.10, with a new installation. With the new version, after I set it up the screensaver off, everything seemed to work fine, no black screen at all. After that, I made a few customizations of the system, the last one of which was to delete from the startup applications, the power manager (I use a desktop pc so I thought that was a useless waste of time to run it). After that, and after a reboot, the hated black screen shown itself again. So I created a new startup application named Power manager and I set \"mate-power-manager\" as command. This simply solution worked for me and I believe that I got the problem in 15.04 for the same reason. Hope this helps.\n\nA: While viewing videos on my htpc, the screen would blank after 10 minutes with no keyboard/mouse input. Obviously not desirable behaviour for an htpc. Turning off screensavers and power saving did not have any effect. Eventually, my web searches led me to believe this was caused by the xserver. I tested this by running the following:\nxset s off && xset -dpms\n\nin a terminal at the beginning of a session and confirmed that this did eliminate the undesired screen blanking. Running xset -q in the terminal confirms DPMS (Energy Star) was disabled.\nIn order to avoid having to open a terminal and run this command at the start of each session, I set this to run at system boot. The screen blanking was back and xset -q showed DPMS enabled. Further searching revealed this behaviour is initiated at login and overrides the command run at boot. To run this automatically, just add the lines below to the end of the .profile in your Home folder.\n# Turn off screen blanking\n\nxset s off && xset -dpms\n\nIf you don't see .profile, open your Home folder in your file browser, click on 'View' and select 'Show Hidden Files'. Then just right click on .profile, select 'Open with text editor', copy and paste the above on a blank line at the end of the file and save the modified file.\n\nA: In Greenie Linux (based on Lubuntu) I removed both xscreensaver and lightlocker and installed gnome-screensaver and added it to autostart.\n\nA: There is an app caffeine to manage display switching off (and screensaver). \nsudo apt-get install caffeine\n\nAfter installation you need to run a command caffeine-indicator. Then you will have an icon in tray. Click it and select Activate in popup menu to prevent display to switch off.

I am fine with using grub instead of the windows bootloader, but I want to be able to revert anything in case I screw up.

I have a mac from 2006 and it is already not supported by the new Apple system, so I decided to install Ubuntu 13.04. I installed is alongside OSX, but I noticed that Ubuntu installed itself on a FAT partition. Why is Ubuntu using a FAT partition? Can I change it to EXT4 without losing my data and configuration?\n\nA: My suspicion is that Zagroda is seeing the EFI System Partition (ESP), which is FAT. Another possibility is that an OS X utility is reporting partition types based on their type codes; Ubuntu 13.04 still uses the same type code for its data partitions as Windows uses for FAT and NTFS. A fix to libparted has been in the works for two years, but the libparted developers have been sluggish in pushing it out. The output of both sudo parted /dev/sda print and sudo gdisk -l /dev/sda would be informative. (The latter will require installing the gdisk package.)\nIf this is the case, it's because Disk Manager is using the GPT type code data, which Linux sets incorrectly. You can fix this by using gdisk from either Linux or OS X: Launch it, type p to view the partitions, and then use t to change the type code of any Linux partition shown as being of type 0700 so that it's of type 8300. When you're done, review your changes with p and then type w to save them.\n", "Q: ffmpeg for 13.04 I have a question how to get ffmpeg with x264 support for ubuntu 13.04 \nI used to use this ppa https://launchpad.net/~jon-severinsson/+archive/ffmpeg\nbut as far as I understand 13.04 is not supported so any other way to get it ??\nThank you in advanced \n\nA: The maintainer hasn't built the .deb packages for 13.04 yet.

I wanna ask if I buy a usb 3 flash disk and make it a live usb  ,would this live usb (usb 3.0) work 10 times faster than live usb (usb 2) ?\nthanks\n\nA: Short answer: No.\nMy recommendation:\nGet a small (2,5\" USB3) external harddisk instead of a USB flash. This will make your system feel 10 times as fast, even if the transfer speed isn't. Or, if you have the cash, get a cheap 64GB external SSD.\nThe reason is that with normal USB flash media the access times are really slow, with harddisks this is much better, and with SSD disks they are another 10x faster. The raw data rate of the bus (USB2 vs. USB3) also differs, but doesn't matter so much unless you do a lot of raw data transfer (i.e. copying very few very large files).\nI have tried all of the above. Summary:\n\n\n*\n\n*USB3 stick on USB3 port: Works, is usable, boots in ~60 seconds (new install).\n\n*USB3 stick on USB2 port: Works, is usable, boots in ~65 seconds (new install).\n\n*USB3 disk on USB3 port: Works, is a lot faster, boots in ~40 seconds (new install).\n\n*USB3 disk on USB2 port: Works, also a lot faster, boots in ~50 seconds (new install).\n\n\nWhen using the harddisk the actual port (USB2 vs USB3) doesn't matter so much in daily usage. I connect it to the USB3 port unless I have to transfer a lot of data to a second USB3 disk, in which case this disk will get the USB3 port.\nHere are the raw data rates of the respective combinations:\n\n\n*\n\n*USB3 stick on USB3 port: ~30 MB/s read, ~10MB/s write\n\n*USB3 stick on USB2 port: ~20 MB/s read, ~10MB/s write\n\n*USB3 disk on USB3 port: ~75..90 MB/s according to hdparm\n\n*USB3 disk on USB2 port: ~25..35 MB/s according to hdparm\n\n\nBut, as I said, these are not the primary concern for a system disk. The access times are much more important.\n\nA: would depend on the flash drives read speed, just cause something says it uses a new interface does not mean it has anything to gain (eg sata3 HDDs)\nalso i think it would require the linux kernel you are booting to support usb3 for it to get the extra speed, so don't expect ubuntu 10.04 to boot faster with it\nif you require a special driver for your usb3 controller don't expect it to boot faster\ni have not tried booting with a usb3 drive, so consider this general info\n", "Q: Running LiveUSB vs install Ubuntu on USB drive What is main differences between running Ubuntu on LiveUSB (created with Startup Disk Creator with persistent storage) and install Ubuntu to partitions on USB disk?\nI love LiveUSB but I can't put password on it, and it's a pain if I need to click Try Ubuntu everytime.\nIf I just complete install Ubuntu to USB disk, is there any performance issue? And, will it run on almost any computer like LiveUSB do?\n\nA: There are two differences. \nFirst LiveUSB is meant to be run that way. You boot the best way for USB, you access the best way for USB and your \"partition\" the best way for USB (even if you don't actually do it your self). Installing Ubuntu to a USB disk will not let Ubuntu know to take special precautions because your using a removable disk. Most notable liveUSB stores the root file system in RAM where an installed instance the root partition would be on disk.\nSecond, booting to USB takes a special setup. Not saying that Linux can't do it, but it could get a bit harry around the time when grub tries to install or update. Most usb installs will use something like ISOLinux or similar to allow booting. UMS drivers may or may not work from the BIOS/EFI level to allow you to boot a normal system. In short, installing and booting Ubuntu from a USB drive could be more of a PIA then it's worth in regards to booting or updating the booting. \nAs a side note, you will need etx3 and USB modules complied into the kernel to boot a root file system from USB. I am not sure they are (the USB ones) by default. --This is a side note because they may be modules included in initramfs, I just don't know but if your going to boot root from USB then your going to have to find out.\n\nA: Short and Sweet - \nLive USB is nothing but running Ubuntu like a Live CD. Changes wont be saved, etc,etc.\nWhile if u install Ubuntu on a USB, it is just like having Ubuntu Installed on a HardDisk!\nI have used the 2nd option many times, and it gives u the best portable OS ever!\nPerformance... yes it will run a little slower than usual on USB 2.0\non USB 3.0 its fast enough, provided you don't clutter it with too many installs and data.\nNeedless to say, your USB life expectancy will be reduced as there will be immense number of Read/Write cycles(it still isnt too less)\nI would suggest you a USB Install instead of Live USB.\nHope you know the procedure. If not, post another question(for better understanding for people who refer later) and you will get a guide easily! :)\nThankyou :)\n\nA: There are three main alternatives to run Ubuntu from a USB drive,\n\n\n*\n\n*live-only\n\n*persistent live\n\n*installed system\n\n\nA persistent live system is an alternative 'between' a live-only system and an installed system (installed like in an internal drive, but in a USB drive).

W8 provides all you need from Windows (this is not sarcastic mend  lol). \nTo be short: in UEFI should be an option for switching of the secure boot option.

I'm using ubuntu server 12.04, now I want to backup some files using rsync, here is a try:\nrsync -aAX $HOME/Documents/* $HOME/Backups/TEST --exclude={$HOME/Documents/another/*,$HOME/Documents/temp/*} \n\nAs you can see, I want to backup all files in the folder $HOME/Documents to folder $HOME/Backups/TEST, but exclude files in folder another and temp. But I failed, rsync still copied the files in both excluded folders:\nls $HOME/Backups/TEST/another\ntest\n\ntest is a file in the folder another, and it is also copied though I exclude the file in rsync, why? How to let those files be actually excluded?\n\nA: You may find it easier to add .rsync-filter files in your source directories, and use the -F option.\nFrom the man page:\n\n-F : The  -F  option is a shorthand [...] for this rule:\n --filter='dir-merge /.rsync-filter'\n\nThis tells rsync to look for per-directory .rsync-filter files\n  that have been sprinkled through the hierarchy and use their\n  rules to filter the files in the transfer.\n\nFor example: in $HOME/Documents/.rsync-filter\n# you can add comments in filter files\n\n- /another/\n- /temp/\n\nInstead of -, you can also write the whole word exclude.\nNow you can\nrsync -aAX -F $HOME/Documents/ $HOME/Backups/TEST/\n\n\nA: There are several issues with your rsync command (also see manpage for rsync for detailed explanation of filter rules).\n\n\n*\n\n*we need an --exclude command each for any given pattern.  \n\n*paths given need to be relative to the source path (no absolute paths).  \n\n*options need to be given before we state source and destination.\n\n\nFor your example the following syntax will work:\nrsync -avAX --exclude=another/ --exclude=temp/ ~/Documents/ ~/Backups/TEST\n\nNote that if an exlude pattern ends with / it refers to a directory. If you omit it both, files and directories with that name will be excluded.

I have read this question, but it was asked in the context of servers not desktops or notebooks.\nIf a good amount of RAM is installed on a notebook, say 8 GB, do we still need a swap space?\n\nA: For the last 6 years or so I have used desktop systems with at least 8GB RAM. I don't remember a case when the system swapped out memory under normal usage - and I monitor resource usage quite often with htop. Not even in cases when I ran 4 virtual machines (servers) simultaneously for development purposes did swapping occur. \nHaving said that, if the applications you are running are memory intensive (eg video editing, image editing, large database table manipulation, etc) you may face a situation where your system might run out of memory. In that case it may be desirable to have a swap space. Think of it as a last resort safety net. And considering the multi-terrabyte capacity of today's systems, what's a couple of gigabytes in a swap partition worth? Better be safe than sorry :-)\n\nA: There is a common misconception that having a swap space is negatively affecting system performance. This is incorrect. As long as you have enough RAM, having a swap area whatever its size doesn't hurt performance at all. What affects performance is being short in RAM and effectively using the swap space.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have no swap space and happen to be out of RAM, the kernel will pick one or more processes which it thinks are good candidates (although you might give it some hints though) and kill them.\n\n*If you have a swap space and are out of RAM, the kernel will pick less used memory pages and put them on the swap area to free RAM. This will slow down the system but your applications won't be affected otherwise.\nI always prefer case 2. as I feel uncomfortable loosing parts or all of my work because the kernel thinks my applications are worth killing. Moreover, with the current size of an average disk being in the TB range, reserving a few percent for swap is usually not an issue.\n\nA: Having swap space is always a good thing.\nHere I'm quoting Michael Jang's RHCSA/RHCE Certification Study Guide\n\nLinux Swap Space\nSuch space is used to extend the amount of effective RAM on a system,\nas virtual memory for currently running programs. But you can’t just\nbuy extra RAM and eliminate swap space. Linux moves infrequently used\nprograms and data to swap space even if you have gigabytes of RAM..\nFor systems of up to 2GB, the default swap space size is twice the\namount of installed RAM. Above 2GB, it’s the amount of RAM + 2GB. But\nthose are not “hard and fast” rules. Workstations with several GB of\nRAM frequently use very little swap space.. but it may be used more\nfrequently on systems that aren’t rebooted for months at a time or\nhave heavy demand from certain services.\n\nIn my experience, most servers usually do not require that amount of swap space, though it never hurts to have more. For desktops, the above instructions make more sense, so to support hibernation and such.\n\nA: It depends on what you are running on your system.\nIf you are creating content, it is probably a good idea to still have swap space allocated, so if you do run out of RAM, your processes just get slow instead of being killed and potentially losing work.\nIf your machine is just running programs, then you don't need or even want swap space. I design and build many kiosk-like display systems that fit this usage exactly. I'd rather a process die suddenly than be slow, because then I can detect that condition and correct it.\n\nA: If you have a RAM of 3GB or higher, Ubuntu will automatically NOT USE the Swap space since it's more than enough for the OS. \nNow do you really need a swap partition?\nThe answer in my opinion is yes.  Because you don't know what will you be installing or doing in the future that might require the need of swap space.  Also if you're planning to use hibernation, you might want to have some swap space.  You actually don't have to have swap partition, but it is recommended in case you do use up that much memory in normal operation. \nFor more information on the need or not fro swap, see Ubuntu Swap Faq, or Swap Requirements\n\nA: If you ever need swap or more swap space you can create swap files on your file system. Of course, they will not support hibernation but it is a reasonable approach for a laptop with SSD drive and a lot of RAM.\n", "Q: How do I enable live window resizing in Ubuntu 13.04? In Ubuntu 13.04 when you resize an application window by clicking with the mouse on any of its borders the whole window area gets covered by an orange transparent film; if then the mouse cursor is moved in any direction the orange area is dynamically changed following the mouse cursor position, but the window size gets actually changed only when the mouse button is released.\nHow do I change this behavior so that the window size is actually changed on the fly with the mouse cursor?\n\nA: If you install the CompizConfig Settings Manager, you can tweak the resize setting:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nThen run it either by firing up the dash and searching for CompizConfig, or run ccsm from the terminal.\nLook under Window Management -> Resize Window -> General -> Default Resize Mode and change it to Normal and you should have sensible window resizing again!\n", "Q: How to add more than four keyboard layouts in Ubuntu 12.04? How to add more than four keyboard layouts in Ubuntu 12.04?\nI am surprised that I can't add more than four language keyboard layouts.\n\nA: Right now it seems impossible to set up more than 4 keyboard layouts in Ubuntu.\nA workaround would be to enable keyboard shortcuts that would execute a special command to switch to a particular keyboard layout.\nTherefore:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts\n\n*Add the first new custom shortcut, let's say \"US English\", with command setxkbmap us. Then, once you press Ok on it, set the shortcut to Ctrl+F1.\n\n*Then, add \"Greek' for example, with command setxkbmap gr and shortcut Ctrl+F2.\n\n*You can add more layouts. \n\n\nLook into /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/ for the correct layout file (like 'us', 'gr').\nYou then switch with Ctrl+F1, Ctrl+F2, etc.\n", "Q: Where is Unity startup script in rc?.d I've been reading about runlevels and startup scripts lately, and I've learnt that runlevels 2 to 5 are the same in Ubuntu, and that Ubuntu's default runlevel is 2.\nWhat I want to do\nI want to remove the script that starts Unity from runlevel 3, or actually prefix it with a \"K\" to kill it when I switch from runlevel 2 to 3.\nWhy do I want to do it\nI want to experiment with runlevels and understand \"init\" and startup scripts and all that.

What you're looking at on boot is lightdm.\nThe reason you see neither of those is because Ubuntu uses a combination of Upstart and sysvinit to start services on boot. The rcX.d directories are only for things that have not been migrated to Upstart.\nLightdm is started on a bunch of hardware events by Upstart. This is done so that it can start as soon as possible and own the \"console\" as it shifts from the boot console (plymouth) to lightdm. This also means it can start interacting with the user while other system services are still starting. You can see how it starts up in /etc/init/lightdm.conf.\nUpstart still uses runlevel, so you can look for things like start on runlevel [2345] and stop on runlevel [016] in /etc/init/* to find things to play with to test out other run levels.\n", "Q: Best practice: version numbers for own packages Recently I've started packaging software with fpm. The public makefiles can be found on bitbucket.\nBut I've a problem with version numbers. When I'm generating a package for e.g. the fish-shell I would have to make clear, that the original version of the package hasn't changed, but that this would be the e.g. second package I've generated, so that it can replace the previously generated package.\nIs there a best practice or convention?\n\nA: The field is :  \ndebian_revision  \n\n          This part of the version number specifies  the  version  of  the\n          Debian  package  based  on the upstream version.

This format represents the case where\n          a piece of software was written specifically to be turned into a\n          Debian  package,  and so there is only one \"debianisation\" of it\n          and therefore no revision indication is required.\n\n          It is conventional to restart the debian_revision  at  ’1’  each\n          time time the upstream_version is increased.\n\n          Dpkg  will  break the version number apart at the last hyphen in\n          the string (if there is one) to determine  the  upstream_version\n          and  debian_revision.  The absence of a debian_revision compares\n          earlier  than  the  presence  of  one   (but   note   that   the\n          debian_revision  is  the  least  significant part of the version\n          number).\n\nReference \n", "Q: Downloads folder restores automatically over the last couple of days  i've noticed that each time the downloads folder is modified, ie, any new file is downloaded, previously deleted folders are restored.

Is that can any change of my harddisk.\n\nA: This is assuming that you already have Windows installed on your machine, and you want to install Ubuntu alongside it, without changing any thing on your hard disk.\nThe best way to install Ubuntu without making any changes to your hard disk is using Wubi.\nWhat is it?\nWubi is a utility that comes in the Ubuntu ISO that you downloaded. It helps install Ubuntu on Windows.\nWhat does it do?\nWubi will install Ubuntu on your Windows machine as if Ubuntu were just a normal program. It will not delete anything nor will it change anything in your hard disk; it will only take up some space just like any other program. You'll actually find it in your Add/Remove Programs (or Programs and Features). So, if after you install Ubuntu using Wubi, you want to remove it, just go to Add/Remove Programs and remove it.\nHow to install Ubuntu using Wubi\nWubi is already included in the ISO file that you downloaded from Ubuntu.com. All you have to do is mount the ISO (or insert the CD, or insert the USB) in Windows. You'll get the autoplay box that asks you to \"Run Wubi Installer\". If the autoplay box does not appear, simply double click the CD icon in your My Computer. If it still doesn't do anything, double click on \"wubi.exe\" inside the CD/USB. Continue with the installation. I would advice installing Ubuntu on some other partition (like D or E) other than the C partition. Once done, restart your computer, and you'll be presented with an option to go into Windows or Ubuntu.

From a security standpoint, the less number of services you run the less exposed you are to external attacks (fewer \"attack vectors\" in the industry parlance.)\nKeep in mind that some times the service you are planning to provide depends on other services (for example it makes little sense to run an e-shop and not offer the means to communicate by e-mail with your users.) \nIt really all depends on what your use case is.

Spent several months making the choice. The OS is on the 500GB HDD, and the 32GB SSD is used as cache.. seems standard.\nI've been wanting to get into Linux for some time. I want to move my programming environment out of Windows, and then only use Win for heavy graphics and video editing, which I don't do as often.\nSo... What is the best configuration that I can do? I still will be using Windows daily, and for all my media needs.\nHow much space does Win 8 really need? Including apps such as Creative Suite 6, PHP Storm, and 3DMax (my three workflows)?\nI can't decide whether it would be better to re-install Win 8 and its apps all on the SSD (probably not adequate size), and split the HDD between a small Linux partition and the rest, data..\nOr sacrifice Intel Rapid Start and put Linux on the SSD, and Win 8 on the HDD.\nOr if I should set up it again as dell has it, and just create a separate partition on the HDD for Linux..\nThoughts?\n\nA: Personally I'd never be able to constrain my OS to use just 32GB of space, be it Linux or Windows.\nWhat you can do if you know you're not going to install a huge amount of programs to your Linux OS is create a separate partition for your /home directory.\nThat's like the C:\\Users directory in Windows.\nWhen you're installing Ubuntu you just go to the advanced partitioning option during install, where you specify your SSD to use an EXT4 partition for most of the drive, leaving 1-2GB or so to create your \"swap\" partition, which is like the pagefile in windows, except obviously it's a partition not a file.\nThen you allocate another EXT4 partition on your 500GB drive, and that one will be for your home directory.\nYou can set up the partitions using gparted or some other partitioning tool beforehand if you like, but when you're doing your Ubuntu install, you need to go to the advanced setup option where you set the partitions, so that you can allocate the mount points.\nSo you set the EXT4 SSD to use: \"/\" as its' mount point, which means it will be the root directory.\nThen you set the EXT4 partition on your 500GB drive as the \"/home\" mount point. Which will tell the Ubuntu installer to use that partition for your equivalent of C:\\Users.\nNeat huh :0)\nOnly problem for me is that I think I'd probably even install more than 32GB of programs on the root fs. As even though I'd be installing all my windows games in wine, which stores it's files in the home directory, I found particularly when getting used to Linux, I became a package manager fiend... Once you open the Ubuntu software centre and there's millions of free apps which you're not already familiar with, it's awfully tempting to just go through and install piles of programs just to get familiar with them cause there FREEEEE! :OP\nAs for windows, I know that you can move the MyDocuments and MyVideos folders etc to a separate partition, but generally Windows is a space hog anyway so I'd definitely want to leave at least half of your 500GB drive for Windows.\nBearing in mind that you can mount your NTFS partitions inside Linux and read and write files, (without the ability to set file permissions).\nWhile on Windows, you won't be able to easily mount your EXT4 partitions. There are programs I use like this one:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/ext2read/\nWhich will allow you to read your EXT4 partitions in Windows, but with that particular one you have to copy the files to the NTFS partition before you can open them.\nWhere as http://www.ext2fsd.com/\nI think would allow you to mount your EXT4 partitions in Windows, but I found it tricky to set up and potentially a risk of damaging your data.\nHaving said all of which, if you're editing digital media I think it would be nice to have a 32GB SSD to use for working with your large image and video files, if you're going to be doing things that require a lot of read/write of the data. For example if you want to edit segments of video and save multiple copies while you're working with them. Though if you're working with video, 32GB would be a bit confining. I'd go for a larger SSD.\nWhatever you decide to do, you can always copy your Linux partitions to another disk in the future if you choose to, and they'll boot just fine. You just need to boot up something like:\nhttp://sourceforge.net/p/boot-repair-cd/home/Home/\nor http://www.supergrubdisk.org/rescatux/\nWhich will let you update your grub2 boot loader configuration so that they point to the new hard drive.\nYou can also do that with windows by changing your BCD, http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/ht/rebuild-bcd-store-windows.htm \n", "Q: --mandir command not found I am trying to set up uShare for my xbox, but I run into the next error.\nI have installed uShare and the source code, and also extracted the source code with\nwget http://ushare.geexbox.org/releases/ushare-1.1a.tar.bz2 -O - | tar -jxvf -\n\nand I set the directory to this ./ushare-1.1a.

Please help.  \n\nA: Sounds as though your problem might not be that you've forgotten your password, but that Unity is not starting correctly due to some configuration error. Perhaps your problem started after installing Nvidia drivers or Radeon drivers?\nDepending on what is causing your problem there are a number of solutions you could try:\n1.) Uninstall your nvidia or radeon drivers:\nHold down CTRL and ALT and F2 together. This should take you to a login prompt where you can type your username, and your password. Once in, type this to remove your drivers:\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia* fglrx*\n( you may need to do more than that to get rid of the drivers if you installed the binary versions from the AMD and Nvidia websites)\n2.) If you've just installed Ubuntu and have never been able to log in with this version, it may be because your hardware is too old to support 3D graphics, and in this case I'd recommend you install Lubuntu instead:\nhttp://lubuntu.net/\n3.) If you can't log in at all it may be because you have set your password incorrectly or you've forgotten your password.\nHere are some instructions on how to reset your password in Linux:\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-reset-forgotten-root-password/\nBut when you get to the bit where you enter \"passwd\" put your user name in front of the command. So on my computer it looks like: passwd damonsaccount\nWhere as for your user account it may look like: passwd Manasbs788\nYou can also create a new user account while you're there by doing:\nuseradd Manasbs788\nthen: passwd Manasbs788\n(and entering a password, making sure to write it down somewhere for later!)\n", "Q: Ubuntu can't connect to WIFI network Our company network administrator had previously registered my Win8 laptop on the network. In Win8 I can connect to the network (by clicking its name in available networks)and to connect to the Internet, I have to create a windows broadband connection with my credentials. Now this works even after I re-installed my Win8 from scratch.\nI thought Ubuntu would be the same. But Ubuntu can't even connect to the WIFI network (It shows the network's name, but never connects. The network is open and its type is: access point). Does it have to do something with the registration process? Is there a workaround or should I ask them to \"register\" Ubuntu too? BTW, I have no problem connecting to my home network using either Win8 or Ubuntu.\nedit: I have an android device. By mac spoofing, I changed the mac address of the device to my laptop's mac address and it couldn't connect to the network either. Is there something else happening besides mac address filtering?\n\nA: Hmmm I'm not sure what \"registering\" your Ubuntu system on the network might mean. \nIf your workplace wifi is unencrypted, then Ubuntu may be connecting to the wifi and then being bumped off on the basis of MAC address filtering or some other kind of device verification system.\nI think you need to talk to the IT guys at work... \nClarification: I'm presuming that when you say you have no problems connecting to WIFI at home, that your work PC is a laptop, and you're connecting to your home network with no problems.\nThe first thing to be sure of is that the WIFI driver in Ubuntu is capable of connecting to WIFI at all. So testing connecting to a different network would be good.\nThen if you find you're able to connect to other networks, your next step would be to check that the Ubuntu driver for your WIFI adapter is capable of making your WIFI adapter connect to the particular type of WIFI network that your workplace is using.\nOften times with drivers, there is partial functionality, but not every function works. The problems with Ubuntu bluetooth functionality is a good example of that. \n", "Q: Why doesn't this command work as an alias?

These commands demonstrate it:\n$ alias F=\"echo '$0'\"      \n$ F\nbash\n\nThe shell name (presumably bash) happen to be an unset awk variable name, leading to the empty lines.\nOne way to protect $0 from shell expansion would be to use something like:\nalias F=\"find -type f -size +1k -exec ls -gGsSh1 {} + | awk 'NR<=10 {print \\$0}'\"\n\nHowever, as this $0 is useless, you can just remove it from the awk statement.\nfind -type f -size +10M -exec ls -gGsSh1 {} + | awk 'NR<=10 {print}'\n\nYou can go further and remove the whole block as printing the selected line is awk default behavior anyway:\nfind -type f -size +10M -exec ls -gGsSh1 {} + | awk 'NR<=10'\n\nAlternatively, you can just keep using head and discard the error message:\nfind -type f -size +10M -exec ls -gGsSh1 {} + 2>&1 | head\n\n", "Q: \"libpeas-WARNING **: Could not find loader 'python3' for plugin\" when loading a pluging in gedit I recently upgraded to Ubuntu 13.04 and I use gedit for a lot of things.\nI was trying to install some plugins that I use quite frequently and I came into some issues.\nFirst I installed the plugins like so:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3\nsudo apt-get install gedit-plugins\n\nI can see the plugins in gedit but when I choose to use a plugin via the edit>preferences>plugins menu this message shows up:\n(gedit:6027): libpeas-WARNING **: Could not find loader 'python3' for plugin    \n'codecomment'\n\nI know I have python3 installed because when I type python3 in my terminal I get: \n Python 3.3.1 (default, Apr 17 2013, 22:32:14) \n [GCC 4.7.3] on linux\n Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n >>> \n\nI also have python 2.7.4, by similar terminal command.\nIf anyone can help me get these plugins up and running in gedit I would appreciate it very much. \n\nA: I had the same issue with Ubuntu 12.04 and Gedit 3.4.1, but with a different plug-in.\nThis is how I resolved it: Find the file [plugin-name]*.plugin in gedit's plugin directory and edit the line Loader=python3  to Loader=python\nMy gedit plugin-dir was under /usr/lib/gedit/plugins/ if it helps. \n\nA: Might you have your Python virtual environment messing up the plugins as I had?\nI got plugins like codecomment working by hiding my PYTHONPATH and python virtual environment before launching Gedit.\nSince I still want to use my venv I have an executable script 'gedit' in my path with\n\n#!/bin/bash\nPYTHONPATH= PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games /usr/bin/gedit \"$@\"\n\nAt least this way the plugins work for me.

So you won't have to do any repartitioning.\nThere are instructions here:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-ubuntu-with-windows\nIt doesn't work with Ubuntu 13.04 unfortunately :o\\\nOtherwise:\nYou will need to rearrange your partitions to make space for an EXT4 partition which you will install Ubuntu on. Also you need to leave some space for a 1-2GB 'swap' partition.\nBut I think you'll find that if you're not already experienced in doing this, that you'll end up accidentally wiping your Windows Vista partition, and you'll loose all your data...\nNormally I'd highly recommend Ubuntu 13.04 over 12.04, as there are some really nice changes, but unless you know what you're doing with your partitioning or know someone who can help you do it, I'd advise against it.\nIf you know someone technical who might be willing to help you I'd recommend getting them to use Team Viewer to log onto your computer remotely via the internet. They can then do whatever is necessary to get your partitions set up correctly.\nhttp://www.teamviewer.com\nEither way, I'd recommend you make a backup of your data, as computers have a way of loosing everything you have stored on them when you least expect it.\nA computer can retain you're data for a decade without you ever loosing anything, but one day, something will go awry and in a flash everything you worked on is gone. Partitioning is one of the times that's most likely to happen, even when you know completely what you're doing.\n", "Q: Get Security Updates Delta, and install them I am writing a script that is supposed to run every day to check if there are any new security updates for Ubuntu.\nIf there are, it will make a list of those updates, it will download them, and then run some tests.\nThe purpose of this script is to make sure that no security updates break our code running on the Ubuntu.\nI am not an experienced user with Ubuntu, so forgive me if this question seems trivial. I have researched quite a bit, and found information like this Which is useful I presume to those who are home-users or such. But I can not install extra packages, nor does this provide any solutions for doing it without installing packages, (I tried every answer that did not include downloading new packages)\nSo to refine my question, I would like a command that will fetch all the security updates (so I can see them as a list, and include it in the daily report of which security packages have updates) and then also download and install them. The testing and such I do myself (obviously) I just need help understanding which commands to run.\nSince scripts will be running these commands, they do not need to be human-readable in any specific way, so they can be long and extraneous, or such, and preferably 1-liners that do not require pre-configuration.\n\nA: After some of my own research, and some fiddling around, this is the solution I have found for myself:\ngrep security /etc/apt/sources.list > /tmp/su.list\napt-get -o Dir::Etc::Sourcelist=/tmp/su.list -q update\napt-get -o Dir::Etc::Sourcelist=/tmp/su.list -q upgrade -s 2>&1 | tee /tmp/security_updates_fetch.log\napt-get -o Dir::Etc::Sourcelist=/tmp/su.list -q upgrade -ym --force-yes 2>&1 | tee /tmp/security_updates_install.log\n\nThis will output to the stdout as well as create a few files in /tmp/:\n\n\n*\n\n*/tmp/su.list : Which is a throw-away file after the operation completes.\n\n*security_updates_fetch.log : Contains the updates which will be performed.\n\n*security_updates_install.log : Contains the log of the actual update.\n\n", "Q: Virtualize Ubuntu server 12.0.4 into 3 different containers I have a dedicated server with 2 TB disk space, 16 GB memory.

Your laptop needs to be able to boot from USB HD (if it's not 5 years old it probably can). Make sure you install grub on your external HD during installation.\nYou can make one partition for Ubuntu with ext4 on your external HD and one NTFS for data, where you can put your movies and documents - this NTFS partition will be seen from Windows as well.\nYou should be able to boot from other PCs as well but you should avoid making special settings (hardware dependent).\nYour changes will be saved normally.\nI have just tried this on my laptop and it worked perfectly. When I want to boot Ubuntu I chose the external usb hard disk as boot disk. If I don't do anything it just boots into Windows as usual.\n\nA: There are a few technical considerations of which you need to be aware.\n\n\n*\n\n*First, any computer that uses this needs to be able to boot from USB.\nSo you will need to check the BIOS and make sure that the computer is\ncapable of using it.\n\n*Second, unless your drive and computer are both USB 3 capable, the\nend experience might be so slow and cumbersome that it is only useful\nin an emergency.\n\n\nAll in all, you'd be better off using eSATA if it is available.  I am not trying to discourage experimentation, but an external eSATA drive will be pretty much like using an internal HD and you'll almost certainly be satisfied with the final results.\n", "Q: Share a Folder between two Local Users I and my brother have User Accounts on this machine. I want to share the Documents directory with him.\nIs there a STRAIGHTFORWARD way to do it?\nI am not a power user so I am looking for a way to do this using nautilus, rather than a script or a way that requires creating symlinks.\nI can download an application if i have to.\nLast time I wanted to do this I just copied the contents to /home for both of us to use.\nSomething I can do in System Settings would be appreciated \n\nA: There are three steps to this process\nStep One: Make your brother a member of your group. \nYour group-name is same as your user-id. Say, if your user-ID is akumar your group name is also akumar. If your brother's ID is bkumar, then you want to make bkumar a member of the group akumar. See How to manage users and groups? for how to add your brother's user-ID to your group.\nStep Two: Change the permission of the folder you want to share.\nOpen Nautilus. Right click on the folder you want to share. Go to permissions tab. look for the group permissions and change it into \"Read and Write.\" Check the box for allowing the same permissions to the files and folders inside.\nStep Three: Verify that your brother can create delete files in the shared folder.\nLet your brother login to the computer. Open Nautilus. It will open to your brother's home folder. Navigate to your home folder and open the shared folder by: \nclick on Computer or System Files (depends on the version of Ubuntu) on the left panel.\nDouble click on home folder, double click on folder named akumar inside home.\nCreate a file in the folder. Delete the new file.\nStep Four: (optional) Make a link of this folder to your brother's home folder.\nwhile logged in as your brother, open another window of Nautilus next to the first one, by middle-click or Ctrl+Left click. In your own home folder where the shared folder resides, hold down Ctrl+Shift and drag the shared folder to your brother's home folder. \nHope this helps\n\nA: sudo mkdir /shared\nsudo chmod a+rw /shared\n\nNow everyone can see and edit the /shared folder. Feel free putting files there and everyone will be able to access this folder and share files between users.\n\nA: I would recommend the following solution:\n- Create a group for sharing, just call it \"shared\".\n- Add all users who should have access to the shared files to this group.\n- Create a directory outside of users homes, e.g. /shared for shared files.\n- Change group of this folder to the group for sharing and adjust group permissions.\n- Set group sticky bit for this shared folder.\nAdvantages of this solution:\n- Every file you copy into this folder automatically gets the shared group, so every user who is a member of this group can access these files without any additional effort.\n- You still can have your private files outside this folder with your personal group which are not accessible by other users as long as they cannot get root and they cannot boot with another Linux OS.

It got released 2 weeks ago and gives you access to the very latest version of the installed software. It's also the most user friendly version right now I think and that might be the most important bit for a new user. :)\nThe LTS (Long Term Support) release are for people who choose stability over new features.

Digging up I found that this can happen when hard drives have errors. I used badblocks to check for errors, and indeed I have some damaged sectors.\nIn most cases the only rational course of action is to try to backup data, remove the HDD and buy a new one. However, this server doesn't have anything I already don't have backed up on multiple places, and I'd like to use it till it dies. I use it for streaming music and running some simple scripts. In any case, it would be a big fuss reinstalling everything.\nIs there a way to mark these bad blocks without formatting a hdd?\n\nA: Although this is an old question, I'm posting this because badblocks should not be used to bad block a disk. See man badblocks for more info.\n\n\"It is strongly recommended that users not run badblocks directly, but rather use the -c option of the e2fsck and mke2fs programs\".\n\nNotes\n\n*\n\n*Do NOT abort a bad block scan!\n\n*Do NOT bad block a SSD\n\n*Backup your important files FIRST!\n\n*This will take many hours\n\n*You may have a pending HDD failure\n\nBoot to a Ubuntu Live DVD/USB in “Try Ubuntu” mode.\nIn Terminal:\nsudo fdisk -l  # identify all \"Linux Filesystem\" partitions\n\nsudo e2fsck -fccky /dev/sdXX  # non-destructive read/write test **(recommended)**\n\nor sudo e2fsck -fcky /dev/sdXX # read-only test\nThe -k is important, because it saves the previous bad block table, and adds any new bad blocks to that table. Without -k, you loose all of the prior bad block information.\nThe -fccky parameter:\n   -f    Force checking even if the file system seems clean.\n\n   -c    This option causes e2fsck to use badblocks(8) program to do\n         a read-only scan of the device in order to find any bad blocks.\n         If any bad blocks are found, they are added to the bad block\n         inode to prevent them from being allocated to a file or direc‐\n         tory.  If this option is specified twice, then the bad block scan\n         will be done using a non-destructive read-write test.\n\n   -k    When combined with the -c option, any existing bad blocks in the\n         bad blocks list are preserved, and any new bad blocks found by\n         running badblocks(8) will be added to the existing bad blocks\n         list.\n\n   -y    Assume an answer of `yes' to all questions; allows e2fsck to be\n         used non-interactively. This option may not be specified at the\n         same time as the -n or -p options.\n\n\nA: I assume you are talking about physical bad blocks on a disk and not about corrupted file systems.\nTo check the physical condition of your disk it's best to install smartmontools\nsudo apt-get install smartmontools\n\nThis works because all modern disks log their health status using a system called S.M.A.R.T.\nUse the smartctrl command to read out this status. For example to read all attributes from the first disk call\nsudo smartctl --all /dev/sda\n\nWatch out for a line talking about the overall heath status. Once this indicates an error it's very likely that the disk will fail soon.\nSMART overall-health self-assessment test result: PASSED\n\nOther lines you want to check for are the Pending Sector Count and the Reallocated Sectors.\nID# ATTRIBUTE_NAME          FLAG     VALUE WORST THRESH TYPE      UPDATED  WHEN_FAILED RAW_VALUE\n  5 Reallocated_Sector_Ct   0x0033   100   100   036    Pre-fail  Always       -       48\n197 Current_Pending_Sector  0x0012   100   100   000    Old_age   Always       -       2\n\nReallocated lists usually in the raw field the number of bad sectors the disk exchanged for working spare ones. Pending are sectors which might be reallocated in case the next write fails.\nYou can even trigger self tests of the disk when supported by your model\nsudo smartctl -t long /dev/sda\n\nTo force checking of all sectors, use badblocks in a mode in which data is written. Beware that even though in general it is safe to run, it will put extra load on your disks, which might cause them to fail. Always have a backup of your data.\nsudo badblocks -svvn -c 262144 /dev/sda\n\nThe output from the badblocks command will show you many lines with\nhh:mm:ss elapased. (x/y/z errors)\n\nwhere\nx = num_read_errors\ny = num_write_errors\nz = num_corruption_errors\n\nIf you have fully processed your disk this way, the disk controller should have replaced all bad blocks by working ones and the reallocated count will be increased in the SMART log.\n", "Q: TouchScreen recognized, but not working in 13.04 First, let me mention that one of the first things I tested was the fact that the touchscreen was operating during the GUI installation process.

We need to find a way to make the module wait longer before reporting TIMEOUT. Will look more into this issue.\nEDIT by OP: It appears that your recommendation about 'shutting the lid' was really just suspending the system.  That immediately activates my touchscreen every time.  Try just using 'Suspend' from the Power menu if you have that option enabled, and see if yours behaves similarly?\nDoesn't give us a definitive answer, but I can use LaunchPad to report the bug, and mark your solution as at least a temporary workaround.

As far as I can see, with jitsu I can only specify ONE machine for a particular service. \nSo, after doing:\njitsu deploy-to 1 --config local.yaml local:ceph-osd\n\nI end up with:\nservices:\n  ceph:\n    charm: local:precise/ceph-91\n    relations:\n      mon:\n      - ceph\n    units:\n      ceph/0:\n        agent-state: pending\n        machine: 1\n        public-address: null\n      ceph/1:\n        agent-state: pending\n        machine: 2\n        public-address: null\n      ceph/2:\n        agent-state: pending\n        machine: 3\n        public-address: null\n  ceph-osd:\n    charm: local:precise/ceph-osd-7\n    relations: {}\n    units:\n      ceph-osd/3:\n        agent-state: pending\n        machine: 1\n        public-address: null\n2013-05-06 11:22:09,165 INFO 'status' command finished successfully\n\nNow it appears I have no way of adding ceph-osd service units to machines 2 and 3.\nI would like to do something like add-unit and add in the other two machines.\np.s. Can't add it, but I suggest adding the tag \"jitsu\" to this board.\n\nA: I'm not sure about jitsu deploy-to supporting this feature, but you don't need to deploy the ceph-osd charm with the ceph charm in this way.\nThe ceph charm supports OSD functionality so can be deployed standalone; you can add extra storage capacity later if need be by using the ceph-osd charm.\n\nA: Based on the response from jamespage and based on my other findings, I'd have to say the answer to the question is currently no. Let me explain.\nI can do\njuju deploy ceph -n 3\n\nand juju will setup three nodes with Ceph, machines number 1, 2 and 3. I want to deploy Glance in 3 units across the same three nodes as Ceph. I can't do this. The most I can do is \njitsu deploy-to 1 glance\n\nand Glance will be installed and configured on machine 1 where MySQL also lives. But if I want to scale Glance horizontally, I can't do an add-unit command, because jitsu doesn't currently support it. If I do:\njuju add-unit glance\n\nthen a whole new node is taken, which is not the desired result, which is service co-location.\nI would love to see that feature in jitsu! Specifically, you would be able to do:\njitsu deploy-to 1,2,3 -n 3 glance\n\nand if you wanted to add units to this service, you could do:\njitsu deploy-to 4 add-unit glance\n\nor something similar.\n", "Q: Bash script reading text file - No such file Error I'm writing a script to read a simple text file.\nBut I get only a \"No such file\" message.\nThe file exist and has proper access rigths\nthe code I'm using is:\nFicheiro=\"mensagem\"\nwhile read linha; do\n    echo $linha\ndone < Ficheiro\n\n\nA: You are missing a $\ndone < $Ficheiro\n\n", "Q: learning of mysql with java in ubuntu Hello as Im new to ubuntu i want to learn Mysql database with Java,So how to install the software and configure them for the Programming in ubuntu 13.04 \n\nA: You'll want to take a look at the JDBC\nSetup MySQL\nFirst things first you'll need to setup your MySQL. Install the mysql server and client:\nsudo apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client\n\n(This will install both in the most up to date version within your repositories.)\nYou will be prompted for a root password. Set this to something secure; the root account can access and change all databases.\nYou then need to login and setup the server:\nmysql -u root -p\n\nYou will be prompted for your password and then connected to the server. You need to setup a database (a database contains tables):\nCREATE DATABASE [name];\n\nSome syntax to note in MySQL is that it is case insensitive (you can just write out quickly in lower case as I do, though for clarity in code it's wise to write in capitals with statements) and also you must end every statement with a semi colon.\nSwitch to this database:\nUSE [name];\n\nNow you want to add a user and set permissions to allow the user to edit everything on this database (docs):\nCREATE USER \"[username]\"@\"[host]\" IDENTIFIED BY \"[password]\";\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * TO \"[username]\"@\"[host]\";\n\nThe username is obviously the desired username for the user which will access this database from your java program. The host in both cases is the host which you access from, use % to be unspecified. The password will be converted to a hash and stored to identify the user. As far as I know there isn't much risk in an insecure password here since this user can only access and modify tables on this localhost.\nNow that this user is created exit with exit or quit commands, and login as this user.\nquit\nmysql -u [username] -p\n<enter password>\nUSE [databasename];\n\nNow you'll want to setup your table, for this you'll want to have a good read on SQL, w3schools do a great tutorial\nCode with JDBC\nNow for the fun part - the Java code.\nSetting up the project is fairly simple, open up a new project as you'd normally do. Add the mysql connector jar to the project files and add it to the build jars (in eclipse put the jar in your folder within the workspace, right click on the project, properties, then select \"Java Build path\", add jars or add externel jars and navigate to the MySQL connector jar.\nI wont describe using the JDBC in depth since the tutorial on the MySQL development site is fairly comprehensive.\nThese are the basics though:\nprivate Connection openConnection(String url, String user, String password) {\n    Properties properties = new Properties();\n    properties.put(\"user\", user);\n    properties.put(\"password\", password);\n    properties.put(\"characterEncoding\", \"UTF-8\");\n    properties.put(\"useUnicode\", \"true\");\n\n    Connection c;\n    try {\n        //Class.forName(\"com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\").newInstance();\n        c = DriverManager.getConnection(url, properties);\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n        return null;\n    }\n\n    return c;\n}\n\n...\n\nClass.forName(\"com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\").newInstance();\nConnection sqlCon = openSQLCon(\"jdbc:mysql://[mysqlhost]:3306/[databasename]\", \"[username]\", \"[password]\");\n\nStatement st = sqlCon.createStatement();\nst.execute(\"SQL STATEMENT\");\n\nsqlCon.close();\n\nThis will connect to the MySQL database given previously mentioned values (username, database, password, and the host will be the host machine of the MySQL server. Also to note that 3306 is just the default port for MySQL and so might be different if you set it so.) It will then execute the \"SQL STATEMENT\" and close the database. You will need to catch exceptions, and of course handle results sets. You will need to import several thing from \"java.sql\", and also \"java.util.Properties\". Information on all of this is in the JDBC docs.\nYou should spend some time reading the tutorials with JDBC and MySQL, and play around with them.

When the power supply got too loud, I decided to move the harddrive to a desktop box. However, when I tried to boot up, the screen tells me to pick a cd drive (even though I set hard drive as the first option in the boot order in the bios settings). I luckily have an Ubuntu cd so I was able to boot into that. One of the options there is to boot from hard disk and that works fine. So how do I get machine to boot from the hard disk?\nPotentially useful pieces of info:\nThe desktop was purchased around 2007. The easy store was purchased in 2011.

Check your partition table. If you've got a smallish FAT partition at the start that shows in GParted or parted as having its \"boot flag\" set, or that gdisk shows as having a type code of EF00, then that's an EFI System Partition (ESP). Check it for files. If there's a directory called EFI/ubuntu with a file whose name ends in .efi (such as grub.efi or grubx64.efi), then this supports my hypothesis.\nIf I'm right, you can fix it by booting the hard disk using the circuitous path you've chosen, creating a small (~1MiB) BIOS Boot Partition, uninstalling the grub-efi package, installing the grub-pc package, and running sudo update-grub. This should set up a BIOS-mode boot loader on the disk. Note, however, that if you subsequently move the disk back to the newer computer, it may fail until you reverse the process and re-install either grub-efi or another EFI-mode boot loader.\n", "Q: How to make my Windows software run on Linux?

Is this dialog always displayed? How can I differentiate between when this dialog is appropriate and when it isn't?\n\nA: It is normal to get this dialogue when using thunar, as noted here briefly at the Xfce wiki, although it will obviously only be displayed if you have a notification daemon installed. When a filesystem is unmounted any pending data is written and then the device itself can be removed. However, sometimes the filesystem cannot be unmounted if a process is still attached, and so tools like fuser can be used to check what is still accessing the drive.\nThe addon, thunar-volman is installed with thunar, and via thunar-volman-settings, you can configure how it operates. As it uses dbus to communicate with other applications, you can get a glimpse of what's happening behind the scenes, by running\ndbus-monitor\n\nand then connect your device, and then unmount it. A whole splurge of data will arrive, but you can see the process whereby thunar, thunar-volman, etc are communicating over dbus, resulting in what you see when you remove a device, which is communicated to you by your installed notification-daemon:\nmethod call sender=:1.97 -> dest=:1.98 serial=8 path=/org/freedesktop/Notifications; interface=org.freedesktop.Notifications; member=Notify\n   string \"Thunar\"\n   uint32 0\n   string \"drive-removable-media-usb\"\n   string \"Writing data to device\"\n   string \"There is data that needs to be written to the device \"MCADisc\" before it can be removed.

Because the basic execution flow of sudo becomes something very similar to this:\n\n\n*\n\n*The shell spawns off a subprocess to run sudo with the given parameters\n\n*sudo authenticates the user and confirms their right to execute the specified command\n\n*sudo spawns off a subprocess to execute the specified command\n\n*sudo waits for the subprocess spawned off in step 3 to exit\n\n*sudo exits, returning to the shell\n\n*The subprocess spawed in step 1 exits, returning the user to the shell prompt\n\n\n(This may be technically slightly incorrect; there is a system call which actually replaces the running process with a new one (that's the C library's execve()). However, for the purposes of this explanation, the two are equivalent.)\nThis becomes important when you consider that the current working directory is a property of each process and is inherited but not promoted. So if process A spawns off a new process B, then process B starts with the same working directory that process A was in. (This is why something as mundane as ls ./ does what you'd expect.) But if process B changes its working directory, then unless process A goes out of its way looking for that, A is completely unaware of that change. (This, in turn, is why if you run something like find / and abort it half-way through, you don't end up in some seemingly random location in the file system just because find happened to be looking there at the moment it was aborted.)\nSo even if sudo cd /somewhere did exactly what it says on the tin, by the time sudo exits, you are brought right back where you started. Hence effectively from the point of view of the user, it becomes a no-op. The fact that cd, while it was executing, called the chdir() system library function to set a new working directory, doesn't help you, the user.\nAs Warren Hill pointed out, the proper solution (I actually wouldn't call it a workaround) is to use sudo -i which drops you to a root shell where you can navigate around the filesystem freely and execute whatever commands you feel like. Do note however that when you exit this shell, you are still brought right back where you started in the directory hierarchy for exactly the same reason as I described above.\n", "Q: I got a General Protection Fault while transferring files SO I was transferring files from one portable hard disk to another (I had two of them connected to the laptop and suddenly the whole thing crashed.

I have a dual boot system with Ubuntu 13.04 and Windows 8 in perfect harmony. I have installed in windows an application so that I can mount the home (ext4) partition in windows. I am using Windows 8 only for DJ and audio production purposes, with Traktor and Ableton installed. \nI am using Dropbox and Ubuntu One so I want to sync my Dropbox and Ubuntu One files that I have uploaded to cloud from both systems. If I am in windows then the music of my home partition will be synced from Ubuntu One. Is that possible? What should I do?\n\nA: I would stick with one service, either user Ubuntu One or Dropbox. Honestly I would recommend dropbox, but that is just me. If you want to have both synced and a folder on each system synced then you can use \"the linking trick\".\nIn linux:\nln ~/Dropbox/music ~/synced_music\nThen add ~/synced_music to Ubuntu One\nIn Windows:\nYour basically going to do the same thing Making links in windows may help.\nMKLINK /J Dropbox/music C:\\wherever\\synced_music\nThen link again for the Ubuntu One side\nMKLINK /J \"Ubuntu One\\synced_music\" \"C:\\wherever\\synced_music\"\nNotes\nThis will keep the files in sync between Ubuntu One, Dropbox, Liunx, and Windows. However this is pretty silly. You would be far better off choosing either Dropbox or Ubuntu One, and just keeping it in sync. I prefer dropbox for my own reasons but Ubuntu One should work just fine. You can use the link trick with just one service. I use it all the time to keep my game saves shared between computers. \n\nA: Here's how I made Dropbox stay in my windows partition, but sync even when I'm in ubuntu, when I'm using windows/ubuntu dual boot.\nStep 0:\nBoot into Ubuntu.\nStep 1:\nUnlink your (Ubuntu) computer from Dropbox (in Ubuntu only).\nStep 2:\nGo to the Dropbox folder in windows partition. Rename it to dropbox2.\nStep 3:\nLink your (Ubuntu) computer to Dropbox.\nStep 4:\nPause syncing.\nStep 5:\nDelete the Dropbox folder, and rename dropbox2 to Dropbox.\nStep 6:\nResume syncing.\n\nA: You can use Ubuntu One for Windows. Download it here.\nUbuntu One makes it easy to back up, sync and access your files, folders, photos and music from anywhere. And from Windows as well.\nSimply select which folders you want to sync to your personal cloud by adding them to the sync list. Ubuntu One will take care of the rest.\n\nRead How do I setup Ubuntu One on Windows? to find out more.\n\nA: I think what you are saying is that you want to be able to put your files into the same folder from either system and have them be uploaded to your cloud regardless of which system is running. You can install Ubuntu One on Windows as this answer describes, but syncing the same folder from both systems is a little more difficult.\nThis would require one of your systems to set up Ubuntu One to sync a folder that is not in your actual home folder for that system (since it would be on the partition for your other system). Unfortunately, the FAQ says this does not work.\nHowever, one thing you could try doing (I haven't done this myself), is keeping your files in the Windows home folder and specially mounting that folder in Ubuntu according to this answer.\n\nA: How to set up Ubuntu One on both Ubuntu and Windows?\n\nIf I am in windows then the music of my home partition will be synced\nfrom Ubuntu One. Is that possible?\n\nIt is possible! Even more, it is the very principle of cloud synchronization. It is why services like dropbox and Ubuntu One were developed.\nIn contrast to your tool that allows you to read the data from your ext4 partition, though, cloud synchronizing different thing. In essence, it is serial. Let me explain:\n\n*\n\n*Computer A (Ubuntu) uploads a file to 'the cloud' when computer A is online.\n\n*Computer B (Windows) downloads that file from 'the cloud' when computer B is online and uploads new files to 'the cloud.'\n\n*When Computer A in online it checks whether it should download new files or upload new ones.\n\n*...\n\nThe cloud is the intermediary. That means that if you choose your files will be on all your computers and on the cloud. Do not think that a service like Ubuntu One or Dropbox actually goes and fetches a file from your other computer or partition, no it retrieves the copy of the file which is in the cloud. That means that all music files you choose will be in the cloud and in your Ubuntu partition and in your Windows partition. Note that this serialization is versatile. You can have both computers open and work on different files and they will sync to both computers.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nThe easiest thing to do is to install Ubuntu One in Windows (https://one.ubuntu.com/downloads/windows/install/). In Ubuntu it normally comes preinstalled.\n\n*\n\n*Make an account on Ubuntu (if you don't have one yet) and select the folders in Ubuntu you want to be part of your cloud.\n\n*Let Ubuntu One upload your files to the cloud.\n\n*Install Ubuntu One on your windows boot.\n\n*Login in with the same account you use on Ubuntu and select the music folder you want to synchronize. That folder will now be put in your Windows User folder.\n\n*Enjoy.\n\nIf you want to synchronize music you might want to buy some extra space for Ubuntu One.\nNOTE: Reading your ext4 partition from windows can be dangerous in the sense that malicious windows software could gain access to your ext4 partition.\n\nA: It is possible on both, Ubuntu One and Dropbox. I have found UbuntuOne some little troubles on Windows, but no problems at all with Drobox, therefore I prefer Dropbox. Choice is up to you. \nNegative for the synching is that it cost some time until a big file is synched, or it is not feasible when you are without connection. \nI personally defined a separate FAT partition on the HDD for such transfers, which is readable from both systems perfectly. And who cares about user rights on temporary files?\nBut did you try to run Traktor in Wine? it should work: http://www.native-instruments.com/forum/showthread.php?t=112551 Same with Ableton, it should work: http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=2113\nGive it a try.

What am I doing wrong? Thank you very much.\n\nA: /dev/sdb represents the whole storage device. The individual partitions are addressed by numbers following the device name, e.g. sdb1 is the 1st partition in the storage device sdb. As USB flash drives usually have only one partition, the mount command should be:\nmount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb\n\n\nA: sda or sdb is just the name of your storage device, if you want to mount it you must enter the partition number too.\nmkdir -p /media/usb\nmount /dev/sdb1 /media/usb\n\n\nA: Since this is among the top results I want to share some insight about what happened to me and how I solved it.\nMy situation is that I'm booting the 18.04 di-based server installer and I want to mount another (virtual) optical disc drive. Which gave me this exact error message.\nObservation:\n\n*\n\n*I'm in a busybox shell, which may behave different than GNU tools.\n\n*I have a different, limited kernel running. While the error message gave no indication and all arguments seemed to be correct I tried loading the filesystem module, iso9660 in my case, with modprobe. Then it worked. So whatever filesystem you are trying to mount, you should check (lsmod?) that the respective filesystem module is loaded to. It's unlikely that the OP was on busybox, but hey questions with not enough context are common and we are trying to solve them.\n\n", "Q: How Can I Run Ubuntu via my VM? I'm trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 to run in VirtualBox alongside my Win7 64bit OS, without having to dual-boot.\nI added the 64-bit Ubuntu iso to my VM, and powered it up so to proceed with the installation, but it prompted me with this error:\n\nThis kernel requires an x86-64 CPU, but only detected an i686 CPU.\n  Unable to boot - please use a kernel appropriate for your CPU.\n\nWhy does it give me this error, seeing as I have a 64bit processor? Is there a way that I can run Ubuntu via my VM in the first place?\n\nA: When creating a VM using VirtualBox, the first screen you are presented with asks for the name of your new VM and attempts to auto-detect which operating system you're installing. Make sure that you select Ubuntu (64 bit) in the OS drop-down menu. Just selecting Ubuntu in that menu will result in the error you have described.\n\n", "Q: Why does Empathy ask for permission to access my remote accounts? In order to let Empathy work, Ubuntu asks permission to collect information about me. Why is it that when I choose that I do not want Ubuntu to collect information about me, Empathy does not work?\nIn Fedora and OpenSUSE I do not have this problem!\n\nA: There isn't anything collecting information about you, empathy uses online accounts integration to provide the credentials necessary to login to those services.  It isn't really different than with the earlier versions of empathy where you gave empathy your login information directly.  Now when you setup the account, you can also choose to let other applications use the same credentials.  For example, if you add your google account, you can allow empathy and evolution to use it for IM and email.\nThe account information you add stays on your local system, and not shared elsewhere.\n", "Q: How to make an already live Ubuntu pen-drive, a persistent one? I have created a USB flash drive with the latest Ubuntu version, but it is not persistent.\nHow can I make it persistent without repeating the whole process?\n\nA: 2017\nPersistent partitions have not worked in syslinux Live Ubuntu systems since 14.04. This includes SDC, UNetbootin, Rufus etc.\nIf you really want to make an existing install persistent, you can build a casper-rw file in Windows and add it to the root of your flash drive, see https://www.pendrivelinux.com/casper-rw-creator-make-a-persistent-file-from-windows/\nThe casper-rw file will be limited to 4GB and only works on a FAT32 partition.\nIf you want the boot to be persistent press Shift, select language, press F6, hit Enter and type persistent, (For UNetbootin press Tab then F6)\nif you want every session to be persistent, modify isolinux/txt.cfg as Danatela shows above (or for UNetbootin install modify syslinux.cfg the same way).\nProbably easier to re-make the persistent drive using mkusb, it makes persistent partitions automatically.\n\nA: Changing Live Pendrive to Persistent Pendrive\nThat works with both BIOS and UEFI\nMany people prefer a Persistent pendrive that will save changes.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a Live pendrive using Rufus or similar.\n\n*Boot the pendrive toram to make the drive editable, (press shift when booting, press Esc from language, press F6, press Esc, type {space}toram after \"quiet splash ---\", and press Enter.\n\n*Create a casper-rw file: \nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=casper-rw bs=1M count=512\nsudo mkfs.ext3 -L casper-rw -F casper-rw\n(where count=512 is persistence size, with max 4GB).\n\n\n*\n\n*Move the new casper-rw file from home to the root of the Live Pendrive.\n\n*Edit /isolinux/txt.cfg, (for BIOS boot persistence) and /boot/grub/grub.cfg, (for UEFI boot persistence), add a space and the word \"persistent\" after \"quiet splash ---\".\n\n*Shut down and reboot the persistent drive.\n\nA: As shown in this guide, you can reduce size of FAT32 partition on your flash drive then make ext4 partition labeled casper-rw and it will be treaten as persistence file. If Gparted fails to reduce the size of FAT32 partition, you can do it in Windows program EaseUS Partition Master. \nIt seems to me that you can also create file named casper-rw and create ext filesystem in it with mke2fs -t extX /path/to/casper-rw so it will be persistence file too.\nAlso, you need to change isolinux/txt.cfg adding word persistent to boot options like this:\n\ndefault live\nlabel live\n  menu label ^Try Ubuntu without installing\n  kernel /casper/vmlinuz.efi\n  append  file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper cdrom-detect/try-usb=true persistent noprompt floppy.allowed_drive_mask=0 ignore_uuid initrd=/casper/initrd.lz quiet splash --\nlabel live-install\n  menu label ^Install Ubuntu\n  kernel /casper/vmlinuz.efi\n  append  file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper only-ubiquity cdrom-detect/try-usb=true persistent noprompt floppy.allowed_drive_mask=0 ignore_uuid initrd=/casper/initrd.lz quiet splash --\nlabel check\n  menu label ^Check disc for defects\n  kernel /casper/vmlinuz.efi\n  append  boot=casper integrity-check cdrom-detect/try-usb=true persistent noprompt floppy.allowed_drive_mask=0 ignore_uuid initrd=/casper/initrd.lz quiet splash --\nlabel memtest\n  menu label Test ^memory\n  kernel /install/mt86plus\nlabel hd\n  menu label ^Boot from first hard disk\n  localboot 0x80\n\n\nA: I am not aware of any way to do this. You would have to just reformat the usb, and reinstall the os back on to it with persistence enabled. I use Pendrivelinux to install a live os onto a pendrive with persistence. It should be relatively easy to do. Hope that works.\n", "Q: Installing CUDA toolkit I am trying to set up my computer for CUDA development as per this instruction.

Also, please read How do I open specific applications on specific workspaces in Lubuntu 13.04 in which I've covered other essential aspects (and omitted here).\nIn brief, you need to create a subsection in the applications section of ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml for Thunderbird. The subsection would look like this:\n<application name=\"...\" class=\"...\">\n  <iconic>yes</iconic>\n</application>\n\nI'm purposely not being specific about ... because I don't have Thunderbird installed. But, you should be able to figure out what has to be inserted in place of both occurrences of ... after you read about xprop in the linked answer. If the solution works for you, could you please come back and post the exact contents you use?\nHere is code that makes gedit and Firefox open \"iconic\" which is the term Openbox uses to describe apps in a minimized state:  \n<application name=\"gedit\" class=\"Gedit\">\n  <iconic>yes</iconic>\n</application>\n\n<application name=\"Navigator\" class=\"Firefox\">\n  <iconic>yes</iconic>\n</application>\n\n\nIf you're interested in using lubuntu-rc.xml further, also look at Launching Windows Maximized and the section that follows.\nCaveat: this procedure may not work for everything!

Just curious:\n \nAs you can see, after the \"launch web browser\", the shortcut is set to \"WWW\" by default.\nI know I can change it, but I'm just curious why it is \"WWW\"? And how should I press \"WWW\"?  \nThanks.\n\nA: There are several special keyboards that bring Multimedia Keys, specially Application Keys, which include keys that have the Logo for Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Thunderbird and even... yes... Internet Explorer. When pressed, they open the app assigned to it. In Ubuntu of course this would open the Libreoffice Apps (Calc, Writer, Impress, Firefox, Thunderbird...).\nThe key that has the \"Browser\" logo, is known as the WWW key or WEB key because it opens your computer to the World Weird Web. If you keyboard has it, it will open the browser that you have set as default. Firefox is the one that comes by default but you can change this in the System Settings. Here are some images of how the key looks:\n\n\nIf you do not have the WWW Key, then it will simply not work. You would need to reassign the key to another value. Same thing for Volume Control, where it has Volume Down/Up, Pause and Play assign to other keys not available on my keyboard, so I need to reassign them. Here is how it looks for me on a keyboard that has no multimedia or special keys:\n\nWith this I can use CTRL with the combination of a Numeric Key (The +, -, /, * signs) and I can control the volume and any music player.\n", "Q: can i install ubuntu from an external hard drive/ can i run fedora and ubuntu together on one system? hi i am a totaly new user of ubuntu. i have recently built a new system and want to install ubuntu 13.04, i have downloaded onto an external usb hard drive from a windows system that is running XP. my question is this, if i turn on my new system that is running a blank hard drive but the external hard drive with ubuntu saved on it is plugged in will the computer recognise it and load it. i have used the normal download of the iso instead of opting to create a live usb, was this the right way to go.\nmy next question is i know i can use ubuntu along side windows os but can i run ubuntu along side fedora linux with ubuntu as a dual operating system instead of windows as a dual OS system?\n\nA: You need create a live usb from the Ubuntu.iso\nYou can install and boot as many OS as you wish limited by hard drive space, so, yes you can dual boot Ubuntu and Fedora.\nI suggest you run both Ubuntu and Fedora live for a while and see which you prefer.

In the past I used to search for a package specifying a part of its name in Synaptic, as far as I can remember. Now it searches in package descriptions too and this is very inconvenient as it gives a huge lot of irrelevant results. I have tried using console aptitude and apt-cache search but both of them do the same. So how do I search in the names only (ignoring the descriptions)?\n\nA: With apt-cache, you can use the --names-only switch with your search term, and/or use some regex to narrow the searches down. Some examples I have used are listed below.\n1) Using --names-only with a simple search of the word launcher cuts out a lot of results:\napt-cache search launcher --names-only\n\nOften when using regex in your searches, --names-only isn't necessary as well, since you narrow the results down much further anyway, as these examples below demonstrate.\n2) You could use regex to find all available desktop environments available:\napt-cache search -- '-desktop$'\n\n3) or to find dev files that you don't know the name of:\napt-cache search 'jpeg*-dev'\n\nThe methods shown in the examples above are very useful when using apt-cache to search for packages for which you only partially know the name.\n", "Q: meaning of this ps aux output I was not sure if I am running named.

AND I think that is the real issue. Efforts to create user fail after reboot.  Nothing seems to be saved/written to the casper-rw file.\nThere are 9 items in the syslinux.cfg, Grub shows 4...\n\nA: If you are on a secure/uefi boot machine, you are possibly experiencing bug 1159016.  The uefi machines use grub instead of syslinux, so the workaound until a fix is made is to edit the stick/s /boot/grub/grub.cfg and add the word \"persistent\" to the kernel lines.\n\nA: This doesn't really fit into the scope of my previous answer, so I'm making a new one.\nOK, so you use Unetbootin to create your USB stick. Looking at your syslinux.conf it looks kind of mangled, yet you said you could get into a working Ubuntu.\nWell, to get rid of the extra variables added by using Unetbootin, etc. to make a disk, we're going to do the real way of creating a BootUSB.\nSince late 2010, Ubuntu has been shipping as what is called a \"Hybrid ISO.\" A hyrid ISO is a hybrid between a HDD image and a CD image. Basically, it's a CD ROM with a 512-btye bootloader at the beginning so that it can be booted as a hard drive as well.\nWhat does this mean for you? This means that you can directly copy the CD image onto the USB drive and have yourself a fully bootable Ubuntu USB drive.\nNOTE: Using dd to create a disk will erase everything on it. Back up anything you want to save (and your casper-rw file, since it doesn't exist on the CD)!\n\nWindows:\nEDIT: There is actually an easier method to do this, that is much less technical. You could simply download the Win32 Disk Imager, which was made by Ubuntu developers to do the same thing that dd for Windows does, just in a much simpler fashion. It's pretty intuitive. If you opt to go that route, just download it from the link provided and skip to the last section.\nWindows doesn't have the native capability to directly copy a file to a hard drive like we need to, so the first thing you need to do is to download dd for Windows (I used version 0.5 for my tests).\nTo ensure the safety of your HDD, you should rename the file from dd.exe to dd-removable.exe. This will make sure that dd will only work on removable disks.\nMoving on, you first need to figure out which drive you are going to be copying the image to.\nFirst, open up a command prompt Ctrl+R, enter \"cmd\" and press enter.\nFrom here you want to cd into the directory that you saved the dd program under. For me, this was Desktop. For you, this might be Downloads.\ncd Desktop\n\nNow, you want DD to give you a list of all the devices\ndd --list\n\nThis will print out a list of all devices. You're looking for one that says \"Removable media.\" (I believe, my VM test case still shows it as a fixed disk which shouldn't be the case).\nOf all the entries that say \"Removable media.\", you want to find the one that is the same size of your hard drive. This might be a bit difficult as it is in bytes, but the general formula is 1 billion per 1 gigabyte. It's no guarantee, but it should be the last one in the list.\nOnce you have located which disk number your had drive is, you'll want to go ahead and copy the file to the USB disk! You will run a command similar to this:\ndd if=C:\\path\\to\\ubuntu\\ISO of=\\\\?\\Harddisk2\\Partition0\n\nIt's important to note that it is always Partition0, the variable here is which \"Harddisk\" number to use. In my case, I had one virtual booting hard drive (which should be Harddisk1 by default), and had one USB virtual disk which ended up being Harddisk1.\n\nLinux:\nFirst determine your flash drive's device name:\nmount\nIn the list you should see something that says something such as /media/????-???? each '?' is a number or letter from A-F. If you have more than one of these, the CD to /media and figure out which one has the files from your USB. If it's 0000-FFFF, then look for that entry in the mount command. It should say something like \"/dev/sdb1 mounted on /media/0000-FFFF\". The important thing to note here is the \"/dev/sdb1\"\nSo, if the output you get is \"/dev/sdb1\", then the drive device is /dev/sdb -- simply remove the number off the end. \nBe sure you do your backups as noted above before running the next commands.\nsudo umount /dev/sdb1 #unmount your flash drive\nsudo dd if=/path/to/ubuntu/iso of=/dev/sdb #write the file to the flash drive\n\n\nBoth:\nOnce the command completes you should have a bootable Ubuntu without all the extra stuff added by Unetbootin or whatever program. It's a pure Ubuntu disk as if it had been done off a CD-ROM.\nBefore you put your backed-up files back on, you're going to need to resize the partition by using the Windows Disk Utility (under the Adminitrative Tools->Computer Management in the control panel) or Gparted.\nOnce you have your functioning disk, you can then edit /boot/grub/menu.cnf and (I believe it is) /isolinux/txt.cfg and append the \"persist\" option and drop your backed-up casper-rw into the root of the drive.\n\nA: I've made many, many live customizations to Ubuntu, granted it's been a while. I remember the day when you had to set up persistence manually. \n\n\n*\n\n*I see you have the persistent kernel option, that's the first step. Just to be safe, you should also add persistent to the other boot entries (other than \"Memory Test\" and \"Boot from first hard disk\").\n\n*You should be using a FAT-based file system for your USB disk.\n\n*The file that is persistent has to be named casper-rw and has to exist on the root of the drive\n\n\nIf you have no such casper-rw file, then that's your problem. I will guide you through creating one through the Ubuntu LiveUSB itself.\nFirst thing is, when you boot the LiveUSB and get to the desktop, open a terminal and type\nmount -o remount,rw /cdrom #(/cdrom is actually your USB disk when using a USB).\n\nSince FAT-based filesystems can't create sparse files, we're going to have to wait on dd to make a full 4GB file:\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/cdrom/casper-rw bs=1M count=4096\n\nThis will make a 4 gig (or close enough, not sure if dd uses binary or decimal notation for Megs) file called casper-rw on the root of your drive.\nThe final step is to make an ext2 filesystem within this file. Fancy!\nmkfs.ext2 -F /cdrom/casper-rw\n\nNow, when you reboot you should boot into a working and persistent live USB installation.\nEDIT: In response to my below comment, it appears that nothing has changed regarding loading the persistence file. The only caveat is that for it to work it MUST be at the root of a FAT filesystem (that is, the filesystem has to be loaded with the vfat driver. This means FAT16, or FAT32). To my knowledge exFAT will not work.\nEDIT 2: Just researched exFAT linux support. Currently, exFAT needs to be mounted using a FUSE extension, and is not supported by the vfat driver, so it will not work.\nEDIT 3: OK, so you do have the casper-rw. Intriguing. So, somewhere along the line it is not booting with the persistent option. Now, I know that it used to be when you saw the icon for the guy with a keyboard under him you had to hit a key. Otherwise, it would boot with the \"maybe-ubquity\" kernel option. However, I'm not sure where the splash scree was getting the rest of its boot flags from (it's written in PostScript for gfxboot. Utterly horrible to try to decipher), if it was at all. So, not pressing any key when it boots up may invalidate changes you've made to grub.cnf or syslinux.conf.\nEDIT 4: I'm going through the gfxboot-theme-ubuntu code right now, and it appears that it pulls all of its command lines directly from syslinux.conf -- even if it exists in root. However, which syslinux.conf entry it appends \"maybe-uquity\" to and executes if no key is pressed is something that I'm still trying to decipher.\n\nA: I had this problem with 13.04 just now, and fixed it by editing boot/grub/grub.cfg and adding persistent to the commandline.\nI note in your post that you've added that keyword AFTER the --, which may be the problem there, since the -- means 'there are no more kernel options after this point'.  You can check the options that your kernel actually booted with by looking at the contents of /proc/cmdline\nSo instead of \"-- persistent\", try \"persistent --\".\nOne other thing I noticed is that when persistence is working (other than things surviving a reboot), the casper-rw file gets mounted, and shows up as a volume in unity on the left. \n", "Q: How to increase size of partition to take up unallocated space I have a Ubuntu installation(sda3) with unallocated space that I want to use to use to increase the space of sda5 on the following picture: \n\nThe only problem is I cant resize it, gparted says im already at the maximum size for that partition:\n\n\nA: Unallocated space needs to be contiguous to the partition to be resized.

file for OpenStack , by defining environment for OpenStack ?\nIn an attempt to fix above problem, I tried using a DNS server on another system instead of using /etc/hosts to resolve DNS names.  \nMy configured domain name on this new server is \"malik.net\". Name resolution works fine but juju assigns a different public address against each node's installed service. e.g juju-status reports: public-address: node-aab2ccddeeff.localdomain whereas it should be public-address: node-aab2ccddeeff.malik.net. \nThe nodes do not recognize the public address created by juju. Then I had to make entries in /etc/hosts at each node by writing node IP's and each_node_name.localdomain. I landed in the same relation error problem.\nBy telling Juju to use the right domain name might fix this issue, But i do not know how to do that .\n\nA: The nova-compute charm depends on DNS resolution of IP addresses; several functions within OpenStack rely on IP addresses instead of hostnames and the charm includes code that directly queries DNS to resolve hostnames -> IP addresses.\nUnfortunately using /etc/hosts on a stock cloud-init built instance will always result in a hostname -> IP address mapping to 127.0.1.1 - which is not much use other than for local access.\nI'd encourage you to get DNS up and running; I don't think its an insane assumption that DNS is functional in the charm execution environment.\n", "Q: USB External Hard drive unplugged but still shows up! I am running on Ubuntu 12.04. I have physically unplugged an external hard drive from my laptop, but for some reason it is still shown as mounted in Nautilus.

Thanks!!\n\nA: Try running the unmount command with root permissions from the CLI.\nOpen a Terminal window with alt+t or by searching for \"Terminal\" in Finder.\nGoing off the data you provided about the error, it looks like your HDD is mounted at '/media/My Passport'. To unmount it, run sudo umount \"/media/My Passport\". Enter your password when prompted.\nIf it is not mounted at /media/My Passport, type df and hit enter. A list of the mounted volumes on your system will be displayed. Find the one for your HDD (will likely say something about \"My Passport\", and the size will be what you expect). Note the last column of that output for your HDD (labeled \"Mounted on\"). Let's call it /path/to/hdd for this example.

However, I'd also like to keep using Gnome shell.\nHardware: Lenovo T430.\nOwn attempts\nI have tried\napt-get install gnome-shell gnome-session\n\nbut this brings along more than 100 extra packages, some of which I am not sure I really need.

You know you want audio stuff, and you know you want Shell. Options 1 and 2 are each only one step away, while option 3 is two steps away, let's forget about it and the cruft it brings.\n\n*Then deciding between 1 (Ubuntu GNOME) and 2 (UbuntuStudio) is also easy in your case, because you want Shell and audio stuff. Well,\n\n*\n\n*If you install UbuntuStudio, you will end up with XFCE, which you don't want\n\n*Just adding the ubuntustudio-audio ubuntustudio-audio-plugins linux-lowlatency metapackages will setup your lowlatency environment the same way than through a Studio install, without the additional Studio cruft (XFCE, additional video/etc. packages)\n\n\n\nFinally, regarding the login manager, with Ubuntu GNOME you'll end up with GDM, which (provided you like GNOME Shell) will be fine for you (simple, efficient) and is not better or worse than LightDM.\nTo wrap up:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu GNOME (images, wiki)\n\n*If you want to get the latest-and-greatest GNOME 3.8 hotness, add the official GNOME3 team PPA : sudo apt-add-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3, and do a sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.\nNote: Do not add the staging PPA, it is for developers and will make your environment unstable.\n\n*Install the ubuntustudio-audio ubuntustudio-audio-plugins linux-lowlatency metapackages\n\n*Jam :)\n\n\nA: To install gnome-shell (3.8) in any ubuntu flavor, open a new Terminal window and enter the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3\nsudo apt-get update \nsudo apt-get install gnome-shell\n\n", "Q: Hotkeys for Totem in Ubuntu 12.04 I'm looking for a way to control the playback of Totem Movie Player even when I'm not focused on the window itself.

I am a C++ Qt developer, but I don't use QML much, so there may be some way that I am not aware of.  \nMy understanding of QML is that it is primarily used for describing a UI for which any non-trivial backend code is implemented in either PyQt or C++.  Additionally, QML is meant to be completely cross-platform, and obtaining a User ID is not a platform agnostic operation.  \nIf I were you and I was set on not using C++, I might try asking this question on Stack Overflow.  There may be someone there with more expertise.\n\nA: Thanks to Amit Tomar for this answer:\nYou would have to get the Username in C++ and then exchange that data from C++ to qml. \nQML and C++ objects can communicate with one another through signals, slots and property modifications. For a C++ object, any data that is exposed to Qt's Meta-Object System - that is, properties, signals, slots and Q_INVOKABLE methods - become available to QML.

From my understanding X is started with startx, so I'm wondering why tty7 doesn't drop back to a prompt when X terminates.\nNote: my knowledge of X and display servers is relatively limited.\n\nA: As far as I know this is all just tradition. \"tty\" is just a historical hangover from mainframes. 1-6 exist as login prompts because that's how they're defined in /etc/default/console-setup (and executed by /etc/init/console-setup.conf). This is how those TTYs get their login prompts and by extension, why tty7 does not have one.\nBut why 6 text ttys? And why tty7 for graphics?

How can I fix it?\n\nA: I think you need to run the software-center using elevated credentials. Most Unixes use a tool called sudo to give users the ability to do this, without having to give them the root password. \nTry this command:\nsudo software-center\n\nYou'll be prompted for a password, this is your normal user's password. It's just re-authenticated you to make sure you're not someone that just happen to sit down at someone else's terminal.\nYou can read more about the sudo command if you're interested.\nReferences\n\n\n*\n\n*getting started with sudo tutorial\n\nA: Try updating from the terminal\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nIt would be working.\n", "Q: apt-get and dependencies I thought apt-get was a package manager that installs all dependencies by default when it installs an application. But when I tried installing gcc-4.7, I get this:\n sudo apt-get install gcc-4.7\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information... Done\nYou might want to run 'apt-get -f install' to correct these:\nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n gcc-4.7 : Depends: cpp-4.7 (= 4.7.3-2ubuntu1~12.04) but it is not going to be installed\n           Depends: libgcc-4.7-dev (= 4.7.3-2ubuntu1~12.04) but it is not going to be installed\n libstdc++6-4.7-dev : Depends: libgcc-4.7-dev (= 4.7.3-2ubuntu1~12.04) but it is not going to be installed\n\nWhy didnt it install the \"unmet dependencies\"?\n\nA: There is a possibility that if they were installed they would conflict with something else. Or, maybe something is messed up in your software configuration. What I would do first is use the apt-get -f install command like the prompt tells you to, and then try installing again.\nIf that doesn't work try using aptitude to install gcc. Aptitude usually is able to fix problems automatically when apt-get can't. (As you have just found out) Just install it using:\n# apt-get install aptitude\n\nAnd then just use it like you would use apt-get:\n# aptitude install gcc-4.7\n\nYou may also want to use aptitude to update your packages and upgrade if the previous command doesn't work:\n# aptitude update\n# aptitude upgrade\n\n", "Q: Sharing Evolution Mail local folders Is it possible to share the local folders from one Evolution client to another? How? Thanks.\n\nA: According to your descriptions both clients are connected locally to the same storage, one using the internal harddisk and the other an attaches USB drive. Only one client is active at a time (never both at the same time), so simultaneous write-access should not happen.\nI cannot give any guarantees for the following, since I've never tried (and also will not try, at least in the nearer future), but using symbolic links, the following should be possible -- provided the userIDs (of the user on both machines) match.\nAssumptions:\nLet's call the machine with the \"internal disk\" local, and the one primarily using the USB disk external. On both machines, your user is willie. On local, your home directory such should be /home/willie, and let's assume the USB drive is mounted at /mnt/usbdrive with willie's external account such being at /mnt/usbdrive/home/willie when looking from local.\nSetting it up:\n\n*\n\n*make sure userIDs match: when logged in as \"willie\", on each machine at a shell prompt enter the command id. Output should start with uid=1000(willie) gid=1000(willie). Make sure uid on local matches uid on external, same for the gid. Otherwise you will certainly run into a permissions problem.\n\n*just in case: make a backup on local (on external, it cannot hurt either). You might want to run an export from Evolution, but at least do a cp -R ~/.local/share/evolution/mail/local ~/backup/mail_local while Evolution is shut down (of course, you might want to use a different target).\n\n*now remove the local mail on local: rm -rf ~/.local/share/evolution/mail/local\n\n*and create a symlink from the USB disk: ln -s /mnt/usbdrive/home/willie/.local/share/evolution/mail/local ~/.local/share/evolution/mail/local\nConclusion:\nThat should be it. For willie@external, nothing has changed -- so everything should still work as before. For willie@local things might be a little different: local mail now comes from the USB disk (if Evolution accepted the symlink). Provided local mail doesn't use any \"external configuration\" in ~/.config/evolution/mail, it should work. Hopefully, it uses only the symlinked directory (it certainly does for folder organization, as it saves its folder.db here).\nGood luck, and please report back! Though I do not intend to have use for this kind of solution in the near future, others might :)\n\nA: I tried many things, all failed,to connect my Evolutions. I'm a Windows convert who doesn't really get code.\nMy solution was to use the Backup/Restore feature.\nI backup the running machine to a shared network drive and close it.\nI start the other machine and Restore it from that shared drive.\nLimitations I found:\nIf you use the calendar, linking to external .ics files is problematic.\nImporting that data to a local calendar makes it part of the backup.\nThe same applies to address books.\nIt's manual, so it's inconvenient, but simple folk like me don't mind, so long as it works.

Power on your computer. Boot from the USB, as if you were going to install Ubuntu.\nStep 2\nWhen it loads up, choose \"Try Ubuntu\". This will open up Ubuntu for you. However, this is not the Ubuntu that you installed, it's just Ubuntu LiveCD, which is running from your USB.\nStep 3\nConnect to the internet.\nStep 4\nOpen up a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T). Type in the following and hit enter:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\n\nWhen it's done, type the following and hit enter:\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\n\nWhen it's done, a window should pop up, called the Boot Repair.\nStep 5\nHit \"Recommended Repair\" in the window that pops up. When it's done, note down the URL (paste.ubuntu.com/XXXXX). Then restart your computer (don't forget to remove the USB so that you don't boot from it again. I think at some point when restarting, it'll instruct you to remove it anyways).\nIf the above did not work, post that URL here so we can further assist you.\nAll the above information was taken from here.\n", "Q: Can I upgrade from Ubuntu 12.10 to Lubuntu 13.04 directly? I have  ubuntu 12.10 installed on mypc.\nI'm thinking to upgrade to 13.04.\nNow i'd like to take the opportunity also  to test lubuntu.\nShould I first upgrade ubuntu, then install lubuntu or  can I directly run the:\n\nsudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nIn other words,Will I get Lubuntu 12.10 (my current os version) or lubuntu 13.04(last available)?\n\nA: Lubuntu desktop is layer over your Ubuntu. It is not a full Lubuntu experience. It will just install the apps and desktop environment of lubuntu. So your installation will contain all apps of lubuntu and standard ubuntu.\nSo installing lubuntu-desktop will not make it Lubuntu 13.04. It will be ubuntu 13.04 with lubuntu desktop. \nSo you can approach either way. Only thing is if you Upgrade to ubuntu 13.04 & then install lubuntu-desktop  you will save few MBs.\nAnother note: lubuntu-desktop  is a meta package. It actually contains what needs to be installed. Once installed, removing lubuntu-desktop will not remove the all the apps. So uninstallation will be not that easy.\n", "Q: cpu frequency stays at the top even with ondemand or powersave governors The fan goes lower but the /sys/devices...../cpuinfo_cur_freq and scaling_cur_freq list the highest frequency. core i5 can go down to 1.2Ghz according to cpuinfo but watching the time_in_state shows it middle-of-the-roading it, with time only growing at 2ghz.\nwhat do I do?

I'm a brand new user to Ubuntu and Linux for that matter. I just installed Ubuntu in a Dual-Boot setup and loaded all the updates I could get.\nDuring installation it asked me to set the partition sizes between Ubuntu and Windows Vista. However, it did not differentiate which partition was which on the screen when I set them, so I gave Ubuntu about 75% of my disk space (about 125GB compared to only 80 for Vista). I was aiming to give Ubuntu 80GB of space, and the rest to the Windows partition. However, I got them backwards and Ubuntu now commands the majority of space.\nIs there a way to reduce the partition size and give the majority back to the Windows partition? Can anyone point me in the right direction for giving the partitions the appropriate size also? 80GB was a guess, so that I had room to install apps. \nThanks.\n\nA: Yes, there is a way to resize your partitions. However, depending on the different partitions you have and their locations, it might be a long process to resize. Nonetheless, here's what you can do, and what I always do. This method uses a utility called GParted.\nBefore we begin, it is advisable that you take a backup of your data.\nStep 1\nBoot up from the USB/CD that you used to install Ubuntu, as if you were installing it from scratch. But instead of choosing to \"Install Ubuntu\", you'll choose \"Try Ubuntu\". This will boot into the Ubuntu on your USB/CD, not the one you installed. Connect to the internet, and install GParted. GParted is a utility that helps you partition disks. To install it, open up a terminal using Ctrl+Alt+T and then type:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gparted && gksu gparted &\n\nStep 2\nGParted should come up. My GParted looks like this:\n\nThe top right states the hard drive we're currently viewing. In my case, it's /dev/sda. In your case, it most probably will say the same thing, or something else like sdb instead of sda. If you have any other external hard disks or USB sticks connected to your computer, they will also be listed in that drop down menu. It is very important that you make sure you choose your internal hard disk from that drop down menu. To be on the safe side, disconnect any other USB device and refresh GParted by hitting Ctrl+R.\nNow, the list at the bottom shows the partitions in this hard disk. In my case, /dev/sda2 is my Window's partition, because it is of type ntfs, and it's fairly big in size (180 GB). My Ubuntu partition is the one that says type ext4, which is also the one that has a mount point of /. So, identify your Windows and Ubuntu partitions the way I did it.\nStep 3\nNow we do the resizing. It's as simple as right clicking on the partition and selecting \"Resize/Move\". Do that on your Ubuntu partition, and resize it. Don't worry, the resizing won't actually happen when you hit OK, it'll queue up all the operations so you can \"apply\" everything in the end. So what you're going to need to do is (1) resize your Ubuntu partition, (2) move the empty space so that it's after your Windows partition, and (3) resize your Windows partition and \"expand\" it to take over that empty space. Once you're done, take a look at the little diagram showing the partitions and make sure that everything looks okay; that there is no empty space lurking around. If you're satisfied...\nAs aforementioned, this process can take a LONG time. It's because of the resizing and moving of partitions around. It all depends on how big your partitions are, and how much space is being used. It once took me more than two hours to complete. But, it could only take you 20 minutes. If you want to, you can post a screenshot before applying so we can take a look at it. But again, if you're satisfied and willing to go forwards...\n...hit the check mark in GParted to start applying all of these actions. Once done, reboot, and remove the USB/CD, and boot normally into your desired OS.\n\nA: Warning:  When dealing with partiotion, something might accidently go wrong.  It is advisable that you have a complete backup of you system just in case.  To have a back up done you can use something like Clonezilla.\nTo accomplish your task once you get a backup, You can boot from the Ubuntu Live CD, choose try Ubuntu.  Once you get to the desktop you need to install Gparted.  To do that, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command below:\nsudo apt-get install gparted \n\nOnce installed you can run it, by typing sudo -i gparted at the prompt, and you should be able to re-size the partition.  \nNote: To re-size a partition, first make sure the partition is unmounted. \n", "Q: Dual boot Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.10 I can't boot into Windows 7 from GRUB, or can't boot into Linux from Windows 7\nI have 2 HDD, on 1 I have Windows 7 and on other I have Linux.

I have turned \"Secure Boot\" off and turned on \"Legacy Support\" in the settings. This laptop has UEFI and it always boots to Windows 8 rather than the GRUB menu. To boot Ubuntu, I have to go to \"select boot device\" and select the \"ubuntu\" option, which will take me to the GRUB menu.\nHow can I get it to boot into Ubuntu by default?\n\nA: I strongly suspect that you have not installed Ubuntu in BIOS mode. The reason I say this is that you report that your \"select boot device\" boot menu has an option called \"ubuntu.\" If you were booting Ubuntu in BIOS (aka CSM or legacy) mode, this wouldn't be the case; the option would say \"boot from HD\" or some such generic description, since the firmware would have no way of identifying the BIOS-mode OS as being Ubuntu. In an EFI-mode boot, though, this information is stored in NVRAM, and so is available to the EFI's boot manager.\nTo be sure of this, boot Ubuntu and look for a directory called /sys/firmware/efi. If it's present, you've installed and booted Ubuntu in EFI mode. If it's absent, you've probably booted in BIOS mode, although there are ways to make that directory disappear from an EFI-mode boot, so I can't be positive of that.\nIf I'm right, then something is preventing GRUB from turning up as the default boot loader. Chances are this is because of a bug in HP's firmware; I've heard of other HP computers that have the same problem. There are quite a few possible workarounds. I recommend you try these two, in order:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot to Windows and open an Administrator Command Prompt window. Type bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi. If this works, GRUB will come up the next time you boot. (Note that you should type {bootmgr} in exactly that way; I'm not trying to denote a variable with the curly braces.)\n\n*In Linux, run the Boot Repair tool. This will do some juggling of boot files, which should make GRUB come up by default. Note that this approach is rather heavy-handed and the change may be undone by Windows -- very likely after certain system updates, and some users have reported after every boot. Still, this method often works for extended periods.\n\n\nIf neither of these approaches works, post back, along with the output of sudo efibootmgr -v and df -h /boot/efi. This extra information will enable me to make additional suggestions.\n\nA: If you prefer to fix it from your ubuntu you can use the efibootmgr utility (as root) as partially described in this reply:\nefibootmgr -v\n\nto see a list of installed bootloaders and the Bootorder\nefibootmgr -o xxxx,yyyy,...\n\nto specify the BootOrder to use as default.\n", "Q: GRUB rescue error on installed Ubuntu 13.04 with my Windows 8 pro.

I've tried :\n\navconv -f alsa -i pulse recod.wav \n\n..but it doesn't capture anything.\nHave any idea?\nThanks!\n\nA: The syntax to invoke avconv is nicely explained in the manpage for avconv. From audio recordings the following options are available:\n-f: Force input or output file format.\n-i: input file name\nTo record from ALSA we need the format to be alsa, and the input depends on the device we record (usually this will be the defualt device). Then your command should be as follows:\navconv -f alsa -i default record.wav\n\nTo simply record from an ALSA device we may consider using the more basic command line tool arecord. This gives the following example command for a 10 second (-d) recording in cd quality (-f) in wav codec (-t):\narecord -d 10 -f cd -t wav -D copy record.wav\n\nTo be able to record from  an output sink, we may have to choose a duplex audio profile in \"Sound Settings --> Hardware\":\n\nUnfortunately In >= 13.04 the hardware configuration was removed from the sound settings. To have access to advanced device configurations we need to install and run pavucontrol . The duplex profile can then be selected in the Configuration tab:\n\n", "Q: lost HDD Space after reinstalling ubuntu I  had a 200GBS HDD i installed Ubuntu 12.10 over my win vista but it deleted all my windows partitions and data, so I used testdisk from the liveCD and recovered some of the important data not all, and I tried to use someone's advice by better recovering them through a windows application so I tried to reinstall windows but I couldn't so I reinstalled Ubuntu again, but this time the file system is showing 186.3GBS only which is also shown at Gparted while the first installation before recovering the files it showed 198GBS capacity, How can I get back this lost space?\nP.S. \nwhen I used TestDisk to recover the files, I recovered them (pressing C to copy) to the\nhome folder (/) then I transferred them to my USB stick, could this be the reason for the lost space like a hidden folder or something??\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo fdisk -l\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 200.0 GB, 200049647616 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 24321 cylinders, \n\ntotal 390721968 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size \n\n(minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x0006b252\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  \n\nSystem\n/dev/sda1   *        2048   143362047    71680000    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda2       143364064   229086899    \n\n42861418    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda3       229086905   390716864    80814980    f  W95 Ext'd (LBA)\n/dev/sda5       \n\n229086968   321251804    46082418+   7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda6       321251868   390716864    34732498+   7  \n\nHPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n\nDisk /dev/sdb: 4022 MB, 4022337024 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 489 cylinders, total 7856127 \n\nsectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size \n\n(minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x68626862\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  \n\nSystem\n/dev/sdb1   *          38     7839719     3919841    b  W95 FAT32\n\n\n\n\nA: Your drive and your partitions are perfectly fine.

I've seen pointers to the opengl registry: http://www.opengl.org/registry/  but the files do not appear to be there.\nI've also see reference that the files come in the nvidia drivers.  Of course, the drivers supposedly are pre-loaded on the distribution, but perhaps not the developer tools.\nIf anyone on Ubuntu is listening, this is kind of a ludicrous situation.  This is not wildly exotic stuff, loading the graphics libraries should be fast and easy.  In fact, I might venture to suggest that these header files be included with any standard developer headers.\nAnyway, I was trying to install the NVIDIA drivers with:\nsudo sh ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-260.19.12.run\nThis fails because the x server is running.

And it also tells you where to do this: /etc/samba/smb.conf.\nSee the section [global] in /etc/samba/smb.conf.\nIt will have 2 options named...\nnetbios name =\nworkgroup = \n\nThese need to be different. If they are empty the get defaulted. See for both these snippets from the Samba manual:\n\nnetbios name\nThe default value for this configuration option is the server's hostname—that is, the first part of its fully qualified domain name.\nChanging the NetBIOS name of the server is not recommended unless you have a good reason. One such reason might be if the hostname of the system is not unique because the LAN is divided over two or more DNS domains. For example, YORKVM1 is a good NetBIOS candidate for vm1.york.example.com to differentiate it from vm1.falkirk.example.com, which has the same hostname but resides in a different DNS domain.\n\nSource.\n\n\nworkgroup\nThe workgroup parameter sets the current workgroup (or domain) in which the Samba server will advertise itself. Clients that wish to access shares on the Samba server should be in the same NetBIOS group. Remember that workgroups are really just NetBIOS group names and must follow the standard NetBIOS naming conventions outlined in Chapter 1.\nThe default option for this parameter is set at compile time to WORKGROUP. Because this is the default workgroup name of every unconfigured Windows and Samba system, we recommend that you always set your workgroup name in the Samba configuration file. When choosing your workgroup name, try to avoid making it the same name as a server or user. This will avoid possible problems with WINS name resolution.\n\nSource.\n\n\nrlimit_max: increasing rlimit_max (1024) to minimum Windows limit (16384)\n\nAdd...\n* - nofile 16384\nroot - nofile 16384\n\nto /etc/security/limits.conf and reboot.\nIt is a warning, you can safely ignore it.

You can do that from Win7 by resizing the partition on the disk you wish to install Ubuntu. I wouldn't recommend doing it during the install. Then during the install you can select that \"unallocted space\" for the Ubuntu installation (or ubuntu does it on its own if you select the first options \"install alongside Windows 7\"). This is how I usually do it. Its safest.\n", "Q: Gnome-Control-Panel crashes while trying to access Online Accounts Running Ubuntu Gnome 13.04 x64.\nI set up Empathy with Facebook and Google Accounts, and I sent my PC to Standby, then it showed my FB Accounts was disconnected.\nCouldn't open Online Accounts (of Gnome) since then.\nWhen I start gnome-control-panel via Terminal, and go to Online Accounts, I get this:\nberyju@beryju-i3:~/.config$ gnome-control-center online-accounts\n**\nERROR:empathy-user-info.c:252:fill_contact_info_grid: assertion failed: (spec != NULL)\nAborted (core dumped)\n\n\nA: Try this workaround:\nIn order to overcome this I set my status to \"Offline\", after that I am able to manage accounts by pressing \"F4\" than I change my status back to \"Available\"\n(from https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-control-center-signon/+bug/1174936/comments/5)\n\nA: I solved it with \nsudo apt-get remove empathy shotwell\n#Add the account again\nsudo apt-get install empathy shotwell\n\n", "Q: Lingot is not working.

I split drink on my keyboard, all the keys work fine except for the enter key. \nSo i wanted to ask if the is any way I kind map it to a different key as I would or could do with Windows \nThanks for the help\n\nA: You need to have two app: xev and xmodmap, both are commandline-tool.\nRun xev. Then press the key whose behaviour you want to change. i.e. Enter. and then xev will output some information about the pressed key. Pay attention to the third line. It should be like this:\nstate 0x10, keycode 110 (keysym 0xff55, Prior), same_screen YES,\n\nIn this example Prior is the name of the behaviour the key is assigned to at the moment, the number keycode is the internal id to recognize the key. Now do this with another key i.e. PgDown give this output\nstate 0x10, keycode 115 (keysym 0xff56, Next), same_screen YES,\n\nHere again the interesting part for us is keycode 115 and Next. Now, when you want to swap the two keys use xmodmap.\n xmodmap -e \"keycode 110 = Next\"\n\nThis changes the key with keycode 110 on your keyboard to the action Next. It's pretty simple.\n\nA: How to press 'Enter' if the key does not work\nIf you are lucky to have a terminal open, press simultaneously Ctrl+Shift+U, then press Shift+A (uppercase A) to insert the Unicode for 'Enter'.\nOtherwise you will have to use an on-screen keyboard (there may be one installed as an Accessibility tool) or use an external keyboard.\nRemap key in X11 desktop\n\n\n*\n\n*Obtain the keycode of the key you want to remap by using the xev command.\nKeyRelease event, serial 34, synthetic NO, window 0x4a00001,\nroot 0xc5, subw 0x0, time 482692681, (-95,23), root:(499,342),\nstate 0x11, keycode 62 (keysym 0xffe2, Shift_R), same_screen YES,\nXLookupString gives 0 bytes: \nXFilterEvent returns: False\n\nExample output when pressing the right shift-key, which has keycode 62.\n\n*Remap the desired keycode to Return using the xmodmap command, e.g.:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode 62 = Return\"\n\nRemaps keycode 62 from Shift_R to Return.\n\n*When you are happy with your current keymap and want to use it in future X-sessions, run the following command to save it:\nxmodmap -pke > ~/.Xmodmap\n\nRemap key in native Linux console\n\n\n*\n\n*Kernel keycodes are different from X11 ones. I found this keycode table in a quick Google search. I would choose R Shift which has the kernel keycode 54.\n\n*Run the following command to dump your current keymap:\ndumpkeys > ~/keymap.dmp\n\n\n*Now, modify the dumped keymap: You need to copy the behaviour of keycode 28 to the new keycode, i.e. keycode 54 if you want to use right-shift. You can do this manually in a text editor or use the following commands (copies behaviour from keycode 28 to keycode 54):\nsed -n '/keycode *28 = /p' ~/keymap.dmp > ~/keymap.return\nsed -i 's/28 =/54 =/' ~/keymap.return\nsed -e '/keycode *54 = /!b;r '$HOME'/keymap.return' -e 'd' ~/keymap.dmp > ~/keymap.new\n\nYour new keymap is now in ~/keymap.new\n\n*Load your new keymap in the console (requires root access):\nsudo loadkeys ~/keymap.new\n\n\n*Happy about the result? On Ubuntu you can change the default keyboard settings in /etc/default/keyboard. Copy your modified keymap file to a safe location and find out how to load it automatically at startup, so you don't need to run loadkeys every time.\n\nA: Adding that line works for me.\n~/ tail -1 .tmux.conf\nrun-shell 'xmodmap -e \"keycode 104 = Return\"'\n\n", "Q: read /dev/ttyUSB0 failed?

I have a shiny new one which came with windows 8. I would like to put Ubuntu on it for dual boot.

(And put the fear into me).  Or, of course, point me in the direction of a fool-proof guide which works every time!\nThanks!\n\nA: No there are no such tool.\nNeed a worry free dual boot setup?\n\n\n*\n\n*Create restoration disk if your laptop guide said so, or you must have the windows 8 install media.

This changes the direction you slide your mouse into the next screen, but this works when the \"Sticky Edge\" and CompizConfig-System-Manager options do not.\nDrag and drop external monitor to the left side of the main monitor\nIt appears that the issue with the right side is the placement of the workspace navigator along the right edge of the main monitor. The workaround is to find the sweet spots above and below the navigator but that can be rather annoying to rely upon.\nNOTE: Applying this change to the left side of the monitor relinquishes any left-screen edge mouse controls such as the system search bar and the applications sidebar. However you still can access it via the \"Super\" button. But if you're using Gnome-Do or if you're a terminal wiz, this shouldn't be much of an issue.\n", "Q: How to unmount NFS when server is gone? I am mounting a NFS-folder from a server to my laptop.\nUnfortunately, the server goes off sometimes... The problem is, that I cannot unmount the \"dead\" NFS-folder.

Lets you move on with your life without waiting for the plumber to arrive.\n\nA: You can use umount -f -l /mnt/myfolder, and that will fix the problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*-f – Force unmount (in case of an unreachable NFS system). (Requires kernel 2.1.116 or later.)\n\n*-l – Lazy unmount. Detach the filesystem from the filesystem hierarchy now, and cleanup all references to the filesystem as soon as it is not busy anymore. (Requires kernel 2.4.11 or later.)\nSource:Linux Complete Command Reference\n\nA: In case umount -f -l /mnt/myfolder doesn't work service nfs restart (or it's equivalent on your linux) might.\n\nA: For me, neither umount, nor service restart will work. Just reboot. \nEven with a new system, NFS implementation seems to still have that old issue. So, just reboot.\n\nA: I noticed something when trying to unmount directories for NFS servers that go offline.\nMy first instinct is to unmount lowest subdirectories first and then work my way up to the top of the directory tree.  However, unmounting subdirectories by using --force and --lazy  failed and resulted in a long timeout.  What finally worked for me was when I used --force and --lazy at the top level, as in:\numount --lazy --force /net/machine\nDon't first try to unmount the lower directories, such as:\numount --lazy --force /net/machine/subdir\n", "Q: Ubuntu updating 13.04.

I started a download with win8 and paused it halfway.  Is there a way to resume the same download in Ubuntu? I have access to the physical file in my windows download folder. These are the files: \nubuntu-12.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso \nubuntu-12.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso.aria2\n\nA: Michael Tunnell from uGet:\nThis is an interesting question, I've never considered this option...it might be possible right now but it heavily depends on the kind of download...if downloading from a site like Mediafire then I highly doubt it because those sites use Session Cookies and you could possibly move the files over, the session cookie and add it to the queue via import but I highly doubt it would be successful because of the cookie issue.\nIf the download is a direct link to a file then it is possible as the session cookie wouldn't be needed.\nTo be honest, I am not sure - I will have to do some testing to see if this is possible.\n", "Q: Does the shortcut Ctrl-Alt-F... turn off the GUI or is it still running in the background? I am new to Linux and am planning on setting up a server.\nWhat I want to know is, when I use the CtrlAltF1 command to go back to the terminal does the GUI turn off until I use CtrlAltF7 again or does it just sit in the background like if you used Alt-Tab in Windows OS to switch between windows?\nThe reason I ask is as I am still learning I still need a GUI on hand until I get more used to terminal.\nI know there are commands to stop and start LightDM but I was just curious what the keyboard shortcuts mentioned above do to the GUI when switching between them.\n\nA: If you ever logged in with two users on the same machine or started gui on another tty1 with startx, you'd notice something like this:\n$ who                                                                          \nxieerqi  tty1         2015-07-31 22:17\nxieerqi  :0           2015-07-31 22:18 (:0)\nxieerqi  pts/7        2015-07-31 22:18 (:0)\n\nHere I have 3 logins - on tty1, on screen :0, and in gnome-terminal. With another user, it'd be reporting another display :1. So what's happening ? All the sessions are still active, GUI and tty are active at the same time. But switching between them makes linux switch who has control over keyboard (or more technically stdin device ) and screen (stdout) at the moment. \nNow, if I'd kill all my GUI sessions (sudo pkill unity), then GUI would be disabled temporarily. Or if I stopped lightdm because it's a parent process of GUI (because I logged in there). And of course it could be restarted. \nGUI is not disabled, in other-words, it just doesn't have control over keyboard and screen until you switch back with CtrlAltF7 or cycle through with AltL/R Arrow. \n\nA: When you switch to a \"virtual terminal\" by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F3 everything else remains as it was.

Of course, should doesn't always pan out in the real world.\nIn theory, you should (there's that word again) have been able to install Ubuntu 13.04 with Secure Boot enabled; since version 12.10 (including 12.04.2, but not 12.04), Ubuntu has supported Secure Boot. In practice, this doesn't always work, although I've not studied Ubuntu's Secure Boot problems in enough detail to know why. Certainly there's no need to enable Secure Boot for an update, though; there are plenty of EFI/UEFI systems that lack Secure Boot entirely, so it would be insane of the Ubuntu developers to require that Secure Boot be active in future updates. If you're booting with Secure Boot turned off, an update should still work with Secure Boot disabled.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04: why could it not read DVD?

Loading only under root I have an executable that requires a shared library that resides in /opt/... folder. I have included the path in LD_LIBRARY_PATH under /etc/environment and updated it using source /etc/environment. When I run this executable without root permissions, I get an error saying libxxx.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory. But when I run it with sudo, it runs. Though the problem is, the license is not under root user, therefore it throws an error regarding license. I changed the permission for /opt/... so that the normal user can create and delete files. Though, it does not help. What's wrong and how do I fix this? \n\nA: /etc/environment is interpreted during login. So the correct way to see the changes you made to /etc/environment is to logout and login again.\nsudo works because it partially emulates login as root (sudo -i emulates the login even more accurately).\nsource /etc/environment won't work, because source is a shell command that tells the shell to interpret the given file as a shell script. The problem is: /etc/environment is not a shell script. It is a list of environment variable name-value pair in the format:\nname=\"value\"\n\nThat line, for a shell, is the definition of a global variable, which can be seen only by shell itself. Programs executed from the shell can't see it. The correct way to define an environment variable is using the export shell command:\nexport name=\"value\"\n\nSo, if you really want to use your brand new LD_LIBRARY_PATH without logging out, you should execute the following command instead of source /etc/environment:\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\"/opt/...\"\n\n\nUPDATE: LD_LIBRARY_PATH cannot be set into /etc/environment because of ssh-agent. For details see bug #47958 and the Ubuntu wiki page on environment variables. As specified in the wiki page, a workaround exists and consists in using /etc/ld.so.conf.d.\nFor example, you could create /etc/ld.so.conf.d/opt.conf with the following contents:\n# Paths for my cool libraries\n/opt/...\n\nAlthough this is listed as a workaround, ld.so.conf.d is actually the most appropriate place for such settings.\n", "Q: Uninstall Ubuntu 12.04 I want to uninstall my Ubuntu 12.04 (installed using Wubi).

If not, try searching the required version on packages.ubuntu.com or other sites. For example, you can try this package: 2.97-1ubuntu6.1.\nThen, open file /etc/apt/preferences as root (create the file if it doesn't exist yet) and add the following lines:\nPackage: rhythmbox\nPin: version 2.97-1ubuntu6.1\nPin-Priority: 1001\n\n(Replace 2.97-1ubuntu6.1 with the exact version you've installed.)\nThis will force apt-get, aptitude and all such utilities to keep Rhythmbox at this version even when repository has a newer one. If you need to install older versions of some other packages (e.g. rhythmbox-data or maybe some libraries), add similar three lines to the same file, with one line between «paragraphs». You can find some more information about /etc/apt/preferences syntax here.\n\nUPDATE:\nI would suggest you to install rhythmbox with all required packages at once with a single console command. I've just tried to do it now, so this is what you need:\n\n\n*\n\n*Remove your currently installed Rhythmbox (if this is not possible due to other dependencies, you may try to skip this step and ignore some warnings later).\n\n*Download packages from quantal: rhythmbox_2.97-1ubuntu5, libmusicbrainz5-0, librhythmbox-core6, rhythmbox-data, gir1.2-rb-3.0. Put them all in a single directory.\n\n*Open terminal, cd to the directory and run sudo dpkg -i *.deb. This should install the old Rhythmbox.\n\n\nAfter that, just look which updates do you have in Synaptic or elsewhere, and add those packages to /etc/apt/preferences as I've wrote above.\n\nA: To downgrade from 2.98:\nsudo apt-get purge rhythmbox gir1.2-rb-3.0 librhythmbox-core5 rhythmbox-mozilla rhythmbox-data rhythmbox-plugin-zeitgeist rhythmbox-plugin-magnatune rhythmbox-plugin-cdrecorder librhythmbox-core6 rhythmbox-plugins\n\ni.e. the ppa-purge does not clean-up fully and leaves some libraries still at their v2.98 versions.\nFinish off by updating your sources:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nAnd install an old version of rhytmbox:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:fossfreedom/rhythmbox\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install rhythmbox\n\nThis will leave you with the default and stable Rhythmbox 2.97.\n\nA: Have a look at this thread for downgrading: http://www.howtogeek.com/117929/how-to-downgrade-packages-on-ubuntu/\n", "Q: Xubuntu splash hangs on boot for 15s Problem started recently.

This indicates a problem with your application.\nHere the problem is that fetchone() returns a one-tuple. You should change from this line:\nvalue = results.fetchone()\n\nto this (notice the comma after value):\nvalue, = results.fetchone()\n\nor this (not recommended):\nvalue = results.fetchone()[0]\n\n\nBut why is fetchone() returning a tuple instead of a string? Because you can SELECT multiple columns. Consider for example the following SQL statement:\nSELECT a, b, c FROM my_table;\n\nIn this case, fetchone() will return a three-tuple.\nWriting value, = fetchone() you are telling Python that you are expecting a one-tuple and you want that single item placed into value. If you were expecting the three-tuple, you'd have used column_a, column_b, column_c = resulsts.fetchone().\nThis is the reason why you should prefer value, over fetchone()[0].\n\nBonus tip: I noticed you are using Python 3. In this case, you can write:\ntranslation_table = dict.fromkeys(b'+-(),', None)\n\nSpeeding up your code and making it more clean.\n", "Q: Nautilus search provider Gnome-Shell Activities / Overview I do not get search results for files in the Gnome Shell overview except for files that are placed in my Home folder.

I bought a new WD Hard Drive. 250Gb, WD2500BPT.\nI installed Ubuntu (13.04 was it?) on it.

(The extended partition, if you've got one, is an exception to this rule; don't worry about it's alignment, since it's irrelevant.) For instance:\n$ sudo fdisk -lu /dev/sda\n\nDisk /dev/sda: 160.0 GB, 160041885696 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 19457 cylinders, total 312581808 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x8e0cb6b5\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1              63    20033054    10016496   27  Unknown\n/dev/sda2        20033055   103699574    41833260    7  HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sda3   *   103699575   249907139    73103782+   5  Extended\n/dev/sda5       103699638   131781194    14040778+   7  HPFS/NTFS\n/dev/sda6       131781258   183992444    26105593+   b  W95 FAT32\n/dev/sda7       183992508   187076924     1542208+  82  Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/sda8   *   187076988   187398224      160618+  83  Linux\n/dev/sda9       187398288   249907139    31254426   8e  Linux LVM\n\nThis example is from a non-Advanced Format disk, and it is not properly aligned -- /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2 both begin on sectors with odd numbers, and so can't be divisible by 8. (/dev/sda3 also begins on an odd-numbered sector, but as it's an extended partition, this fact is irrelevant for this partition.) I haven't bothered to check the others, but a few seconds with a calculator would reveal their status. Since this disk isn't an Advanced Format model, this isn't a problem; but if it were such a disk, performance could be significantly degraded.\nIf you find that your disk is improperly aligned, you may be able to move/resize the offending partition(s), or it may be easier to start over again, since it sounds like you've just installed Ubuntu. Generally speaking, recent versions of Ubuntu (and other Linux distributions) set things up correctly by default, so if your partitions aren't properly aligned, you may want to consider why that's the case. For instance, if you set up your partitions with an old version of fdisk, it wouldn't use the new alignment rules and so might produce something like I've shown above. If that's the case, use a newer tool or learn to set up the partitions with proper alignment using the old tool.\n", "Q: My Ubuntu 12.04.2 Online Accounts only has Google and Windows Live accounts.

The 300 series drivers are the current stable drivers and are the recommended choice for the GeForce 8000 and higher cards. These drivers normally provide the best performance, optimization and support.\n", "Q: How to install ubuntu on lenovo g580? I'd like to install Ubuntu 13.04 on Lenovo g580 and I have this issue.\nAfter a few seconds of booting liveUSB screens gets black and nothing happens.\nI've read somewhere about connecting second screen to solve similar issue.\nOf course this didn't solve it, but it provided something like terminal with\n\ninitramfs>\n\nand few basic commands ..\nIs it possible to install Ubuntu on Lenovo g580 hardware?\nI also checked\nUbuntu 12.04: failed\nMint 13: SUCCEED (x32 and x64)\nIs it because of drivers?\nOf course I want Ubuntu instead of Mint. :)\n\nA: Try hitting Fn+↑ several times.

So the next move was to shutdown the Windows8 properly.\nI did it with these steps:\nDisable \"Fast startup\" like here:\nhttp://mywindows8.org/fast-start-up-in-windows-8/\nAnd optionally If You turn off the computer with 'power button', make sure that 'power button' is set to shutdown in 'power management' in Windows configuration I mean this window.\nFor me it works perfectly.\n", "Q: How to disable Ubuntu 13.04 Unity fancy visual effects? Unity works very fast but pretty unstable on my PC (with Intel GMA X4500HD video card). For example the Ubuntu purple-black splash screen is stuck as the desktop background (changing it in the settings changes nothing) and occasional UI hangs (while switching to a console with Ctrl+Alt+# still works) are frequent.\nI would gladly sacrifice fancy GPU-accelerated effects if possible. Are there such tweaks available?\nPlease don't suggest using another DE - I know of them but would like Unity if possible.\n\nA: You can use the Compiz Config Settings Manager to change the behavior and effects of Ubuntu. If you are really adventurous you could look into this to tweak some things. Just be aware that it is a pretty advanced tool. Changing the wrong options can leave you with an unusable desktop. Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of experience with this tool so I can't give advice on which settings you could change..\n", "Q: How to find the PPA of the Skype package? For example, with a webpage like this: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/skype, how can I find out to which ppa this package belongs? Thanks!\n\nA: Skype isn't part of a ppa, it's part of an official repo. Usually to view info about a package you'll be in the sub page of a ppa, however for this you aren't as skype is just part of the partner repo, and isn't in a ppa.\n\nA: Normally all packages that are included in launchpad.net/ubuntu/ are actually inside the default repository! So no need to add a PPA for Skype, just make sure that the partner repository is enabled and you can just search for it in the Ubuntu Software Center.\nJust a quick tip: When looking for software it is probably best to only use a PPA if there really isn't another way. Also make sure you only add PPA's that you absolutely trust or are maintained by the developer of the software. A bad PPA can cause all kinds of nasty, hard to troubleshoot issues.\n", "Q: How do I setup multiple minicom / Cisco console server sessions without too much hassle? I'm working on my CCNA and have 4 switches & 4 routers which make up my main lab.\nI bought two quad port USB to Serial (1 USB to 4 Serial) Adapters onto the ends of which I've attached 8 Serial rollover cables.\nThose USBs are plugged into a P4 Ubuntu server and I can successfully ssh into that server and manage any of the devices using minicom, as myself as I'm in the dialout group.\nI have a minicom save file for USB[0-7] and have used ln to link SW1-4, R1-4 so I can \"minicom R1\", etc.\nWith my dual monitors, I can have all 8 terminal sessions open - 4 on each screen.\nHere's the main thing though: I have to open a terminal on my workstation, SSH across to the access server, then run minicom. I have to do this once for each device. Although that's not a back breaker, I'm sure there must be a simpler way to do it - can I tell my server to expose each serial connection as a telnet or ssh port? I would really like to be able to run a script of some sort that launched all eight sessions in one click.\n\nA: Some time ago I was able to make this kind of serial to network redirection using remserial:\n\nGive access to a RS232 device over a network.\nThe computer with the serial port connected to the device (such as a\n  data aquisition device) runs the remserial program:\nremserial -d -p 23000 -s \"9600 raw\" /dev/ttyS0 &\n\nThis starts the program in daemon mode so that it runs in the\n  background, it waits for connections on port 23000 and sets up the\n  serial port /dev/ttyS0 at 9600 baud. Network connections to port 23000\n  from any machine can then read and write to the device attached to the\n  serial port.\nThis can be started from /etc/rc.local or as an entry in /etc/inittab\n  or set up as a system service with a file in /etc/rc.init/.\n\nThis is what you need:\n\nServer farm console control.\nAssuming multiple Linux servers (such as web servers) are set up to\n  have a serial port as their console instead of a monitor/keyboard,\n  their serial ports could be connected to a control server using a\n  multi-port serial board. On the control server, a copy of remserial is\n  run for each server:\nremserial -d -p 23000 -s \"115200 raw\" /dev/ttyS0\nremserial -d -p 23001 -s \"115200 raw\" /dev/ttyS1\nremserial -d -p 23002 -s \"115200 raw\" /dev/ttyS2\nremserial -d -p 23003 -s \"115200 raw\" /dev/ttyS3\n\nFrom any computer on the local network, use a telnet program to\n  connect to the control server on the appropriate port:\ntelnet control-server-name 23002\n\nThis would connect through the associated serial port to the desired\n  server's console. This example would then give the user console access\n  to the 3rd server.\nCareful scripting such as using the Linux \"expect\" program could allow\n  batches of commands to be run on each server.\n\nAt the end of the page you'll find links to download a precompiled binary for i386 (32-bit) and the source code (if you're running a 64-bit OS or prefer to compile it yourself).\nEDIT: To add a little automation you can install expect and write the following script:\n#!/usr/bin/expect\n\nspawn telnet 192.168.0.1\nexpect \"Username:\"\nsend \"your-username\\r\"\nexpect \"Password:\"\nsend \"your-password\\r\"\nexpect \"#\"            <----- prompt character ($ or #)\ninteract\n\nThis will automatically telnet to the host login and drop you to the prompt.\n", "Q: Partial upgrade - why remove MariaDB?

Can you disable only part of a touchpad? I'm using a Lenovo Yoga13, and the touchpad extends down into the click area. So, every time I click, it moves the mouse a little bit. It's pretty annoying. \nIs there a calibration tool or something? I just need to disable the bottom inch of my touchpad. \n\nA: From the synaptics driver man page:\n\nThe  perceived  physical  edges  may be adjusted with the AreaLeftEdge, AreaRightEdge,\n  AreaTopEdge, and AreaBottomEdge options. If these values are set to something other than \n  the physical edges, input in the space between the area edge and the respective physical \n  edge is ignored. Note that this reduces the available space on the touchpad.\n\nAnd that's exactly what we want, right? Therefore, we are going to have to come up with a value for AreaBottomEdge, get the other three using xinput, and write a custom xorg.conf.\nFirst of all, we need to find some information about our touchpad. In a terminal, run xinput list. For me, the output looks like this:\n$ xinput list\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer            id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ PIXART USB OPTICAL MOUSE              id=11   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad              id=14   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎣ Virtual core keyboard                     id=3    [master keyboard (2)]\n    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard           id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                          id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Video Bus                             id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Video Bus                             id=8    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Power Button                          id=9    [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Sleep Button                          id=10   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ Chicony USB 2.0 Camera                id=12   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n    ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard          id=13   [slave  keyboard (3)]\n\nMy touchpad is identified as ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad. Now we need to find out some information for creating the xorg.conf later. Let's figure out what values the driver is currently using for the touchpad edges by running: \nxinput list-props \"ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad\"|grep Edges\n\nwhich, for me, outputs:\nSynaptics Edges (280):  97, 2339, 56, 988\n\nSave these values for later.\nNow, create a new file named /etc/X11/xorg.conf if it doesn't already exist, open it using your favorite text editor as root, and put this in it, using the values we found earlier:\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n    Identifier \"touchpad\"\n    Driver \"synaptics\"\n    Option \"AreaLeftEdge\" \"97\"             # the first value from \"Synaptics Edges\"\n    Option \"AreaRightEdge\" \"2339\"          # the second value\n    Option \"AreaTopEdge\" \"56\"              # the third value\n    Option \"AreaBottomEdge\" \"988\"          # the fourth value - change this\nEndSection\n\nRemember that, for best results when creating this file, you must use the values that you found yourself. Do not use mine. (I'm not calling you an idiot or anything; I'm just making sure so that you don't screw this up.)\nAlso, you are going to have to change the value for AreaBottomEdge so that it is less than the original and meets your requirements. You are going to have to experiment with this until you are satisfied with the results.\nAlso remember to log out and log back in after saving the file for the changes to take effect.\n\nA: If your laptop using Syntaptics touchpad you can do this with synclient command.\nFor example, to shrink touch area on the right:\n$ synclient -l | grep RightEdge                             \n    RightEdge               = 1168\n    AreaRightEdge           = 0\n\n$ synclient AreaRightEdge=900\n\nThe RightEdge shows physical eight edge coordinate. You could not change that, but you can override it using AreaRightEdge.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 CD-R doesn't start when i start the PC I've got an Ubuntu CD-R and a Samsung Laptop with Windows 8 64 Bit.\nWhen i start the Laptop with the Ubuntu CD-R in it, it shows the Samsung-sign, makes a \"Beep\" tune, shows the normal \"Loading-Circle\" and then Windows 8 starts normaly... \nI know something about changing the boot device in the Bios, but my laptop doesn't show the normal message \"Press F12 to Bios setup\", its just the Samsung-sign and then Windows 8 boots, so i dont know how to enter the bios...\nTank you for your help and sorry for my bad English :)\n\nA: Without a specific model, it's hard to tell you exactly how to do this, but:\nSafeBoot is likely to be blocking CD boot, so you are indeed headed in the right direction.\nNote that not all BIOSes want F12 - some like DEL, some F2 and so on.\nAlso, ensure you are in fact pressing the F key - on my HP Pavilion G6, to get F2 I have to hold [fn] + [BRIGHTNESS DOWN], to get F3 I have to hold [fn] + [BRIGHTNESS UP] and so on.\n", "Q: Problem with starting Steam on Ubuntu 64-bit I've recently installed Ubuntu, and tried installing steam.

There's obviously a way to check to see when an update is a security update. I often get greeted by a motd that says \"there are N security updates.\"\nWhat I'd like to do is have my server email me a list of what packages need updating for security reasons. \nTo take it a step further, the email would link to the applicable security notification from Ubuntu.\nBasically, each server is somewhat unique. I've received several emails on the security mailing list for packages I do not have install on any/all servers. So I'd like each individual server to tell me what it needs. That way I can apply updates in a timely manner, while avoiding restarting services like Apache that would cause users to have some downtime.\nHow could I do this?\n\nA: You can use tool called apticron to notify you when new updates are available. It sends you e-mail about pending upgrades, also giving you a choice to only send you e-mail about updates not previously notified. \nTo setup apticron edit /etc/apticron/apticron.conf and change line containing e-mail address: \nEMAIL=\"admin@example.com\"\n\nEnter the e-mail address you wish to receive notifications to.\nFor more information see man apticron.\n\nA: From a previous post. you can run security upgrades via command line with. \nsudo unattended-upgrade\n\nI checked it out and you can also use the command line option \n sudo unattended-upgrade --dry-run\n\nTo download but not install updates. \nWhen running the program I am not getting any output, I think this is because I have my system set to auto-update. If you can get output from this just figure out what the  updated vs. pending updates look like and write a shell script to send you an email containing of the output of the pending updates. \nThen run this script as a cron job. \nNote: use crontab -e to run jobs as root. \n", "Q: Bad HDD in LVM recovery time at boot My server/desktop started reporting read errors on a HDD in my 16 drive lvm.  The drive is a 2TB WD EARS model.  \nWhile I have a backup from April, I'd rather not loose the last month of changes, or the time it will take to rebuild from the backup.\nAs before, I used the gui to remove the bad drive.   pvmove crashed during the process.   Shortly after that the server crashed.   On bootup it began a repair process.   That was saturday morning, about 3 1/2 days ago.   \nThe server is still showing the bootup messages regarding read errors with a sector number.

Eventually I got the computer to boot with all but the bad drive attached, Skipping the disk check and Cancelling the wait for the bad lv mount.   \nNow one 8T ext4 fs out of the 24T vg is back but the 14T ext4 lv appears beyond repair.  the lvm gui tool crashes when launched, something to do with the pvmove0 segment I cant seem to get rid of.\n", "Q: Can I keep applications open after last window is closed? Is it possible to have a Mac OS behavior in Ubuntu 13.04 and let an app stay active / open after last window is closed?\n\nA: If you use the \"nohup\" (no hangup) command when starting the command, you may get the behavior you want.  see the man page, \n man nohup\n\nPutting an \"&\" after the command will run it in the background, but closing the terminal is likely to end that command, since the closing window generates the \"hangup\" signal, which may be the problem you have been having.\n", "Q: Run .sh every time a file changes I'm working with a system that uses a Ubuntu server as base but we do program at Windows.

Last think I did it was a the installation of a python interpreter. Is it likely to have some source list deleted. I dont know whether I can restore my system. \nI dont know how to access my internet connection from the termial. So I cannot update or upgrade anything.  \nAnother thing is that whatever I write on my terminal it doesn't appear but it remains invisible. So I should be careful what I type in otherwise I will make thing worse. In same cases I cant even see any feedback from my terminal This is even more confusing.\nIs there any way out how to restore it a day before unless there is any other way more efficient\nThank you in advance\nVangjush Komini \n\nA: You've not been clear on what has gone. But you should remember that if you boot from a live cd, you will be able to mount the hard drive and save your data to another place such as a USB disk. Depending on what kind of data is saved ono the machine, it may prove simpler for you to back up your data using the livecd, reinstall, then copy your data back.\nYour description sounds more like a crashed X server than the command line - [CTRL][ALT][F1] will take you to the first terminal / command line, and you can debug from there.\nIf you remember what it was you changed software wise, you may try typing\nsudo apt-get remove [packageyouadded]\n\nfor a package you installed and think broke something, or\nsudo apt-get install [packageyoudeleted]\n\nto reinstall something that is missing.\nEDIT: As Andrejs points out, you can also ask your system to have a go at fixing any dependencies that are broken:\nsudo apt-get install -f\n\nwithout any package name. This will check for missing / broken programs that are stopping an installed program from running.\n", "Q: how to use an image for my custom .desktop file for unity previews When one left clicks an application, it also displays the screenshot of the desired application. \nscreenshot of the desired effect:\n \nI can't find the screenshotlink=? command in the vlc.desktop file (and or other .desktop files)\nThis is what I have now:\nQuestion: How to get an image for my custom made .desktop file. \nNote: If needed, I can post the code used for my custom  .desktop file\n\nA: It seems that the name of the .desktop files itself relate to applications in software center.\nIf you copy the /usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop to your ~/.local/share/applications and then rename firefox.desktop to (for example) libreoffice-calc.desktop (content of the file untouched). Then type in firefox and you'll see in one of the items the preview and comments from libre instead of firefox.\nTherefore i think that it is not possible to have own preview images / thumbnails unless your application is in the ubuntu repos.\n", "Q: Running a classic ASP website on Ubuntu 12.04 I will start the conversion of an old web site programmed on Classic ASP to PHP. I'd like to run and test the ASP scripts locally.\nSo, how can I run these ASP scripts in my Linux Ubuntu 12.04 (w/ LXDE) system?\nI know I can use a VM in Virtual Box and install the stuff there. If this is the only solution, maybe I'll do that.\nPerhaps someone will suggest something on Wine. I don't know.\nBut I would prefer if there is something that can run natively, as PHP itself runs... ideally I would configure my NginX HTTP server similarly as I do for the PHP files...\nI wonder if such an installable Linux version of classic ASP exists... does it?\nThank you.\n\nA: I know back in the day (and we're talking about fourteen years ago, when I was using ASP) there were alternative implementations of ASP. The most famous and the only one I've ever seen running on not-Windows was ChiliSoft ASP.\nBut ChiliSoft were gobbled up by Sun. Sun killed off ChiliSoft's product but imbibed its soul and capabilities into Sun Server One. More time occurred and Sun were eaten by Oracle... Somewhere in that time the product died. Even if it does somehow exist still, I would bet a large pot of money on it not being maintained, let alone compatible with Linux 2.6+.\nASP is ancient.\nI shouldn't need to point that out but I need to highlight that nobody has considered it worthy of promoting in over a decade, let alone waste a ton of time reimplementing such a horribly limited language and framework.\nThere may be the possibility of getting an alternative implementation running under Wine. Or even a native one - but if your legacy code uses anything like an ODBC database (kids these days won't have a clue what I'm talking about), you're going to be stuffed.\nThe easiest way to deal with this is to just mirror your stack from 10 years ago. Bung a copy of Win2k on Virtualbox, and just host it the way it was designed for. Do your porting and then move all the files onto a flash drive (or Iomega Zip Disk if you hate anachronisms), tape that to a heavy rock and then and drop that baby in the ocean.\n\nNote: Packages like Apache::ASP are red herrings. There are plenty of modules that give ASP-like interpretation. Apache::ASP gives a Perlscript-like spin on the whole thing but it won't let you run VBScript.\nNote 2: ModVB exists but seemingly hasn't been touched since its inception in 2003. And that is based on mod_gb from 2002 which has had similarly low activity in the past decade. I'm not sure either of these would work with a modern Apache and you've still got ancillary issues (eg databases) still.\nNote 3: You could also reimplement ASP yourself with a home-made parser written in whatever language you like. Most languages that have been around a while have language parsers. It'd probably be slower and buggier but it might be enough to actually run something. But seriously, if you're even considering this, you're very silly. Please just reimplement your site in a current language.\n", "Q: Desktop environments not working properly after nvidia graphic driver installation So I tried to install the graphics drivers for my nvidia geforce gt540m on ubuntu 13.04 64 bit. I tried following the instructions here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1916961\nbut it didn't work right and now the only desktop environment I can boot into is gnome fallback. (I have unity and cinnamon installed as well.) in unity metacity doesn't work anymore and in cinnamon it crashes and goes to fallback. I just want to get my system back to the way that it was and I was going to follow the following instructions to install the nvidia drivers : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee#Installation\nPlease advise how to fix my current problem and also if I should follow the instructions provided in the link or a different set of instructions.\nthanks in advance.\n\nA: If your machine is an Optimus technology one, using the bumblebee ppa is by far the easiest and most hassle free experience.\nTo undo the damage done, try: \nsudo apt-get purge -remove nvidia*  \n\nto remove all nvidia related drivers.\nIf you installed via the .run file, re-run the .run file using teh same method as installation, this time it will ask if you want to uninstall. Do so completely.\nOnce done, make sure the machine is now clean of previous nvidia and other related installs.\nOnce done, use the install method provided in \nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee#Installation\nThat should work...\n\nA: Try using:  \nsudo apt-get --purge autoremove nvidia-current  \n\nWorked for me.\n", "Q: New Password, please help! I haven't used my linux computer in a couple of months because I went abroad, so I downgraded to be safe in case it got stolen; But the thing is I cannot log in because the password I believe to have used does not work any more.  Is there a way I can change this or do I have to take it into a store? Thanks!\n\nA: Hold shift when you bootup your computer.  The GRUB menu will come up.  Select \"Advanced Options\" and then \"Recovery Mode.\"  Once you are in recovery mode, type: \nmount -o remount,rw /\nto get your filesystem mounted read/write.  Then type:\npasswd {your username}\nThen enter your new password.  Reboot and you should be good to go.  Let me know if you have any problems and we'll take it step by step.\n", "Q: Disable discovery or listing of HDD partitions I would like to disable auto detection or listing of certain partitions in applications such as Nautilus. I have a HP laptop that contains a recovery partition along with a EFI partition and I would like to hide/disable them so they are not visible to any Ubuntu user to prevent accidentally changing these. Can this be done?\n\nA: You can alter the user privileges and revoke the right to mount filesystems. Take a look at \"System settings -> user management -> edit user\" or something similar on your system.\nA more radical approach is to use GParted and enable the \"hidden\" flag for the partitions you wish to hide. BE WARNED that this will also hide them from the boot process - the partitions will be completely hidden from your system. Also, if the boot-loader is installed on one of these partitions you will have to move it to be able to boot. In other words, use this method only if you don't care about dual-booting.\n", "Q: how do I activate the dash to display feeds from my online accounts in the social media lense?

I am using 13.04 on an old laptop hooked up to a printer that I would like to access from my Windows 8 PC.

Then when I open the server, for it to show me all the printers connected to that computer. And finally, to be able to install and print right from there.\nI have searched hours and tried multiple solutions but none seem to work. As soon as I get a reasonable answer, I will wipe my current configuration and start from scratch, so that none of my work will interfere with the solution.\nPlease when you answer make sure to start from the beginning. As I will not have a single thing set up.

What I would like to do is set the system language to english and all text editions to spanish, is that possible?\nMaybe re-install Ubuntu in english over?\nAlso, I installed GNome Do and each time I try to set the activation keys, it wont remember them.\nThank you.\n\nA: Go to Language support, and make sure that both the Language tab, and Regional Format tab are both set to English.  I would also recommend that you go into the Keyboard layout, just to make sure English is there.\n\n\n\n\nA: Try selecting English, Applying System-Wide, then remove Spanish from the computer. If that does not work, I would advise reinstalling... as Ubuntu might have installed all Spanish versions of the system applications.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Program fails with strange errors in Wine I just installed Silhouette Studio in Wine.

anyone know how to fix this?  Are there extra Wine packages that can be installed?\n\nA: Ok, so I was able to get it to work through the following method.  I still don't know how to \"fix\" the problems, but this seems to help avoid them.\n1) If a version of the program is installed in Wine, remove it using the \"Wine uninstall programs.\"\n2) Add the Ubuntu Wine Team PPA to your sources:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa\n3) Upgrade to the latest Wine (currently 1.5) with dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n4) Verify that any old version of the program is uninstalled in Wine using the \"Wine uninstall programs.\"\n5) Reinstall the program using the \"Wine uninstall programs.\"  There is an option to \"Add\" a program.  Use this to select the .exe and install.\n6) Repeat steps 4 and 5 until it works.  For me it worked the second time.\n", "Q: Cannot SSHFS mount user home directory I am attempting to setup a centralized home-directory server through sshfs and pam-mount.\nCurrently I am stuck at this point:\nWhen attempting to mount the remote home directory sshfs just gets stuck:\nd_inevitable@laptop:~$ sshfs -o nonempty,debug server: .\nFUSE library version: 2.9.0\nnullpath_ok: 0\nnopath: 0\nutime_omit_ok: 0\n\nIt freezes at this point.\nThis seems to be because the home directory includes ~/.ssh. So when I try sshfs -o nonempty server:.ssh .ssh the same thing happens.\nI suppose fuse somehow initializes the mount, but then ssh needs something from it's config directory so it tries to read from it. Fuse will just block that read resulting in a deadlock.\nWhat kind of stuff does sshfs need from ~/.ssh?\nI have tried to remove all read/write permissions from ~/.ssh and then mounting on some other directory. That worked fine. The debug output only complained about writing to .ssh/known_hosts.\n\nA: You are right, fuse initiates the mount first, then initiates the ssh process. This causes a problem for you, since by default ssh reads ~/.ssh/ssh_config, ~/.ssh/known_hosts\n\n, ~/.ssh/id_* files from user home. This behavior can be changed:\n\n*\n\n*~/.ssh/ssh_config is the default per-user configuration file. An alternative per-user configuration file can be specified using -F option, or use -F /dev/null to specify no per-user configuration file.\n\n*~/.ssh/known_hosts is used to store and check host keys. You can use -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null, and either manually add the host key to /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts or use -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no.\n\n*~/.ssh/id_* files are identity files by default used for client authentication. If you want to authenticate using an identity file, you need to keep it outside the home directory and use -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -o IdentityFile=<path to private key>. Or else you can authenticate interactively if you use -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -o IdentityFile=/dev/null -o PubkeyAuthentication=no.\n\nFor example to mount home using sshfs, authenticating using password, without host key checking, run\nsshfs user@server: ~/ -o nonempty -F /dev/null -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -o IdentityFile=/dev/null -o PubkeyAuthentication=no\n\n", "Q: How to downgrade packages on Ubuntu? Update Manager keeps packages at the latest version, but occasionally a new package version may not work as expected or properly. How to downgrade an installed package and lock it at a specific version to prevent it from being updated? How can I do this using GUI or using a Terminal?\n\nA: Another possibility:\nLets find the archived package on http://packages.ubuntu.com/:\nFor example downgrading php5 :\nSearch:\n\nFound an exact hit lets look at the package page for php5 :\n\nWe can see the different versions of Ubuntu releases here we are at trusty:\n\nLets switch to version that ran php (5.3) ... 12.04 (precise) for example:\n\ndownload the tar.gz\n\nAnd then extract the tar file and install it:\ncd /path/to/download\ntar -xzvf name_of_package\ncd name_of_extracted_folder\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nPossible issues that one could run into when running ./configure:\n\n*\n\n*Missing dependencies ( had to install libxm2-dev):\n\nIssues running make:\n\n*\n\n*errors while compiling could include flags not being set properly, or issues with the code itself.\n\n*A bunch of garbage when compiling, and then some issue in the code?\n\n*In my case i had to find the up to date source files/tarball for php ( http://php.net/downloads.php )\n\n*and retry extraction and make\n\n\nA: In GUI - using Synaptic\nThe Ubuntu Software Center’s simplified interface doesn’t offer the option to downgrade packages. Synaptic, a more advanced graphical package manager interface that Ubuntu used to include, offers this option. To downgrade a package graphically, first install the Synaptic application:\n\nAfter you done this, open the Synaptic Package Manager from the Dash:\n\nSearch for the package you want to install an older version of in Synaptic, select it, and use the Package > Force Version option:\n\nSelect the version you want to install and click Force Version. Synaptic will only show you versions available in your repositories:\n\nClick the Apply button to apply your changes and install the older version of the package, assuming everything works properly.\n\nAfter you downgrade the package, select it and use the Package > Lock Version option. If you don’t do this, Ubuntu will try to upgrade the installed package the next time you update your installed packages:\n\nIn Terminal – using apt-get\nYou can install a specific version of a package with apt-get in the Terminal. First, determine the available versions you can install with the following command (use for packagename the name of the program that you want to downgrade):\napt-cache showpkg [packagename]\n\nNext, run the apt-get install command and specify the package version you want to install (use for version the version number previously determined of the program that you want to downgrade):\nsudo apt-get install [packagename]=[version]\n\nAfter it’s installed, run the following command to hold your installed version, preventing the package manager from automatically updating it in the future:\nsudo echo \"[packagename] hold\" | sudo dpkg --set-selections\n\nSource: http://www.howtogeek.com/117929/how-to-downgrade-packages-on-ubuntu/\n", "Q: LCD monitor 2033 out of rang in ubuntu 13.04 i have a problem in ubuntu 13.04 when i want install or login .\ni installed ubuntu with a crt monitor but when to login with lcd monitor , i dont have screen ( out of rang )\nmy monitor is samsung lcd syncmaster 2033\n\nA: Try passing the nomodeset option to the kernel when booting.

I've multiple screens i.e. one computer monitor and one TV. It would be preferable if, when the TV is turned off, nothing is sent to the TV but as it happens, I can have the TV turned off and doubleclick a PDF document and then it seems to appear nowhere since it is sent to the television which is turned off. This behavior is somewhat illogical (though I'm happy that multiple screens work so that I can play a movie on the TV and have a desktop with another monitor with my work) so could you tell me how I can do to resolve it? I'm using a Dell Optiplex 745 with a graphics card with double DVI out, I don't use HDMI but a DVI to HDMI cable and I believe that the cable is good.\n\n\nA: Seems like the TV as a display is being detected even after being switched off. Just pulling out the dvi cable, if it is easily accessible from your seat, should work ;)\n\nIf it isn't, then use the following command to turn of the TV as a monitor.\nxrandr --output XXX --mode HRESxVRES --output YYY --off\nHere XXX is the name of your primary display. YYY is the name of your TV. HRESxVRES is the resolution you want to set your primary monitor to.\n\nTo figure out what XXX and YYY are, inspect the output of the command xrandr --current when both monitors are on and being used.\nXXX will most probably either be LVDS1 or VGA1 and YYY is most probably DVI1.\nIn addition, the output will also contain the allowed values for HRESxVRES.\n\nYou may choose to add an alias for the command or add a launcher button that executes the command.\n\nA: I have run into this problem as well with my dual monitor setup.

This is why I use Put within viewport.\nSide tip:\nUnder System Settings > Displays, make sure your TV is the one on the right (even if it's not physically on the right) to make it more likely that programs will default to the monitor.\n", "Q: How to install windows 8, on a computer completely running ubuntu? I tried booting from the dvd to install windows 8, but unfortunately I can only install windows 8 on an ntfs hdd. So i got GParted, but I can't create a new partition. I was thinking I could hook up the hdd to another computer I have. It has a e-sata plug-in so I'm not sure if it will work. Even then, would I be able to format it and install windows 8 on it?\nAll these are just ideas i've had that either didn't work, or i'm afraid to test out. What can I do to install windows 8 on a computer that isn't ntfs formatted.\n\nA: Use GParted Live.\nThe reason you're not able to use GParted to resize your partition is because it's mounted as /, you can't edit a mounted partition, and you can't umount it either as it is /. That's why they made GParted Live.\nBurn it to a CD or DVD using something like k3b or any other program and boot from it, choose live mode and it will prompt for a few entries while booting, just press enter at each one. If live mode hangs or anything, just choose \"other modes\" and then \"safe mode\".\nYou'll be met with GParted GUI on boot, where you can Resize your partition to clear up free space, there will be a warning but it's very safe, you might want to leave about 150GB on your Ubuntu partition just to be safe, also understand that GParted standards dictate 1MB = 1024 KB and not 1000 and it's the same for all other multiple units. After resizing there will be free unused space, which you can use for your installation, either format it using GParted or while you're installing Windows.\nYou might also want to leave some free space between partitions, just until you're sure you're satisfied with your space and partition table and then join it to any other partition. DO NOT leave free space lurking in between partitions on your drive, it could create read/write issues and shorten the drive life span, it's not really lethal but still not something you want to do.\n", "Q: Errno 5 Input/output error in ubuntu 13.04 I'm trying to install Ubuntu 13.04 in VMWare but while on the middle of copying files, a pop-up error would appear: \nThe installer encountered an error copying files to the hard disk:\n[Errno 5] Input/output error\n\nThis is often due to a faulty CD/DVD disk or drive, or a faulty hard disk.

But after I restart the directories are gone again.\nHow do I make them exist permanently?\n\nA: Ok so nothing you do on a tmpfs is not going to persist after a restart. That's because a tmpfs is temporary and only exists in the RAM. Anything that needs to be on a tmpfs for the system to run must be created every time the system boots. Most processes that use /var do this but some it seems such as anacron and cups-pdf do not.\nTo fix this you have to create a script that creates these directories every time the system starts.

I went into my file /etc/apt/apt.conf and it was like this:\nAcquire {\nRetries \"0\";\nHTTP {\nProxy \"http://proxy:8080\";\n};\n};\n\nSo what I did was to comment the lines regarding the proxy\nAcquire {\n#Retries \"0\";\n#    HTTP {\n#        Proxy \"http://proxy:8080\";\n#    };\n};\n\nAnd that solved my proxy-connection problem.\nNow I'm dealing with some errors related to java as an installer. (Extracted java from the .tar.gz file I'd downloaded from Oracle, put it into my /usr/lib/jvm folder, but it won't actually let me use it, saying that \n    lucaciandrei@ubuntu:~$ java -version\n    bash: /usr/bin/java: No such file or directory\n)\nBut that's another question, for another topic. \nThanks for your responses, Oli response will be mark as accepted, since it provided the work-around to my problem.\n\nA: Sounds like apt's proxy configuration is seriously incorrect. I would guess you've either made a typo in the name of the proxy or you're trying to point to a local hostname that your system cannot look up.\nEither way, two suggested fixes:\n\n\n*\n\n*Just fix your configuration. See: how to install packages with apt-get on a system connected via proxy?\n\n*Add the hostname and IP you're trying to resolve to /etc/hosts\nEdit: On second look, it seems your configuration is looking for a proxy at proxy so that's what you want to add to your hosts file (assuming there even is a proxy). You can run ping proxy to confirm that it's not getting looked up correctly.\n", "Q: Change the default screenshot destination folder of \"Prnt Scrn\" key?

I have tried deleting the file, I have tried creating an empty file from a text console - I still get the error.\nEither I have to find a way of getting past this error, or find a way to change my $HOME after login (from my .profile?).\nCan anyone help me?\n\nA: My advice won't solve all your problems, but you may find it enough. You could have only a bunch of directories in the NFS server. i.e., the Documents directory. To do so, mount your nfs server home somewhere like /media/nfs_server/home. Then change the contents of the file ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs\nThere you can change the Documents default dir and set it to your NFS server home:\nYou should have something like:\nXDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR=\"$HOME/Documents\"\n\nChange it to:\nXDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR=\"/media/nfs_server/home/my_login/Documents\"\n\nReplace it to where you really mount your NFS server and your real login. You could even try something like: /media/nfs_server/$HOME/Documents, but it depends of your server directories.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Does the Search field on the launcher in kde depend on Nepomuk? Does the search field on the application launcher depend on Nepomuk?\nI had to disable Nepomuk on shared systems because it takes too much CPU and I/O and I have noticed that on some systems the search field for programs does not show newly installed programs.

If I press the upper button, it immediately fires a right mouse click. I want it to fire when I press the upper button and than tap the pen on the Wacom.\nHow can I enable these two functions for my Wacom on Ubuntu?\n\nA: I was able to fix the hover click by setting the property TabletPCButton to 'on'.\nThis can be done using xsetwacom device_name TabletPCButton on (note that xsetwacom is only runtime changes, so a script with the xsetwacom has to be run on startup). \nThe scrolling can be enabled Ubuntu wide (not only in the browser), by installing EasyStroke and configuring it to recognize the scroll movement and map it to a scroll movement. \nThis has also worked for me in Ubuntu 13.10 and 14.04.\n\nA: There is a Firefox add-on that does just that, works straight out of thebox and there is a bunch if setting for tweaking the add-on:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/grab-and-drag/?src=search\nI am also looking for a way to disable hover click.\n", "Q: Running native ubuntu installation from fusion or parallels my intention is to buy a macbook (retina) and triple boot it, with osX, w7 and ubuntu (>= 12.04, i still have to see which one offers the best compatibility).\nI found guides that explain how to do it without using the hybrid MBR, since all of these OSes are GPT aware. So far so good.\nHowever, i would like to be able to run either of the two additional OSes both natively and virtualized.\nThis means that the virtual machine (parallels, fusion or virtualbox) will be requested (by me) to run the OS from the physical partition.\nNow, i already tried this with Windows 7 on a macbook, and it works nicely, without messing up anything (means i can boot one day from parallels, the next day natively, and everything is fine, even after installing parallels additions or whatever they are called).\nMy question is about ubuntu. I have not tried it, but i can reasonably expect that some things, for example the video drivers, are different in the two modes.\nSince these settings are normally stored in files (xorg.conf, for example), how easy is to interchangeably boot a native ubuntu both natively and virtualized?\nPS: i know there will be some answers like \"why do you ever want to do that?\" or other non constructive  comments.\nThe reason why i want to do this is because we all know that these alternative OSes do not play nicely with the battery of the mac, when ran natively.\nSo i want to be able to run them from osX when i will be on battery, to extend the usage range.\nOn the other side, i want to be able to run natively these OS in order to use the graphic hardware directly (GPGPU and stuff like that)\nupdate:\nI was also wondering: does parallels or fusion allow the guest to mount a physical partition (obviously if not mounted on the host)?\n\nA: I am doing this to my macbook now,  fresh Macbook Pro i7 - Mountain Lion.  \nI will post the steps I take.\n", "Q: How to make all filetypes open in a certain program? I want every filetype to open in Leafpad.\nI tried to edit /usr/share/applications/defaults.list to associate file types.\nBut I want all filetypes to open in a certain program, with maybe something like \\*/*=leafpad.desktop\nHow to do it?\n\nA: One method could be to go to System settings > Details > Default applications:\n\nAnother method can be to right click on the file that you want to associate with a program and select Open with (> Other application...) or select Properties > Open with  tab (I think this is the best option) and the rest is pretty self-explanatory. If you, for example, set one MP3 to be opened by the program VLC, then all MP3s would be opened by VLC when double-clicked.\nAnd finally (but not the last one), and, in fact, this I think is what you are looking, another method could be to use assoGiate program - a file types editor. To install it from Terminal, use next command:\nsudo apt-get install assogiate\n\n\n\nA: For me, with gnome applications like Dolphin, editing my ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list under the  [Default Applications] section I added application/octet-stream=ghex.desktop;\nGHex is now an option with unassocated and \"Open With\" for associated files.\nAlternatively on a global scale I edited the ghex .desktop file /usr/share/applications/ghex.desktop as root/sudo to add the line MimeType=application/octet-stream; anywhere (at the end)\nI, too, thought */* should have worked but it doesn't.\n", "Q: How to fix Ubuntu server 13.04 slower boot when network cable is unplugged I have noticed that when I unplug the network cable, system waits about 100 seconds to configure the network, So I edited /etc/init/failsafe.conf and comment two wait() lines (thanks to tutorial here)\n# Plymouth errors should not stop the script because we *must* reach\n# the end of this script to avoid letting the system spin forever\n# waiting on it to start.\n    $PLYMOUTH message --text=\"Waiting for network configuration...\" || :\n    #sleep 40\n\n    $PLYMOUTH message --text=\"Waiting up to 60 more seconds for network configuration...\" || :\n    #sleep 59\n    $PLYMOUTH message --text=\"Booting system without full network configuration...\" || :\n\nThen I grab a timer and start counting seconds of boot time, the odd thing is it takes 15 more seconds to boot a system with an unplugged network cable that a system with a plugged network cable. and most of the delay is in this line that appears on start up :\nthe disk driver for servername--vg-swap1 not ready\n\nMy home folder is encrypted and Ubuntu has been installed with LVM.\nMaybe you say \"so what harm can come from 15 more seconds of delay?\" Well, I am configuring this server to be used in a traffic control system and in case of power failure the system should be back on its feet as soon as possible, so every second counts.\nThank you.\n\nA: Do you have eth0 set up to be automatic by DHCP?  Look at /etc/network/interfaces (it's a file, not a folder)\nIf your entry looks something like this:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nthen that large delay is because your system is trying to run DHCP, even though the network cable is unplugged, which means it runs through all of the channels until it gets a response, which it never will because it's not plugged in, so it takes a while.  If it's plugged in, this is much faster because it should get a DHCP offer fairly quickly.\nThat would be the best explanation I can think of.\n\nA: If you insist on speeding up your boot time, you should boot with nothing running. After the system is up and running then enable devices and system applications. \nSet the machine to boot to console only with no networking, then in rc.local set a script to sleep a while then enable networking and other services. You should be able to \"boot\" in under 5 seconds (after grub hands off) on good hardware. \nHowever, based on your comments, this is not the best answer. If \"server\" portion would be 100% useless without a network, and your \"workstation\" portion would be 100% useless without a network (you said web app). So your fast booting Linux box would still be 100% useless for longer then if you booted normally. Also if you using \"normal\" server hardware you probably spend much more time on pre-bootloader setup and posting then you do in Linux boot.\nAlso if your server is running critical software you should cluster with two or more and a long boot time should matter. \nIn short, changing the boot order in this way, while booting faster, will almost certainly take longer to recover from a outage. \nIf your trying to speed up network access then disabling DHCP and using a static IP should help. Also consider that even with \"the plug in\" spanning tree algorithms  on the switch may take a while before you get real network access.  \n", "Q: g++ fails to link to libmysqlclient I use Ubuntu 12.04 on a virtual machine on my MacbookPro.

The GUI allows exactly ONE keybinding\n  to be assigned to each action. In dconf, you can set an array of\n  bindings for a single action.\n\nQuick research lead me to Ubuntu's Wiki:\n\nThe keybindings that are handled by the window manager support\n  multiple keys that will perform the same action. The\n  gnome-control-center GUI does not support it, but you can make it work\n  using dconf-editor. For example to have \"Close window\" use both the\n  traditional F4 as well as an easier to hit Pause/Break button,\n  change org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings close to ['Pause', 'F4'].\n\nAnyway my attempt to set volume control  to CTRL+SUPER++  and my laptop's media key via\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys volume-up ['<Primary><Super>KP_Add', 'XF86AudioRaiseVolume']\n\nresults in an error for invalid value while wrapping the array in quotes does not trigger an error but assigns no function to any of the keys neither. (I assume Ubuntu 12.04 might not having received an update in this regard).\n\nA: I spent a while looking into this, and unfortunately the answer seems to be \"no\".\nStephen Ostermiller did some excellent research into keyboard shortcuts, which you can read in his answer, here: Where are GNOME keyboard shortcuts stored?\nThat led me to the dconf-editor utility, where I found the relevant settings:\n\nAs you can see, my preferred shortcuts for switching workspaces are Alt1, etc. The square brackets around the Value led me to think that it might allow an array of values, but I although I was able to change the shortcuts via this value, was unable to get more than one to work. It would only use the first which one I defined.\nBut for anyone who finds this answer while trying to figure out how to set shortcuts for switching workspaces, I should point out that the easiest way to do it is via the GUI. In Unity, bring up the System Settings editor and navigate to Hardware > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Navigation.

Background:\nI'm changing a lot of desktop environments every day, and i'd like to some uniformity between them to keep my productivity up.\nSo, which window-manager can be installed in Ubuntu that has most similar functionality, usability to ms-Windows?\ne.g.: open/save file dialog, alt-tab behavior, main key bindings.\nIs there such a window manager?\n\nA: There may be others but I'd say you'd struggle to find anything better for your purpose than KDE.\n\n\n*\n\n*You start with something that looks most like Windows already.\n\n*You can customise just about everything, very easily.\n\n*There are even themes that make it look like Windows.\n\n*Window-switchers (alt-tab) are configurable too.\n\n\n\nOn a slightly different note: I have found that it does sometimes help to keep things different if they operate differently. Stuff like having the minimise/maximise/close buttons in the same place makes sense but if your launchers work differently, keeping them visually disparate means you won't accidentally do the wrong thing.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04 wired connection is not working After upgrading to 13.04 I can't make wired connection work (wireless internet works fine).

My dad's new HP Pavilion dv6 laptop running Ubuntu 13.04 takes almost a minute to boot up - it seems like it's hanging somewhere. Is there something I can do to easily fix it?\nI need some help deciphering the bootchart. Here it is: \n\nFor better browsing: http://i.imgur.com/u4XCi05.png\n\nA: I usually don't see anything obvious on these things but here I do: Landscape.\nThere is a cluster of Landscape-related processes and one of these triggers lshw. These processes account for a massive amount of CPU use. In my mind they're almost certainly making the difference between 60 seconds and 30, maybe even 20 seconds.\nAssuming you have support from Canonical (Landscape being a Canonical Support feature), I'd have a really serious moan at them directly. If you don't need it, remove it and try again.\n\nIf you need it and you can't get Canonical to fix it, all I can really suggest is you suspend or hibernate instead of shutting down. Depending on your machine, suspend can actually be pretty alright. Our second-gen i3 laptop will last for about 4 hours on power but will sustain ~96 hours on suspend (usually enough to get to a power supply).\n\nAnd all an SSD is going to do is speed up the disk stuff. If you look at the second graph, you can see the first third is the only part that's doing any disk throughput. I'm not saying they're not good - they're awesome - but they're not going to fix your problem.\n\nA: Well Buy a SSD...

But I do not know how to send those form contents to my boss in her email address!!\nI love ubuntu and am Enjoying it and am a beginner!\nwould any one please help me??\nThank you so much! \nJoye\n\nA: Start with installing a MTA. This lets PHP send the email from the server.\nsudo apt-get install postfix\n\nThen in PHP it's fairly simple. Use the mail command:\nmail('address@example.com', 'Form submission', $_POST['message']);\n\nThat assumes there was a form element with the name message in the form. It also assumes your form is (as it should be) <form method=\"post\" ...>.\n", "Q: There is any application that can be used to monitor for much time a computer is turned on? I need an application that monitor how much time the computer is turned on. For example if I start the system at 12:03 AM and shut it down it at 3:16 PM and then in the same day I turn it on at 4:54 PM and shut it down at 7:47 PM, it would save this data so it could be reviewed later.\nDo you know any application that perform such task?\n\nA: You can use uptimed which does exactly that. It's a daemon to record uptime records.\nInstall it by running following command in your terminal:\nsudo apt-get install uptimed\n\nOnce installed you can use uprecords command to check your uptime records.\n\nA: You can use uptime, and put a simple script like uptime >> /home/user_name/.uptime into /etc/init.d/ and then make a symbolic link to it on /etc/rc0.d/, note that the script need to start with K99.\nFor more information on how to execute scripts before the system shut down see How to execute script on shutdown?.\n", "Q: symbol lookup error: undefined symbol: _gfortran_internal_malloc64 Ubuntu 13.04 here.\nI was trying to use a program called smartpca and the first time I tried to use it, it raised a dependency error about a liblapack.\nI installed libatlas3-base and it was solved.

Based on the answer on How to programmatically change the launcher's hide behaviour I tried to make a python script to do the job. Then I should just figure out how to run that with a keyboard shortcut.\nMy script looks like this:\n#!/bin/python\nAUTOHIDE=$(dconf read /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/launcher-hide-mode)\nif (AUTOHIDE==1):\n   dconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/launcher-hide-mode 0\nelse:\n    dconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/launcher-hide-mode 1\n\nBut running the script from a terminal (doing 'python scriptname.py' ) doesn't work. I get a \"invalid syntax\" error at $ sign.\nYou have to know that I have almost no knowledge of python (or writing scripts in general). (I've just spent a few hours searching the web for help and examples).\nSo the actual questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What did I do wrong?\n\n*Did I chose a way to complicated approach for this and how can I do it more easily in that case?\n\n\nA: If you want to do it Pythonic way.\n#!/bin/python\nimport subprocess\nAUTOHIDE = subprocess.check_output ([\"/usr/bin/dconf\", \"read\", \"/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/launcher-hide-mode\"])\nif (AUTOHIDE==1):\n   subprocess.call ([\"/usr/bin/dconf\", \"write\", \"/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/launcher-hide-mode\", \"0\"])\nelse:\n   subprocess.call ([\"/usr/bin/dconf\", \"write\", \"/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/launcher-hide-mode\", \"1\"])\n\nyou have to execute the programs by creating a subprocess.\nAnd this is the bash script version\n#!/bin/bash\nAUTOHIDE=$(dconf read /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/launcher-hide-mode)\nif [[ $AUTOHIDE -eq 1 ]]\nthen\n   dconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/launcher-hide-mode 0\nelse\n   dconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/launcher-hide-mode 1\nfi\n\nThe shortcut can be assigned like this.\n\nA: One way to do it simply is to create a custom shortcut.\nAccess System Settings > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Custom shortcuts\nThen click '+' to add a new shortcut, and in the command box paste:\ndconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/launcher-hide-mode 0\n\nThis will create a shortcut for showing the launcher. Now to hide the launcher, you should create another shortcut adding the command:\ndconf write /org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/unityshell/launcher-hide-mode 1\n\nOf course, now you'll have one command for each function, but I put them side by side and find it very intuitive.\n\nA: For Unity 2D the dconf lines should be\n/com/canonical/unity-2d/launcher/hide-mode\n\nThere is also a third mode “Intellihide” whose value is 2.\n", "Q: Java doesnt work if used from gnome When I try to install something( which uses InstallAnywhere) from terminal in gnome I got something like that:\nPreparing to install...\nExtracting the JRE from the installer archive...\nUnpacking the JRE...\nExtracting the installation resources from the installer archive...\nConfiguring the installer for this system's environment...\nNo Java virtual machine could be found from your PATH\nenvironment variable.

Do i have to create a new folder in /usr/share and change all references to the new version or is there a better way?\n\nA: Just download the .zip, extract it, and run bin/idea.sh. Your previous settings etc should be retained when you run the new version. \nIf oracle jdk/jvm is not available on the path, you may need to specify the path to it directly. Place the following in idea.sh, as the first line:\nexport IDEA_JDK=/usr/lib/jvm/jdkxxxxx\n\n(Put your own path to the jdk in there)\n\nA: Intellij requires root permissions for the built in update function to work.\n\n\n*\n\n*Either start using sudo:\nsudo /opt/intellij-idea-ce/bin/idea.sh\n\nor give all users the ability to update Intellij, then start as yourself:\nsudo chmod -R o+rw /opt/intellij-idea-ce\n/opt/intellij-idea-ce/bin/idea.sh\n\n\n*Then restart the IDE, click 'Help', 'Check for updates...'\n\n\nA: Use JetBrains TOOLBOX.

It appears as a document with a lock on the top right corner and cross on the bottom right corner.  \n\n\nNow the document folder is not opening. it also shows that it's not a folder.  \nHow can I revert back to the original document folder?  \nIf you want I could send screen shots of the problem.\n\nA: You could try to:  \n\n\n*\n\n*First, using the menu actions you have already described, move the document folder to an alternate location.  \n\n*For example, you could create a new subfolder on the desktop, or within another path, or perhaps on another drive.\n\n*Then, once the document folder has been removed from your desktop, you could move it again, from the alternate location, back to the desktop.\n\n\nAlso, some other things you could look at, and try:\n\n\n*\n\n*View the desktop folder in a file browser or command-line shell to see if document shows as a folder or not.  \n\n*On the desktop, try to rename the document folder to some other name to see if it is restored to be accessed as a folder.  \n\n\nIn the end, if this functionallity has been corrupt, you may have to create a new user and move (or copy) all your existing home/desktop files to the new user, and then delete the \"corrupt\" user.\n", "Q: CurlFTPFS Not allowing users to change files I have installed curlftpfs as per instructions I found on the net. I am mounting it in my fstab file using this command:\ncurlftpfs#ftp://user:pass@IP /media/FTP fuse rw,uid=1000,umask=0777,user,suid,allow_other,exec,auto,utf8  0   0\n\nProblem is that my user cannot edit anything in this folder. I can view anything I want, but I cannot edit anything. Anytime I try to edit something I get access denied errors.\nWhat would I need to change to allow any user on my system to edit files mounted here?\n\nA: Figured it out changing permissions and umask. umask should be 002 according to this nice tutorial here:\nhttp://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/understanding-linux-unix-umask-value-usage.html\nThen I have to also specify what group ID I desire when mounting. I also found out that during boot this sometimes doesn't work because of the network, so I had to add _netdev to allow it to mount after the network.\nAll works now. So the final line for the fstab file is:\ncurlftpfs#ftp://user:pass@IP /media/FTP fuse rw,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=002,user,suid,allow_other,exec,auto,utf8,_netdev  0   0\n\nOf course replacing uid and gid with your user ID and group ID for your user. After this little change though it works perfectly using sudo mount -a or at boot.\numask was the big thing, unless both user and group had write permissions it wasn't working for me. So 0022 doesn't work for umask since that makes user writeable but not group. For some reason without group it just wouldn't work.\n", "Q: Booting Ubuntu 13.04 i386 from USB, main OS is Windows 7, VAIO S Series, VPCS149FJ I'm also one of the newbies at Ubuntu and I intend on installing Ubuntu 13.04 Desktop i386 on my USB using Universal USB Installer, with some basic information provided on\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\nwhich doesn't, unfortunately, provides me with information about what to do after creation. Do I just shut down, plug the USB in, start up, interrupt normal booting, choose booting device which is the USB, and done?\nEven if this succeeds, when I shut down in Ubuntu, do I start up at Windows 7 the next time?\nWhat is the difference between 'trying' Ubuntu and 'installing' Ubuntu? I've heard that it's possible to perform an installation on a USB. How?\nA LOT OF INFO is appreciated!!! Thanks in advance!!! \n\nA: Once you create the USB, you need to boot from it.  Just change the boot order in your BIOS to boot from USB.  \nSince you have Windows 7 installed already, when you get to the installation screen, choose alongside Windows.\n\nTrying Ubuntu lets you run Ubuntu fully, but without making any changes to your system, while installing will do changes to your system, depending on the type of installation you choose.\n", "Q: Cannot get mysql to work/start even after clean install I am completely stumped right now, whilst I am not an advanced user, I know my way around Ubuntu and so tried to look into things with the help of certain forum topics.\nThe Problem:\nToday, quite randomly, mysql stopped working on my local laptop.

Should I install the server version of ubuntu 10.04 and install X on top of that? Would what work for support? I love 10.04 only because it runs very smoothly on my netbook. 12.04 and 1304 are very slow on my machine.\n\nA: From a recent post  on the ubuntu-announce mailing list \nUbuntu announced its 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) release almost 3 years ago,\non April 29, 2010.  As with the earlier LTS releases, Ubuntu committed\nto ongoing security and critical fixes for a period of 3 years on the\ndesktop. The support period is now nearing its end and Ubuntu 10.04\nDesktop will reach end of life on Thursday, May 9th.  At that time,\nUbuntu Security Notices will no longer include information or updated\npackages for Ubuntu 10.04 Desktop.  Ubuntu 10.04 Server continues to\nbe supported for another 2 years.\n\nWhat I understand from this is that only the server edition remains supported.  The server does not contain any desktop so the desktop packages will not be supported or any application that runs on a desktop.\nIn practise I suspect that the repositories will not be moved until the server stops being supported in April 2015 but there will no further updates for bug fixes or security patches.\nI would recommend you upgrade to 12.04.\nThere are several versions of Ubuntu available and while it is true that Ubuntu 12.04 and 12.10 with the Unity desktop are slow on older hardware it is not the only desktop available.\nThe Gnome Classic desktop is the closest to the desktop as it was in Lucid and instructions on how to install it can be found here.\nHow to revert to GNOME Classic Desktop?\nIn my experience both Lubuntu and Xubuntu work well on older machines and I would recommend either of these in preference to continuing with a soon to be unsupported release.\nXubuntu is LTS and 12.04 is supported till April 2015.\nLubuntu is not LTS: 12.10 is supported till April 2014 and 13.04 till Dec 2013.\n\nA: You could also consider changing to Lubuntu, which, although will require some adaptation on your part (it runs LXDE and not GNOME as desktop environment), you can customize with your preferred applications and keep up to date.\nFor example, in my old laptop I work without much problems with LibreOffice, Octave, Gimp, LaTeX, gvSIG, etc.\nAs @Web-E correctly points out, Ubuntu Server does not have a desktop environment by default, so you would have to install one, which I imagine would lack the support as it would be probably coming from the Ubuntu 10.04 Desktop repositories.\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on an MDR disk - problems! I have an MDR disk with Windows 8 installed and system reserved partition. I have tried installing Ubuntu from both disk and USB, and it just cannot pick up on my partition table either way. It thinks I have an empty disk.\nI tried formatting, installing Ubuntu, and then Windows, but the exact same problem happened - Windows could only see an empty disk. When I have Windows installed, Windows installation media can see my partitions fine, and the same with Ubuntu.\nI'm guessing this is because my Windows disk refuses to install in UEFI, and my Ubuntu disk refuses to install in BIOS. Why is this? I thought that either could install either way without a problem.\nIn my boot menu, I am offered two options:\n\n\n*\n\n*SanDisk\n\n*[UEFI] Sandisk\n\n\nI assumed that the UEFI selection would install Ubuntu in UEFI, whereas the option without it would install in BIOS. They both seem the same to me, though - maybe I'm just being stupid.\n\nA: A disk that shows up as empty in the Ubuntu installer but that you know holds partitions is usually a symptom of one of two problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*Leftover RAID data on a disk that's no longer being used for RAID. You can often get rid of such data by typing sudo dmraid -r -E /dev/sda; however, you should be 100% positive that you're not using RAID before you do this. Some computers come configured to use RAID, even for just one disk, and removing the RAID data in such situations without first disabling RAID in the firmware can cause problems.\n\n*Damage to the partition table. On an MBR disk (is that what you meant when you wrote \"MDR disk\"?), my FixParts program can often fix these problems, but that's not 100% guaranteed. If you've got a GPT disk or if FixParts doesn't help, you should post back with more information, such as the RESULTS.txt file created by the Boot Info Script.

You will have to install Ubuntu into another drive to get all the benefits of a full install. The second drive can be another USB drive.See How do I install Ubuntu to a USB key? (without using Startup Disk Creator) for how to do a full install of Ubuntu in an USB drive. In particular, follow the answer by Cumulus007. Read the other answers too. The more you know the better it is.\nIf I understand you correctly, the computer currently does not have a hard drive. In that case, you need not worry about installing Ubuntu on the hard drive and wiping all the contents in the process.\nYou will need two USB drives. The Live USB can be 1GB. The second one should be at least 8GB or bigger as a complete install will take up more space. You will also need space for updating and upgrading the system, installing new software, as well as for your documents, pictures, music, etc. I have tried doing a full install in a 4GB USB and it was too small for the install to complete. I have a 16GB USB with full install.\nThere are two things you don't want in the full USB install.\nFirst, Normally, every time Ubuntu boots, GRUB the bootloader checks all the hard drives in the computer to see if there any other operating systems (OS) and adds them to the boot menu, so that you can choose the OS you want to boot from. You want your USB to be portable. That is, you may want to take it to a different computer and boot your own Ubuntu there. Every time you do that GRUB will add the OS of that computer to the list. So, if you boot your Ubuntu USB using 4 computers with XP, Vista, 7, and 8. Later you may see the choice to boot from all four even though your own computer does not have a hard drive and none of these OSs. \nTo prevent this from happening, do the following after you boot from your new full install USB. Open a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and type:\nsudo chmod -x /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober\n\nSecond, Do not create a Swap partition during install. By default, Ubuntu installation may create a Swap partition. This will require advanced installation option called \"Something Else\" and specify what kind of partitions to create during installation. See How to partition a disk for installing Ubuntu? for some instructions on how to create the partitions. The answer is a bit old and the images may not match yours but you will get the idea.\nYou should also disable swapping after installation. See reducing disk writes: swapiness=0 or swapoff better?\nAlso see the Swap FAQ at Ubuntu Community Documentation.\nHope this helps\n", "Q: How can I boot Windows 8 and Ubuntu 13.04 on a PC with an EFI bootloader?

If so, that's working the way it's supposed to work -- or at least, the way the Boot Repair tool is supposed to set things up. (It's not a very good solution, and I have more to say on the subject on my Web page. This is a problem with labels and with having too many options, not with an inability to boot Windows. If I understand correctly, the simplest solution is to ignore the issue and just use the awkwardly-named Windows boot option. There are several other options, though. Two that are relatively easy are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a tool called GRUB 2 Customizer to adjust the GRUB menu entries. I've never used this tool, though, so I can't provide further guidance on it.\n\n*Re-run the Boot Repair tool, click Advanced Options, click Restore EFI Backups, and click Apply. After doing this, install my rEFInd boot manager. This often does a better job launching Windows than GRUB does; however, it may have an extra boot option or two that you'll want to get rid of using rEFInd's own methods -- either deleting the offending files or using the dont_scan_dirs or dont_scan_files options in /boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf.\n\n\nIf I've completely misunderstood your post and you can't boot Windows from GRUB, then the first of these solutions won't do you any good -- at least, not without better understanding the problem and having a replacement GRUB boot stanza for Windows.

I have read many, many posts on this topic and tried many different tweaks to no avail. Reverting to an earlier version of pm_utils worked, but I lost the ability to put my laptop on standby, so that was no good. I decided it was time for me to do some analysis and try a few tweaks of my own. Well, it looks like I have come up with a successful work around that should work for any type of wireless card.\nI run Mint 10 and have the latest version of pm-utils installed - 1.4.1. tailing /var/log/pm-powersave.log reveals that /usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/wireless is called to put the wireless card into powersave mode when the power cord is removed. I found the specific section of code that makes that change is at the end of the script:\n\ncase $1 in\n    true) wireless_powersave on;;\n    false) wireless_powersave off ;;\n    *) exit $NA ;;\nesac\n\n\nI simply changed it to:\n\ncase $1 in\n    true) wireless_powersave off;;\n    false) wireless_powersave off ;;\n    *) exit $NA ;;\nesac\n\n\nThis results in the card never being put into powersave mode and has stopped the freezing.

The problem is not that MiB alignment was chosen; that's actually the correct alignment. (Selecting cylinder alignment would definitely be wrong.) When using MiB alignment, partitions are aligned to 1MiB boundaries -- that is, they start on sectors whose numbers are multiples of 2048. Since 2048 is a multiple of 8, this means that all partitions begin on multiples of 8, which is required for optimum performance on Advanced Format disks. Most modern hard disks are Advanced Format models, so as a general rule you should use 1MiB (or at least 8-sector) alignment on modern disks. For further information on this, see this article I wrote on the subject for IBM developerWorks.\nIf you check the start sector numbers, you'll see that they all align on 2048-sector boundaries, except for one: /dev/sda2. It seems that fdisk is now providing a warning about this, with its Partition 2 does not start on physical sector boundary message. This message is a false alarm. Yes, it's true that it doesn't fit on an 8-sector boundary (30001150 / 8 = 3750143.75); but /dev/sda2 is also an exception to the rule I've just laid out. It's an extended partition, which means that it's a placeholder for logical partitions. The speed problems associated with misaligned partitions occur because filesystem data structures are read and written in 4KiB (8-sector) chunks; but the only data accessed directly through /dev/sda2 is the pointer to the first partition it contains, and that's a 512-byte data structure, so it occupies only part of a physical sector no matter what the extended partition's start point is. What's more, this data structure is read once when the computer boots and is rarely written. Thus, it doesn't matter what the alignment is on extended partitions, and any tool that complains about their misalignment is causing concern without reason.\n\nA: It's no problem. I had the same situation on my box.  It works, and it didn't slow down.\nIt's because you can choose to align a partition to MiB or cylinder. Check with Gparted. If you choose a partition where no file system is mounted, you will see both options under resize/move. \nMaybe some older OS may be unable to handle misalignment.\nIf you want to fix it, you can redo your installation, and take care while partitioning your harddisk. Everytime choose the option to align to cylinder.\n\n", "Q: Problem installing gfortran I have just installed Ubuntu 13.04 on my computer, then tried to install gfortran using the command:\nsudo apt-get install gfortran\n\nin a terminal and it says:\nE: Unable to locate package gfortran\n\nHow to fix this?\n\nA: To install gfortran, make sure that universe repository is checked, and then\n\nJust press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal.

But when i tried to install it on Ubuntu 13.04 with this link giving me instructions: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WICD.\nBut when i installed it and everything it was asking me for a password for it to access my internet card..... but it wasn't my user account password and i couldn't get it to work at all. Can any of you help me in installing it or finding my password?\n\nA: First, I am not sure what information you want and thus not really sure WICD offers any more or less information then network manager.\nI assume the password you need to enter would be the password for the wireless network / router and not your user name or password.\n", "Q: Troubleshooting poor performance with ATI HD 5800 GPU I am attempting again to solve problems between ATI Radeon HD 5800 series (5830) GPU and Ubuntu.

How do I make all that data go onto that disk so I can have more space?\n\nA: If the 305 GB free space is right after the 10 GB partition, you can extend the latter to cover the former. If it isn't, one easy way would be to just move the /home directory to a new partition inside the free space, leaving the system in the 10 GB partition (which is not quite a lot, but could suffice). Of course, you can bring out /tmp too.\nYou can use fdisk, gnome-disks or gparted (easiest) to modify the partitions and reconfigure /etc/fstab without manually editing it.\n", "Q: Icons for custom mime-type does not show up with Ubuntu-mono-dark theme I manually installed LuxRender 1.2.1 under /usr/local/bin/ and it works fine and dandy. I then created 5 new mime-types for LuxRender *.lxs, *.lxo, *.lxm, *.lxv and *.flm file formats (scene, objects, materials, volumes and film). I created them with assogiate for convenience, however here is the simple generated Override.html file:\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<mime-info xmlns=\"http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info\">\n    <mime-type type=\"text/x-luxrender-scene\">\n        <glob pattern=\"*.lxs\"/>\n        <comment>LuxRender Scene</comment>\n    </mime-type>\n    <mime-type type=\"text/x-luxrender-materials\">\n        <glob pattern=\"*.lxm\"/>\n        <comment>LuxRender Materials</comment>\n    </mime-type>\n    <mime-type type=\"text/x-luxrender-objects\">\n        <glob pattern=\"*.lxo\"/>\n        <comment>LuxRender Objects</comment>\n    </mime-type>\n    <mime-type type=\"text/x-luxrender-volumes\">\n        <glob pattern=\"*.lxv\"/>\n        <comment>LuxRender Volumes</comment>\n    </mime-type>\n    <mime-type type=\"image/x-luxrender-film\">\n        <glob pattern=\"*.flm\"/>\n        <comment>LuxRender Film</comment>\n    </mime-type>\n</mime-info>\n\nThen, I ran update-mime-database ~/.local/share/mime, which updated the file mime.cache. The mime-types now works (both tested with mimetype and in the Nautilus properties panel of a file).\nNow I want to associate the icons (which come with LuxRender as 256x256 png files). I resized them to the apropriate sizes and put them under /usr/share/icons/hicolor/??x??/mimetypes. Finally, i refreshed the cache with sudo gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/hicolor.\nIf I open assogiate, it displays the correct icons even if I haven't explicitly defined them. However, Nautilus does not.\nSince I'm using Ubuntu-mono-dark (which however inherits from hicolor), I thought that it was because I had to put them under /usr/share/icons/Ubuntu-mono-dark too, or maybe /usr/share/icons/Humanity. However, this doesn't work neither.\nThe strange fact is that if I switch my theme to hicolor, the new icons actually shows up! This seems to suggest that they are installed correctly...\nDoes anyone have an idea about what is happening? Where do I have to put the icons? What should I configure?\nPS: just as a side note, I had the same problem with Mathematica icons...\n\nA: I fixed it. I installed them under gnome, Humanity, Humanity-Dark, ubuntu-mono-dark... and finally got it work. I really don't care to know how does this work...\nIt seems to me that the Inherits= line in index.theme does never fall back to hicolor.\n", "Q: 13.04; frequent freezes under gnome-shell, gnome, unity I just upgraded 12.10-->13.04 on my Dell Precision:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-1620 0 @ 3.60GHz\n\n*NVIDIA Corporation GT218 [NVS 300] (rev a2) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])\nI can login via gdm -- by default I use gnome-shell.  Within (I'd guess) 30-45 seconds the system freezes. And it really is frozen; e.g. if I'm logged in by ssh from my laptop, I'm frozen there as well.\nI get the same behavior when I choose in gdm to login using \"gnome (fallback)\" or  unity.\nBut if I Ctl-Alt F2 and login through the console, I have no freezing-difficulties at all.\nI've looked through /var/log/syslog*, and I do not see a culprit.\nI was not having any difficulties with 12.10.\nI was using xserver-xorg-video-nouveau, and I wondered at first if that was the culprit.\nSo I tried installing the nvidia-current (and the packages that dragged in). But this had no effect -- the freezing behaviour was the same (I've now changed back to nouveau - the console is nicer...)\nOne more data point, which is probably a red herring. I did the upgrade two days ago, and had problems more-or-less immediately. I noticed that a certain hardware sensor was starting up (psensor) each time I logged in, and its launch seemed to coincide with\nthe freezes I was having. So I logged in remotely and removed all the psensor packages.\nThings seemed better - for a day I had no freezes at all, so I thought I had solved the problem. But it has now returned.\nI suspect that my question is going to be closed and I'm going to be told to file a bug report, and I understand. But I still think there are some \"askubuntu\" questions here:\n\n\n*\n\n*For one thing: I don't know the culprit -- what should I file a bug report against? \n\n*And: I'm hoping for advice/suggestions. Would it help to try to use an older kernel? I haven't tried that yet (mainly because I suspect it would cause a big mess of \"apt\" related dependency problems). \n\nA: To report a bug to Psensor, please read: http://wpitchoune.net/psensor/doc/faq.html#S_BugReport\nI doubt Psensor itself can be the cause of a computer freeze. There might a bug that I am not aware causing a DE freeze but certainly not a kernel crash.\nIn the past, there was an access violation between the lmsensors library used by Psensor and the ACPI but AFAIK it is fixed in recent releases. See: http://www.lm-sensors.org/wiki/FAQ/Chapter3#Mysensorshavestoppedworkinginkernel2.6.31 .\nBTW, I guess it is not related to Psensor as you seem to say that after psensor removal the issue still exist.\nYou should first look at the log files in /var/log, mainly the syslog.* and dmesg.* ones after the crash occurs.\n", "Q: I don't see my Ubuntu's wallpaper I can't see my wallpaper I updated Nautillus and BAM!

Sometimes I see the following dialog.\nConfiguration file `/etc/...'\n ==> Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.\n ==> Package distributor has shipped an updated version.\n   What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:\n    Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version\n    N or O  : keep your currently-installed version\n      D     : show the differences between the versions\n      Z     : background this process to examine the situation\n The default action is to keep your current version.\n*** interfaces (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ? N\n\nMy question is only about terminology. What is the term for this method to ask the user, the term for this dialogue?\nOnce I have a technical term, it's easier to find information about it.\n\nA: Modify - It means you or a script edited a configuration file. For example, if you install mysql server and then you go and edit the /etc/myql/my.cnf file. The next time you do an upgrade and this upgrade includes mysql, when the mysql package starts to install it will detect you modified the my.cnf, so this message you got will appear. The change can be as simple as changing a variable in the config file.\nSelecting the D option will show you the difference between the modified file and the new one from the upgrade.\nFor the terminology about this package installing message, it will only appear if it detects a modified configuration file. From the Debian Handbook:\n\nRemember that during a package upgrade, the user gets to choose the\n  version of the configuration file that should be kept when a\n  modification has been detected. Any external modification of the file\n  would trigger that request, which would disturb the administrator, who\n  is sure not to have changed anything.\n\nSo there is no actual \"terminology\" but only a way of mentioning the act of. In this case, saying \"The modified dialogue when I do an apt-get upgrade\" or \"apt-get upgrade asks what to do in the modified message\" will be understood. At least by someone who has dealt with this question when upgrading.\n", "Q: Upgrade Problem with 12.04 I want to upgrade from ubuntu 12.04, but the update manager doesn't show me that any upgrades are available.

So you may consider a clean install. I mean, backup your system (system and data partitions), in case something goes wrong and you want to get back to your actual configuration. Download Ubuntu 13.04 an install it... If you have 2 partitions '/' and 'home' you can re-use them during the installation.

I don't know how to start debugging it, but when I play music using XBMC it sounds a lot better than when using Clementine. I know it is a little subjective, but although I love XBMC great features, Clementine has other qualities, like a better search.\nFirst my setup: my computer has a s/pdif coaxial output which I connect to my old Pioneer receiver. The receiver connects to my pair of speakers. \nI'm playing high quality MP3 files. \nIn Clementine -> Preferences -> General -> Playback I have configured:\n\n\n*\n\n*\"Choose automatically\" for the output plugin of GStreamer audio engine. \n\n*Album replay gain is checked, \n\n*Pre-amp is 0.0db. \n\n*Apply compression to prevent clipping is checked. \n\n\nXBMC has more configuration options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Audio ouput: Optical/Coax\n\n*Speaker configuration: 2.0\n\n*Boost volume level on downmix: checked\n\n*Dolby Digital (AC3) capable receiver: checked\n\n*DTS capable receiver: unchecked\n\n*Audio ouput device: default\n\n*Passthrough output device: iec958\n\n\nI've changed XBMC configurations from the default. It was \"analog audio\". The quality improved.\nUbuntu audio settings doesn't give me many options.\nI'm using Ubuntu 12.10, with default audio configuration.\nHow can I improve Clementine quality? References explaining what are all these options are welcome.\n\nA: I've upgraded Ubuntu to 13.04. XBMC also upgraded and now it sounds as bad as Clementine. Problem solved :-(\nBut, wait! After delving more in the problem, it looks like the guilty is on Pulse Audio, the newest Linux sound architecture that promised to solve all of your audio problems. \nAfter reading a lot and understanding a little, it looks like that PulseAudio decodes and re-encodes the audio signal degrading it. This long thread taught me a lot: Bit Perfect Audio in Linux.\nI've managed to get my high quality sound again configuring Clementine to directly access the Alsa S/PDIF channel. No resampling involved and the sound is a lot better. To do it, go to Tools -> Preferences -> Playback and change Output plugin to \"Audio Sink (ALSA)\" and the output device to the E958 direct hardware device.\nDiscover your own direct device with the command aplay -L. Here is a the relevant part of the command output in my computer:\ndsnoop:CARD=Intel,DEV=1\n    HDA Intel, ALC888 Digital\n    Direct sample snooping device\nhw:CARD=Intel,DEV=0\n    HDA Intel, ALC888 Analog\n    Direct hardware device without any conversions\nhw:CARD=Intel,DEV=1\n    HDA Intel, ALC888 Digital\n    Direct hardware device without any conversions\nplughw:CARD=Intel,DEV=0\n\nSo my outupt device is the \"direct hardware\" and digital. The key info is the \"Direct hardware device without any conversions\". You may have more than one, like one for your hdmi video port and another for your sound device.  I should fill it with hw:0,1(hw is the device, 1 is the DEV and I have no idea where the first zero comes from).\nSince nothing is easy, you should first turn off pulse audio and run Clementine this way:\npasuspender -- clementine\n\nVoilá! Now I've got high music quality. \nThe problem is that the spdif output was busy with Pulse audio. It looks like you can't share an alsa output. I've changed my setup.\nIn pulse audio I've changed my default sound output to Analog Stereo, and reconnected my old 2.1 speakers. Now every application will play to this channel. The SPDIF output is connected to my stereo and Clementine is hardcoded to use it exclusively. Don't forget to uncheck the \"Cross-fade\" preferences in Clementine so it doesn't have to share the channel with itself. \nNow my I can hear high quality music in my stereo and all other applications use the low fidelity computer speakers. \n\nA: I too had tinny audio after installing Ubuntu 16.04 on my early 2009 iMac.\n\n\n*\n\n*I went into System Settings (the gear and wrench in Launcher) and pulled up Sound.\n\n*The default output was Speakers with default mode Analog Stereo Output.\n\n*I changed the mode to Analog Surround 4.0 Output and voila! My audio through the speakers was perfect! I can make it go all tinny again by switching back to Analog Stereo Output.\n\n", "Q: Integrity check against package repository? When there are security updates, I review and install them as soon as possible and think about using automatic updates.\nFrom time to time I want to boot from a clean boot CD and check if the system has been compromised.\nFor that reason, I want to check if any packages / binaries have been modified, check the bootloader, check for rootkits.\nLet's suppose I booted from a clean boot CD and mounted the hdd filesystem.\nHow can I get list of all sha256 hash sums of all installed binaries and configuration files and check them against the versions from Debian repository?\nI have looked into intrusion detection systems (debsums,) Afick, AIDE, FCheck, Integrit, Osiris, OSSEC, Samhain, Tripwire, but they all have in common, that they want to create a known-good database before auditing. This doesn't scale very well, because updates are pretty frequent, which render that known-good database less useful. Re-creating the known-good database after updating isn't very safe either - let's say apt-get had a bug and installed a malicious package, then the checksum of that malicious package would end up in the known-good database.\nI think the real solution is checking against the distribution's package repository. How can I do that?\nI've checked http://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt#How_to_manually_check_for_package.27s_integrity already, but instructions are incomplete.\n\nA: For checking the integrity of an individual file in a package against the repositories, there's no easy way short of downloading the package. The repositories typically provide these files:\n\n\n*\n\n*Release{,.gpg}, InRelease - these provide the hashes of the Packages files.\n\n*The Packages file provides hashes of the packages.\n\n*The Contents file, where present, provides filelists of packages.\n\n\nThere's no file which provides the hashes of individual files - these are contained in the packages (DEBIAN/md5sums in the control archive).\nSo, if you don't trust the local system:\n\n\n*\n\n*You'll have to download the Contents file (if available).\n\n*Match the file to the package using that file and download the package.\n\n*Then use the md5sums to verify the file.\n\n\nIf a Contents file is not available, and you don't trust the local system, have fun downloading every package to see what provided the file.\nThis does not scale.\n", "Q: Upgrade MySQL server issue I failed to upgrade MySQL server.

I saw a few answers that give a very long procedure to install some drivers but they are very old.  The tablet works but there is no pressure sensitivity Not in Krita, MyPaint or Gimp.\n\nA: What version of Ubuntu do you have? It's likely that you already have the drivers you need. Ubuntu comes with Linux Wacom Project's Wacom Kernel driver (input-wacom), X driver (xf86-input-wacom) and libwacom xf86-input-wacom. I checked here and the Pro L seems to be one of the supported devices. \nYou can change the pressure settings for the stylus itself via command line (personally I have not gotten the GUI, in gnome-system-control, to work).\nCheck that the tablet is being recognized by your computer by opening Terminal or another CLI and entering:\n\nlsusb\n\n\nNow enter:\n\nxsetwacom --list devices\n\nThis should return a list of elements of your tablet that are configurable. In that list, you should be able to pretty easily identify which one is your stylus. It should look something like \n\nWacom Intuos L 6x9 Pen stylus     id: <XX> type: STYLUS\n\nwhere <XX> stands in for some number that gets assigned to that component. The part to the left of the id number is the name of the component, which you will call when changing  its settings, so you need to remember that. Please note that the name might not look exactly like what's above--the dimensions (6x9) might be different or not there at all, or it may be called Wacom Intuos L 6x9 Pen (without the \"stylus\")--use the specific name that you see listed in your Terminal output.\nSince you already know which specific property you want to edit, you don't need to go through the trouble of searching through all the possible parameters. You want to change the PressureCurve setting for your stylus:\n\nxsetwacom --set \"<NAME>\" PressureCurve 0 20 80 100\n\n\"xsetwacom --set\" tells your computer that you want to change the settings, the name of your stylus replaces <NAME>, PressureCurve is the specific property you're changing the values of, and \"0 15 85 100\" is just an example setting--this is the part you probably will want to tinker with. I ended up liking 0 12 92 100 for Gimp.\nFor reference, if you had zero sensitivity for your stylus (it's either \"off\" or \"on\"), the PressureCurve setting would be 0 0 100 100\nIf you wanted to see the other settings available to be changed, enter\n xsetwacom list parameters\n\nHowever, I suspect that the real issue that you're having is that within each program (like Gimp, Krita), you need to configure your tablet. I grabbed my boyfriend's tablet to test out my answer to your question, and at first I was stumped because I knew I had the drivers, that his tablet was supported, and the device was being recognized, but when I tried drawing in Gimp, changes in pressure were not having any effect.\nWith Gimp, you have to activate your tablet first. And while it isn't a highly technical process, it is a bit tedious. So I'm afraid my response is going to look really long, but it's not difficult to set this up, just a bit time consuming--I promise!\nGo to Edit > Preferences > Input Devices then click Configure Extended Input Devices. You should see the different elements of your tablet listed. From there you can click on the pen element of your Intuos, and you'll see a drop-down menu next to Mode. Change the mode from Disabled to Screen. You can edit the Pressure Curve here to change sensitivity settings. I also tried enabling the Pad element (from Disabled to Screen) and left the pressure curve alone--I liked the results better when the pad was disabled and only the pen was enabled, but I don't know know many of the nitty gritty details about how tablets work, and you may want to play around with how these two elements interact when they're both enabled.\nBeyond that, the tools in Gimp themselves have Dynamics options that can change the effect that input from your tablet has on what you're drawing. If you don't have a Tool Options dialog box open, open one up (I dock mine under my Toolbox). You should see a Dynamics section near the bottom. There are multiple profiles you can pick from, like Pressure Opacity, or you can add a custom one by clicking the button with the blue arrow and three red dots. This opens a drop-down menu of all existing profiles, and at the bottom of the list you'll see a plus sign button. Click that to make a new Dynamics profile. (See here for more info on Gimp/tablet use).\n\nI can't walk you through Krita tablet configuration, but here's a link to their documentation on using tablets with the program.\nI couldn't find a detailed walkthrough to tablet setup with MyPaint 1.2 (the newest version), but here's one for version 1.0. Unfortunately, I don't see your specific device listed in their supported devices list, although there are a lot of Wacom tablets in there.\nHere's a guide to setting up tablets with Inkscape. It's probably the most popular vector graphics software compatible with Ubuntu. I've used it and really liked it. \nFinally, you might also want to know that it's possible to write profile scripts so that the baseline pressure settings are different when you're using a specific program, like if you wanted lower pressure sensitivity when using Krita. You'd write a bash script that executes xsetwacom --set \"<NAME>\" PressureCurve X XX XX XXX, create an executable launcher for it, and click on the launcher before using Krita. More info can be found here.\nOther sources: linuxwacom github page and wiki. \n\nA: i had similar trouble getting pressure sensitivity working for the \"Wacom Intuos Bluetooth SM\" (CTL4100WLK0) on ubuntu 19.10 with the 4.20 kernel (also did not work on 5.5 and earlier 5.x kernels).  unfortunately the xsetwacom commands were successful but didn't result in pressure sensing.  (however, those commands did work perfectly for ubuntu 18.04)\nwhat worked for me was compiling the latest xf86-input-wacom driver from https://github.com/linuxwacom/xf86-input-wacom#what-is-xf86-input-wacom\ni followed the build instructions for ubuntu/debian here: https://github.com/linuxwacom/xf86-input-wacom/wiki/Building-The-Driver - thankfully it was a very straightforward build just copying and pasting the instructions.  \nonce the latest driver was built, no command line setting was required and pressure sensing worked perfectly in gimp.  furthermore, it also picks up the tablet as a separate drawing device rather than acting like a copy of the mouse/touchpad (eg, you can have a different brush selection on the tablet and the mouse at the same time) \ni suspect this will need to be done for the next LTS ubuntu 20.04 unless they incorporate the latest build of xf86-input-wacom in that release.  \n\nA: For me it was dead easy...\nProblem\nCouldn't get Wacom Intous tablet working properly in Inkscape.\nSolution\n\n\n*\n\n*Inkscape > Edit > Preferences > Input Devices\n\n*Select 'Wacom xxxxxxx Pen Stylus' \n\n*Select Mode Screen or Window\n\nPressure sensitivity worked perfectly after that!

Force-require root permission?\n\nA: I would assume you would need to set the owner of the bin file (of the program) to be root, and make it executable only by the root.\nSo, as an example, this is the current permissions on my nautilus, which is located in /usr/bin/nautilus:\nalaa@aa-UBUNTU:~$ ls -l /usr/bin | grep nautilus\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root   root       1542692 Feb 20 23:13 nautilus\n\nIn case you need to read more about permissions, click here. Also,\nbefore doing anything, remember the permissions of your program before you execute any commands, so that you can change back to those permissions should anything go wrong.\nNotice that there are three \"x\"s, which means that the owner, group, and other (basically meaning everyone) have access to execute it. If we want the application to require root permission, we need to set it up so that the root is the only one able to execute it, hence we need to remove the \"x\"s (which is the executable permission) from \"group\" and \"other\", and only leave the first \"x\". To do this, you would do:\nsudo chmod go-x /usr/bin/nautilus\n\nThis command means:\n\n\n*\n\n*chmod: change mode/permissions\n\n*go: apply the following to \"group\" and \"other\"\n\n*-x: remove (because of the minus sign) the executable permission from \"group\" and \"other\"\n\n*/usr/bin/nautilus: the file to apply this to\n\n\nSo we are removing the \"x\" from \"group\" and \"other\". Now, the permissions looks like this:\nalaa@aa-UBUNTU:~$ ls -l /usr/bin | grep nautilus\n-rwxr--r-- 1 root   root       1542692 Feb 20 23:13 nautilus\n\nIf I try to run nautilus with my username, I get this:\nalaa@aa-UBUNTU:~$ nautilus\nbash: /usr/bin/nautilus: Permission denied\n\nTo be able to run nautilus, I would have to do sudo nautilus.\n", "Q: How to set swap in /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume if I have two swap partitons?

What is the role of dependencies while installing any software?I was installing vlc player and it were closed by giving me error something like check dependency .\nWhat is to solution of this and how i'll get these dependencies??\nThanks in Advance.\n\nA: To install VLC player, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:videolan/stable-daily\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install vlc\n\nAs far as Package Dependencies:\n\nPrograms often use some of the same files as each other. Rather than\n  putting these files into each package, a separate package can be\n  installed to provide them for all of the programs that need them. So,\n  to install a program which needs one of these files, the package\n  containing those files must also be installed. When a package depends\n  on another in this way, it is known as a package dependency. By\n  specifying dependencies, packages can be made smaller and simpler, and\n  duplicates of files and programs are mostly removed.\nWhen you install a program, its dependencies must be installed at the\n  same time. Usually, most of the required dependencies will already be\n  installed, but a few extras may be needed, too. So, when you install a\n  package, don't be surprised if several other packages are installed\n  too - these are just dependencies which are needed for your chosen\n  package to function properly.1\n\n1Source:Ubuntu Help\nIf you have  .tar.gz file of VLC and you want to install, you just have to extract the file then compile from source.\ntar -jxvf filename.tar.bz2\n\nThis will create a folder in the same folder you extracted it, then you will have to compile it\nsudo ./configure\nsudo make\nsudo make install\n\n", "Q: In Ubuntu 13.04 backspace button in nautilus not working?

This was not enabled by default in previous versions of Ubuntu 12.04. To avoid this annoying pop-up, the Apport can be disabled by force. One drawback of doing it will be that you wont see the crash report but it is safe any ways as there is hardly any actual crash or error.\nSolution: If you seem that there isn’t any errors in your system, you may want to disable this error/crash report notification. You can do this by disabling the Apport error report notification tool, following next steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Ctrl+Alt+T to open a terminal and type the command: sudo -H gedit /etc/default/apport then press Enter to run the command.\n\n*From here the text editor apport will show up, change the value from 1 to 0 for enable variable to disable the apport. Save and exit the editor, then restart the system.\n\n\n\nYou can always re-enable it later on if you want, by changing \"enabled\" from \"0\" back to \"1\", or you can enable Apport temporarily, using the following command in a teminal:\nsudo service apport start force_start=1\n\nMore resources: Apport - What is this all about?\n", "Q: No route to host before ping I have a really strange problem with a netbook running Lubuntu and no Ipv6 configured, since I want to use only Ipv4.\nWhen I try to ping or connect to the netbook with any protocol with my laptop (Ubuntu 13.04 also with no Ipv6) in any way, I get the error:\n\nssh: connect to host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx port 22: No route to host\n\nI don't have this problem while connecting from my laptop to any other computer.\nNow the strange thing. If I ping my laptop from the netbook, everything gets OK and I can connect from there on without any problems. If I restart the laptop, the problem appears again.\nDoes anybody have an idea why this might be happening?\n\nA: Can you put the output of \"route\" command over here. Seems your machine is missing the default gateway, and that needs to be added. if in the output of route command you donot see a default gateway added, you should add it appropriately using sudo ip route add default via 192.168.1.254 or add it to the interface file by adding this line gateway 192.168.1.254 . then, do a networking restart. \nP.S. : Replace 192.168.1.254 with the appropriate IP of the default gateway of your network.

I want to run small untrusted programs, but restrict them from accessing any files outside of their folder, network access, and everything else that they don't really need. What is the simplest way to achieve this?\n\nA: mbox\n\nMbox is a lightweight sandboxing mechanism that any user can use without special privileges in commodity operating systems.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Source repo\nI've used it for a couple of things reliably. \n\nA: subuser\nYou can use subuser to sandbox your applications with Docker. This allows you do things like sandbox GUI apps, which isn't easy to do with Docker directly.\nsudo apt install subuser\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Using subuser - a quick tutorial\n\nA: If they are really untrusted, and you want to be sure, you'd set up a separate box. Either really, or virtually.\nFurther, you don't want that box to be in the same network as your important stuff, if you are paranoid enough. In all solutions you'd set up a separate user with no rights, so not to open too much tools to the would-be compromiser.\n\n\n*\n\n*So the safest option would be a separate box removed physically from your network.\n\n*You could give in a bit by adding it to the physical network, but on a different subnet: no 'real' connection inside\n\n*A virtual machine  would be an option, but might have to give up some performance\n\n\nIf you are bound on running it on the same box, you have for instance, this option\n\n\n*\n\n*chroot. This is a default option for doing this for lots of people, and for non-specific threats it might even work. But it is NOT a security option, and can be broken out of rather easily. I'd suggest to use this as intended, i.e. not for security.\n\n\nIn the end you might need to set up a specific sandboxing model without the hassle of virtualization or separate boxes, or the still-at-risk situation of chroot. I doubt this is what you meant, but look at this link for some more in-depth information.\n\nA: Firejail is fairly new and in constant development. Easy to use.\nYou can simply:\nsudo apt-get install firejail\nfirejail app\n\n\nA: Full virtualization/emulation (VirtualBox)\nOne possible solution is virtualization software such as VirtualBox which you can find in the software centre.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Virtual box\n\n*Create a virtual machine with networking enabled\n\n*Install Ubuntu or perhaps a lighter desktop such as Lubuntu\n\n*Fully update the installed OS (inside Virtual box)\n\n*Disable Networking on the virtual machine\n\n*Take a snapshot\n\n\nYou can now install the software you don't trust to see what it does.  It can't upset the outside world or you host OS as it does not have access.\nIt may trash your virtual machine however but if it does you can just restore from your snapshot.\nThere may be other methods to limit the destructive power of untrusted software but this is the most robust method I can think of.\nContainer-based virtualization (Docker/LXC)\nAnother option may be LXC more information here \nLXC is the userspace control package for Linux Containers, a lightweight virtual system mechanism sometimes described as “chroot on steroids”.\nLXC builds up from chroot to implement complete virtual systems, adding resource management and isolation mechanisms to Linux’s existing process management infrastructure.\nIt's available in the software centre.  I have no experience with however.\n\nA: Docker will help you to set up containers that you can run off of your current kernel, yet keep contained away from the rest of your system.  It seems pretty cutting edge but there's an Ubuntu focus an good documentation.\n\nA: I think, a possible solution is to create a separate user for testing purposes, and limit his privileges. This way you won't lose in performance, what would definitely happen in virtual machine, but I think this is less safe, if not set up very properly, which I can't advice on how to do. \n\nA: DoSH - Docker SHell\nIn case that you simply want to sandbox the activity of the users, you can use \"DoSH\"\n\nDoSH (which stands for Docker SHell) is a development to create Docker containers when users log in the Linux system and run a shell into them, instead of symply creating the shell.\n\n", "Q: unmet dependencies linux-server depend on linux-image-server on my Ubuntu server 12.04.2, LVM partition, I have this problem when I run apt-get -f install :\napt-get-f install\nReading package lists ... done\nBuilding dependency tree\nReading state information ... done\nCorrecting dependencies ... done\nThe following packages were automatically installed and are no longer needed:\n   linux-image-3.2.0-37-generic linux-headers-3.2.0-37 linux-headers-3.2.0-37-generic\nUse 'apt-get autoremove' to remove them.\nThe following extra packages will be installed:\n   linux-server\nThe following packages will be upgraded:\n   linux-server\n1 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 61 not upgraded.\n1 not fully installed or removed.\nIt is necessary to o 1736 in the archives.\nAfter this operation, 1024 o of additional disk space will be used.\nDo you want to continue [Y / n]? o\nReception: 1 http://fr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates/main linux-server amd64 3.2.0.41.49 [1736 B]\n1736 o approved in 0s (57.2 kB / s)\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of linux-server:\n  linux-server depends on linux-image-server (= 3.2.0.39.47), however:\n   The version of linux-image-server on the system is 3.2.0.41.49.\n  linux-server depends on linux-headers-server (= 3.2.0.39.47), however:\n   The version of linux-headers-server on the system is 3.2.0.41.49.\ndpkg: error processing linux-server (- configure):\n  dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nNo \"contribution\" report was created because the error message indicates an error running a previous failure.\n                           Errors were encountered while processing:\n  linux-server\nE: Sub-process / usr / bin / dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nI tried to download linux-server_3.2.0.39.47_amd64.deb and dpkg -i linux-server_3.2.0.39.47_amd64.deb but it says kernel already installed.\nAny idea ?

I strongly recommend upgrading to 12.04 which will be supported until April 2017.\n\n*You'll need to install the PPA after you've upgraded to 12.04 (which still ships 5.3.x) but it should work then.\n", "Q: Graphic card driver, Xorg (Open-source) version vs Proprietary (AMD and Nvidia) version, Which is the best? i would like to ask about the graphic card driver on linux.\nfrom on my experience here is, im having a laptop with a HD6320 from E-450 APU, which is belong to my friend and i install it an Xubuntu 13.10 on it (From what i know the default installation of some Linux Distribution, the Xorg driver for graphic cards will be installed by default. ), then i install a compiz and Docky included.\n.\nFirst try on it until a weeks it was good, the Docky hover movement is smooth and wobbly windows also. Then after i know that's all, i try to install the Proprietary driver one that been provided by AMD officially. after all the installation runs good and reboot, i notice at the Docky bar, some of transparent (Alpha) part having a black background and when i hover a some buttons on Docky, its lagging about maybe 5-20 fps. And the Wobbly Windows from Compiz did have some lag too, but i notice it that it isn't quite a big lag.\n.\nMy question in here based from my experience, does the Proprietary driver is really that bad? or it is just i am?.... And do you guys also have a same problems as mine with a different builds as mine?... Should i need to stick back again with Xorg driver (open-source)?\n\nA: Personally i keep 3 drivers installed (1 canonical and 2 proprietary) \nand switch between them depending on what i need at the moment.\nusually linux works best with Xorg driver, and also when you upgrade your linux distributive you can often run into big lags with proprietary drivers(like black screen, or X don`t starts at all after upgrade), so i switch to Xorg for any major updates to system.\nHowever for most games with decent graphics and some other graphic heavy software like 3d studios proprietary drivers work better, and some new games just don`t start on Xorg driver at all.\nwith \"additional drivers\" tool in dash menu and ability to add proprietary repositories to apt-get for AMD and NVidia alike it`s easy and fast.\n\nA: I use Xubuntu with an ATI Radeon HD 8600M, which has gave me several problems when I use the propietary driver. I have posted several question here regarding the issue (click my username to see the questions). They might help you. \nIn any case, it depends a lot of what you want to do. For example, I don't play videogames but I do use software which requires Open-gl via hardware, like Matlab. For this case, propietary software is much better (Matlab works faster). Yet, they generate other problems (for example, problems with lightdm in xubuntu...again, see my questions), which apparently have not a solution yet. I do pay the cost of this because I need Matlab, and I imagine the same would happen if you want to play demanding videogames. I guess the same is true with Compiz. \nIn the end, there is no perfect, or \"best\" option. Hopefully with time drivers will improve, but new issues will appear when new distributions with new components come out. At least that is my experience after 4 years using Ubuntu with ATI hardware.\n\nA: I have a laptop with the same APU, I stick with the open-source ATI driver.\nYou'd need catalyst only for \"serious\" games that won't run well on such a APU anyway. Also, ATI drivers have always been very buggy, both in Linux and in Windows!\nWith nvidia, things are different: the open-source driver is quite immature and has limitations but does its basic 2D desktop job. Most of the times you use the nvidia proprietary driver.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Update Manager is showing an error message The error message is as follows:\nCould not initialize the package information\nAn unresolvable problem occurred while initializing the package information.\nPlease report this bug against the 'update-manager' package and include the following error message:\n'E:Malformed line 57 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list (dist parse)'\n\n\nA: This means that there is something wrong with line 57 in your sources file.

I can see that gnome-screensaver is running.\n\nA: no, you don't have to uninstall gnome-screensaver, and install xscreensaver. You can just go to System Settings -> Brightness and Lock to setup the idle time of gnome-screensaver. \nThe gnome-screensaver can put your LCD monitor into low activity mode so it is the best for your monitor.\n\nA: Radu's answer is a good one so I won't duplicate it. I will point out extra steps recommended by the xscxreensaver developer. I'm also including a short paragraph of history from the developer.\n\n\nUSING GNOME OR UNITY\nFor the better part of a decade, GNOME shipped xscreensaver as-is,\n  and everything just worked out of the box. In 2005, however, they\n  decided to re-invent the wheel and ship their own replacement for the\n  xscreensaver daemon called \"gnome-screensaver\", rather than improving\n  xscreensaver and contributing their changes back. As a result, the\n  \"gnome-screensaver\" program is insecure, bug-ridden, and missing many\n  features of xscreensaver. You shouldn't use it.\nTo replace gnome-screensaver with xscreensaver:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Fully uninstall the gnome-screensaver package.\nsudo apt-get remove gnome-screensaver\n  \n*Launch xscreensaver at login.\nSelect \"Startup Applications\" from the menu (or manually launch \"gnome-session-properties\") and add \"xscreensaver\".\n  \n*Make GNOME's \"Lock Screen\" use xscreensaver.\nsudo ln -sf /usr/bin/xscreensaver-command /usr/bin/gnome-screensaver-command\nThat doesn't work under Unity, though. Apparently it has its own built-in screen locker which is not gnome-screensaver, and cannot be\n  removed, and yet still manages to be bug-addled and insecure. Keep\n  reinventing that wheel, guys! (If you have figured out how to replace\n  Unity's locking \"feature\" with xscreensaver, let me know.)\n  \n*Turn off Unity's built-in blanking.\nOpen \"System Settings / Brightness & Lock\";\nUn-check \"Start Automatically\";\nSet \"Turn screen off when inactive for\" to \"Never.\"\n\n\nDisclaimer\nI do not agree with the strong language of the developer but felt it better to include the history rather than hide it.\n\nUbuntu 18.04 special notes\nMany have complained when locking screen with Ctrl+Alt+L external monitors blank instantly and those with dpms are switched off. This causes unwanted delays when unlocking screen. Using xscreensaver will circumvent that particular problem.\nYou can decommission the Ctrl+Alt+L shortcut from gnome-screensaver and assign it to a new command for xscreensaver:\nxscreensaver-command -lock\n\nThis keyboard shortcut reassignment also works in Ubuntu 16.04.\n\nA: Starting with 12.04, Ubuntu doesn't ship with any screensavers, just a black screen that appears when your system is idle. If you’d rather have screensavers, you can swap gnome-screensaver for XScreenSaver.\nScreensavers were actually removed back in Ubuntu 11.10. Ubuntu uses gnome-screensaver and inherited the change from upstream GNOME. The GNOME developers think a black screen that puts your monitor into lower-power mode is optimal.\nInstalling XScreenSaver\nOpen a terminal and run the following command to uninstall gnome-screensaver:\nsudo apt-get remove gnome-screensaver\n\nInstall XScreenSaver and some additional screensaver packages with the following command:\nsudo apt-get install xscreensaver xscreensaver-data-extra xscreensaver-gl-extra\n\nConfiguring your screensaver\nAfter installation, perform a search in the Dash for Screensaver. Launch the Screensaver utility and use it to configure XScreenSaver and select your screensaver settings.\nThe Screensaver utility will prompt you to stop the gnome-screensaver process and launch the xscreensaver background process when you start it.\nBy default, XScreenSaver will choose a random screensaver each time it starts. You can specify the screensavers it chooses from or enable \"Only One Screensaver\" mode to always use your favorite screensaver.\n\nAdding to Startup\nTo actually use the screensavers, you'll want XScreenSaver to start in the background each time you log in. If it doesn’t start, it can’t notice your system is idle and launch screensavers.\nGet started by launching the Startup Applications utility from the Dash. Add a startup program with the following command. The name and comment here can be anything you like:\nxscreensaver -nosplash\n\n\nReverting Your Changes\nReverting these changes is simple. Just run these commands to uninstall XScreenSaver and reinstall gnome-screensaver:\nsudo apt-get remove xscreensaver xscreensaver-data-extra xscreensaver-gl-extra\nsudo apt-get install gnome-screensaver\n\nSource and more about: How to Add Screensavers to Ubuntu 12.04.\n", "Q: Make a program run in a terminal What command should I give to make a program run in a (new) terminal window? \nBackground:  I want to add another right-click option to Peazip which will pass the selected par2 file to the (installed) program par2, but I want it to run in a terminal, rather than the in the background.\nThanks.\n\nA: If you want to run a specific terminal emulator (e.g. xterm, konsole, gnome-terminal, etc.), just look for its command-line arguments.\nFor example, to run console utility htop in Konsole (KDE's default terminal), type:\nkonsole -e /bin/sh -c htop\n\n(You may want to add --hold argument to prevent Konsole closing immediately after process stops.)\nTo be more detailed: the above command runs konsole which runs /bin/sh interpreter inside itself, and the interpreter runs htop command inside itself.\nArguments of most popular terminal emulators are pretty similar, try these:\nxterm -e /bin/sh -c htop\nlxterminal -e /bin/sh -c htop\nxfce4-terminal -e \"/bin/sh -c htop\"\n", "Q: One O/S, 2 Machines quick question, Is it possible to share my Installation on my SSD between my main PC, and my laptop for when i go away, that way everything I need is still there, and dont have to worry about syncing files, programs, settings, etc. I tried this, but it has to reconfigure itself and then i have to go and reset all my driver settings each time i switch from one to the other, like is it possible to have say 2 kernels that i switch between depending on what im running off, and then select at grub when i boot up?\n\nA: Yes it is possible, but it might be a hassle in some cases.\nIf you just installed the base OS, using a text based log-in (no display drivers needed), make sure that the kernel has all the drivers for both systems (netwokr drivers etc) and that both use the same disk controller (e.g. both using SATA or eSATA) then this should work fine. Just pull the SSD from one machine, connect it to the other and boot.\nHowever...\nIf you use a different disk layout then you might need to edit /etc/fstab every time (e.g. to change /dev/da0 with /dev/ad0, moving from IDE to SCSI or USB) or vice versa. You can solve that in several ways, e.g. with manually running a script (E.g. create a  *prep_next__boot_for_laptop.sh* and remember to run it), or you might get away with mounting devices based on their block ID.\nIf you also use different graphical settings, sound setting etc etc then it might be easier to just create two separate OS installations and share the home folder. \nI prefer the last solution, though it means you have to keep two OS installations up to date,\n", "Q: Lenovo Y500 camera not working I am new to Ubuntu and linux in general.

Use vi for example:\nsudo vi /etc/profile.d/[file]\n\nwhere [file] is the name of the file that you edited (it cannot be /etc/profile.d because this is a directory).\nAnd I think that you should reset your PATH to default (because of gedit : command not found.):\nexport PATH='/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games'\n\nOther thing that you can do is when you are in tty1 to run this:\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER /home/$USER/\n\nYou can replace $USER with your actual username.\nTry logging in again.\n\nA: First of all profile.d is a directory, and you can't edit a directory.

I will have to install Quickly, create a Quickly project and change code just to see what your question is about and try to fix it, which I won't.\nThat being said, here is a minimal working example which behaves correctly, so my guess is Quickly does some magic somewhere which overrides this behaviour.\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk\n\nclass TestWindow(Gtk.Window):\n    def __init__(self):\n        Gtk.Window.__init__(self)\n        self.resize(400, 400)\n        self.connect(\"delete-event\", Gtk.main_quit)\n\n        ls = Gtk.ListStore(str)\n        ls.append([\"Testrow 1\"])\n        ls.append([\"Testrow 2\"])\n        ls.append([\"Testrow 3\"])\n        tv = Gtk.TreeView(ls)\n        tr = Gtk.CellRendererText()\n        col = Gtk.TreeViewColumn(\"Testcolumn\", tr, text=0)\n        tv.append_column(col)\n        sel = tv.get_selection()\n        sel.set_mode(Gtk.SelectionMode.MULTIPLE)\n\n        self.add(tv)\n        self.show_all()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    app = TestWindow()\n    Gtk.main()\n\nNote that you are using an incorrect treeselection mode in your question, the correct one is Gtk.SelectionMode.MULTIPLE.\n\nA: I found the solution to my own problem.\nThe 'can-focus' property of the Gtk.TreeView is set to False by default. Setting this to True fixes the strange selection behavior, as well as other strange behavior that might occur, like not being able to resize a column while its 'resizable' property is set to True.\n", "Q: Fonts and spacing seem to have changed after installation of a package To get WindowBuilder in Eclipse to work I had to install some dependencies.

I've now spent hours trying and failing to figure out how to install Ubuntu Desktop 13.04 on my new desktop while setting up RAID as part of the installation.\nI tried following the following two tutorials:\nhttp://www.michielovertoom.com/linux/ubuntu-software-raid/\nhttp://blog.foobaria.com/2010/05/installing-ubuntu-1004-desktop-with.html\nEach time the installation ends with a pop-up error saying something about \"'grub-install dummy' failed\".\nIt's a PC with a pair of 120gb SSDs.  It would be cool to have /boot on the mirror, but not essential.  I've tried both that, and having a separate unmirrored /boot partition with the rest of the disk space dedicated to a mirrored root (/) partition (the two tutorials cover both approaches between them).\nHelp?\nPS-It's annoying that this isn't yet a simple checkbox option during install, the way home dir encryption became a few years ago.  Also, the awesome Alternate distro is no longer available for recent releases.\nPPS-I've seen some people say to use 13.04 Server or 12.04 Alternate installer, then upgrade to 13.04 and install a desktop manually (if starting with Server).  Is that a straightforward and safe way to end up with the equivalent of having installed Desktop 13.04 in the first place?\n\nA: Install using a Server CD.\nIt's a bit tricky, but it's possible.\nFollow this Ubuntu community tutorial and you'll be just fine.\nAfterwards, you can just add a Desktop.\nGood Luck !!\n\nA: Even though this thread is a bit old...\nI've found that the tutorial posted by Mike is missing a step.\nAfter \"Installing\" step 6, you need to set up the mount point for the RAID device.  Otherwise, you will get an error saying \"no root file system is defined\".  This can be done by the following steps:\n\n1. Select \"#1\" under the \"RAID1 device #0\" partition.\n\n2. Choose \"Use as:\". Then select \"swap area\", then \"Done setting up partition\".\n\n3. Next, select \"#1\" under the \"RAID1 device #1\" partition.\n\n4. Choose \"Use as:\". Then select \"Ext4 journaling file system\".\n\n5. Then select the \"Mount point\" and choose \"/ - the root file system\". Change any of the other options as appropriate, then select \"Done setting up partition\".\n\nFinally, select \"Finish partitioning and write changes to disk\".\n\nThese steps are included in a more thorough tutorial found: Advanced Installation Tutorial\n\nA: Though this post is a little bit old, Here is another solution, which is, in my opinion, the best (I have tried install with a server edition, and it is simpler with this other tuto):\nHave a look at this post, and a more accurate one at its answer:\nHow to Install Ubuntu 14.04 with RAID 1 using desktop installer?\nBUT this post is to use the ONLY RAID array. If you want, as I did, to use the RAID array only as a /home for example, and the rest of files on another device (for example, a usb stick with grub, / and the swap, and the /home on the RAID array) you can do this tuto, but you can use the graphical installer. At the end of ubuntu installation, choose to continue testing, and do the chrooting, but there's no need for all the GRUB stuff (you simply put it on the USB stick during the installation).\nHope it helps!\n", "Q: NEW TO LINUX Desktop doesn't look right I burned Ubuntu 13.04 to a DVD and booted it on an Intel Pentium III desktop. On live disc boot, the log in screen looked fine and, once logged in, the bar across the top and the applications dock along the side look fine, but the desktop wallpaper looks odd. the colors are inverted and horizontally squished, resulting in two side-by-side identical desktop images, interaction is different. if I want to click on one of the two options which appear- a folder icon labeled \"Examples\", and a Drive icon with the Ubuntu logo and a arrow on it labeled something like \"install Ubuntu\" (these icons and their text are also effected by the psychedelic effect), I have to imagine about where they would lie if the screen where rendered correctly. the same with the drop down menus from the icons in the top right corner and any windows i try to pull up; each window as a whole takes up the amount it would be expected to, and the bar across the top of the window looks fine in normal color, but the content of the window will have a green tint and will either squish and double side by side like the desktop and sometimes have a weird counter clockwise slant. \nI then tried booting into another option within the boot menu in hopes of different results. The second on from the bottom (i think it started with a \"K\"...?) booted and automatically gave me the install prompt. thinking it were an issue associated with the live disc boot, i installed it to the hard drive, and stupidly replaced the Windows XP Professional install. I was then able to boot into Ubuntu without the disc (of course), and the problem persisted. I tried to access the boot menu by holding shift while booting, but that hasn't worked.

So far I have a ISO to USB file downloaded onto my hard drive. When I try to copy it to my USB, I'm asked for an .iso file, but I cannot find it. What's wrong?\n\nA: Copying the iso directly to your usb drive will not work. You need to use a special program to make the usb drive bootable and then copy the files over. Take a look at this site. You'll find both programs and tutorials.\n\nA: When you download Ubuntu, it should come as an .iso file. When it is finished downloading (during download, it will be a \".crdownload\" file for Google Chrome and \".part\" or something similar for Firefox), you must use an application to burn it to your USB drive. Ubuntu comes with one such application called \"Startup Disk Creator.\" If you are using Windows, you can download Lili from http://www.linuxliveusb.com/ , I find it nice to use. In either of these applications, you select the .iso of Ubuntu you downloaded, your USB drive, and let it do the rest!\nI hope this helped!\n\nA: Follow these steps from the official Ubuntu site.\n", "Q: How can I disable the lock screen away message in Cinnamon?

Kind of. When I view a video of any kind, irrelevant of quality, I get awfully choppy, pixelated video. I'm aware this is definitely more graphics issues and I'm edging closer to the final straw.\nMy question is not only can someone help me to fix these issues, but I'd like to know if there's a more recommended graphics card out there that won't have any problems. Are ATI cards less susceptible to these kind of problems? Am I best sacrificing performance and just running the onboard Intel?\nI'm running a Packard Bell iXtreme with the following specs:\n\n\n*\n\n*Memory: 4GB\n\n*Processor: i3-2100 @ 3.10 Ghz x4\n\n*Graphics: GeForce GT 610/PCIe/SSE2 (with onboard Intel HD3000 that is disabled and 310 driver with xorg edgers.\n\n*Ubuntu 13.04 64-bit\n\n\nA: Can you check your compiz-config and your nvidia-settings if you have V-Sync enabled?\nI am running the 310 driver for ubuntu, but not with compiz. As I do not think it's performance with vsync is good enough. At work I am using a intel card with compiz, and it's a whole other deal, - works fluently. In my experience mutter or kwin does a better job with the vsync'ing in nvidia cards. Maybe someone else has a different experience, but I have had this problem both with my old 8800GT card and my current GTX 570.\nThere is a newer driver on the nvidia site 319.something. that you can try. But you will have to do a manual install.\n", "Q: grep \"+\" operator does not work This\nls -l /var/log | awk '{print $9}' | grep \"^[a-z]*\\.log.\"\n\noutputs this:\nalternatives.log.1\nalternatives.log.10.gz\nalternatives.log.2.gz\nalternatives.log.3.gz\nalternatives.log.4.gz\nalternatives.log.5.gz\nalternatives.log.6.gz\nalternatives.log.7.gz\nalternatives.log.8.gz\nalternatives.log.9.gz\napport.log.1\napport.log.2.gz\napport.log.3.gz\n\nbut this:\nls -l /var/log | awk '{print $9}' | grep \"^[a-z]+\\.log.\"\n\noutputs nothing. \nWhy? I just changed * to +. Isn't it similar? Operator + just needs at least one match, and * zero or more.\n\nA: This is because grep (without any arguments) only works with standard regular expressions. + is part of the extended regular expressions, so to use that, you need to use grep -E or egrep:\nls -l /var/log | awk '{print $9}' | grep -E \"^[a-z]+\\.log.\"\n\nAlso, you can just do this if you don't want to use extended regular expressions:\nls -l /var/log | awk '{print $9}' | grep \"^[a-z][a-z]*\\.log.\"\n\n\nA: To elaborate on MiJyns answer, \"special characters\" like + do work in standard regex as well, but you need to escape them with a backslash. You might say, the default expectations are reversed between standard and extended regex:\nIn standard regex, characters match literally by default. For example, in grep \"ab+\" the + is a literal +. The regex would for example find \"ab+ab\", but not \"abbbb\". To use the \"special meaning\" of +, you need to escape it. So grep \"ab\\+\" would find \"abbb\", but not \"ab+ab\" any longer. Because in the last example, the + is interpreted as the quantifier \"one or many of that\", in that case \"one or many b\". \nIn extended regex it's exactly the other way around. Here, you need to escape \"special characters\" to be treated literally. So grep -E \"ab+\" finds \"abbb\", but not \"ab+ab\". If you escape the +, it get's matched literally. So grep -E \"ab\\+\" finds \"ab+ab\", but not \"abbb\".\n", "Q: Rdio Quicklists I would like to have \"Play/Pause\" \"Next\" and \"Previous\" buttons in the quicklist for my Rdio.desktop \"web app.\" \nDetailed Explanation\nThe web app can be created either from Chrome (by going to menu > tools > create application shortcuts) or through Unity's web app interface.  Either of these methods puts a .desktop file in /home/user/.local/share/applications/ which opens a new browser window. \nIn case you use chrome, the result is:\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open                                                         \n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nName=Rdio\nExec=/opt/google/chrome/google-chrome --app=http://www.rdio.com/\nTerminal=false\nIcon=/home/user/icons/rdio.png\nType=Application\nCategories=Network;WebBrowser;\nStartupWMClass=www.rdio.com\n\nIn the case you use Unity's web app feature, the result is:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Rdio\nType=Application\nIcon=Rdio-www.rdio.com\nMimeType=\nActions=S0;S1;S2;S3;S4;S5;S6;S7;S8;S9;S10;\nExec=unity-webapps-runner -n 'UmRpbwA=' -d 'www.rdio.com' %u\n\nI want to add something like the following to either .desktop file (preferably the chrome one because Unity web apps don't work correctly) so that I can control playback with a right click:\nX-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts=PlayPause;Next;Previous;\n\n[PlayPause Shortcut Group]\nName=PlayPause\nExec=google-chrome (some arguments here?) rdio.com/?magic_url=play_pause\nTargetEnvironment=Unity\n\n#...

I am fairly good at the technical side of things, so don't be afraid to do your worst!\n\nA: The Sony Cybershot looks like it operates in MTP mode by default. To fix this easily, try changing the settings in your camera to operate as a \"Mass Storage Device\" instead.\nAs per this article, choose Menu, Settings, Main Settings, USB Connect, then choose Mass Storage.\nAlternatively you can try to get MTP working in Ubuntu, which is a little trickier.\nThis article worked for me and my Nexus 7 which only really works with MTP. Basically, do \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:langdalepl/gvfs-mtp\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\nThen try plugging in your Cybershot (make sure you change the camera settings back to MTP if you tried my first suggestion).\n\nA: Tried to connect my Sony Alpha 5000, but it dosn't workd.

In order to get back I need to Alt+Tab. Is there a way to fix this (Ubuntu 13.04 the best release ever)\n\nA: I think this is a bug. It only happens (at least, for me) when Nautilus is viewing files on a separate drive (like an external drive, or a memory card).\nThere is a workaround until this is fixed though. All you have to do is simply hover your mouse over the \"Files\" icon in launcher, and scroll up or down. If you have more than one window open, it will scroll between them. This, I find, is a lot faster than using Alt+Tab.\n\nA: This is a bug that has been around for a long time. But if you Unlock \"Files\" from the launcher, it seems to work just fine.\n@aikikode, Scrolling to focus seems to be removed in the 14.04 Beta-1. It is said that it is not in the design, so they removed it. But another bug suggests they should add it as an option and they probably will in the final release.\n\nA: Could you be more specific: how do you minimize and restore it?

Am I using the wrong .iso, or is the disk of the wrong format?\n\nA: OS X does weird stuff. Try again using the dd method and write the image to /dev/disk1 (not a partition). Make sure you get your devices right. Also make sure (via Disk Manager) that the disk (and partitions) are not mounted. Finder trys to auto-mount and borks things.\nAlso Macs are very cranky about what USB media they will boot from. Make sure your using a USB device that you know the mac can boot in the first place.

Is it possible to have an arbitrary amount of text placed next to the cursor on the command-line? I have heard that it is possible using Bash, but I am not sure how to accomplish it. It seems to be possible with readline, but the syntax of the shortcut seems to be rather obscure, as when I place it in my ~/.inputrc and use the shortcut, nothing appears in the terminal. Can anyone explain the correct syntax of the entries in ~/.inputrc?\n\nA: When on the command-line it is certainly possible to do what you want, although the syntax of readline can be confusing: see the appendix at the end of the article for a short list of examples.\nYou can use the GNU readline library and create some macros and place them in your ~/.inputrc. Then you will be able to insert arbitrary strings into the terminal when you press a key combination. As noted in the bash manual :\n\nIn addition to command names, readline allows keys to be bound to a string that is inserted when the key is pressed (a macro).\n  The  syntax  for  controlling  key bindings in the inputrc file is simple.  All that is required is the name of the command or the text of a macro and a key sequence to which it should be bound. The name may be specified in one of two ways: as a symbolic key name, possibly with Meta- or Control- prefixes, or as a key sequence.\n\nBe careful when assigning shortcut combinations to arbitrary strings, as many keybindings are already set whether you are using Bash's emacs or vi mode (in addition to the independent tty bindings). See bind -P for a list of currently bound Bash shortcuts, and stty -a for the others in use.\nYou just need to place your macros in ~/.inputrc (create it if it doesn't exist), and add, for example:\nControl-o: \"U+16a1\" \n\nbut it's probably better to use, for example, Ctrl+Alt+Oinstead, because most ctrl and a single letter combinations are already bound:\n\"\\e\\C-o\": \"U+16a1\"\n\nThen restart terminal and use your key combinations to place the string at the cursor's position. There are many complex and more interesting possibilities; experiment and you'll find the macros very useful when you have to repeat various things a lot. List your currently assigned macros with bind -s.\n\nList of examples for reference (don't use these as some will already be assigned): see bind -P:\n\"\\e\\C-k\": \"string\"  # ctrl+alt+k\n\"\\ey\": \"string\" # alt+y\n\"\\C-w\": \"string\" # ctrl+w\n\"\\C-x\\C-e\": \"string\" # ctrl+x, ctrl+e\n\nSee man 3 readline for more information and the Ubuntu manpages online.\n", "Q: How to set quickly to use python3 when creating new applications in Ubuntu 12.04 I'm just starting to learn python and use the standard set of tools in ubuntu 12.04 (quickly, glade, gedit). \nWhen I do quickly create ubuntu-application foo the application uses python 2.7 by default. \nI would rather use python3 since it's the version I'm learning and the plan is to drop python2 by 14.04.\nHow do I configure quickly to use python3 when creating new applications?

I tried manually downloading all the packages and running sudo dpkg -i but I get lots of errors about dependencies, some of which don't look like they can be resolved. Am I stuck with having to compile vim myself?  \n\nA: To avoid manual change of the sources list you can use the following command to add the repository for a specific Ubuntu version:\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/eudoxos/vim-breakindent/ubuntu <needed_version_here> main\"\nTo remove the added repo:\nsudo add-apt-repository -r \"deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/eudoxos/vim-breakindent/ubuntu <needed_version_here> main\"\n\nA: You should choose Modify in Software & Updates > Other software from raring to quantal distribution. \n\n\nA: After you add the repository, you can try to change the distribution manually:\n$ cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/eudoxos-vim-breakindent-<version>.list \ndeb http://ppa.launchpad.net/eudoxos/vim-breakindent/ubuntu <version> main\ndeb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/eudoxos/vim-breakindent/ubuntu <version> main\n\nSo just replace <version> on those entries with quantal, and do sudo apt-get update. It is not guaranteed it will work, but if it doesn't you can revert the canges or remove the PPA.\n", "Q: Is this Ram usage normal? My system is Ubuntu 13.04 64 bit + Unity and it uses ~600mb with no other processes-apps open and with preload 900mb, just the core system. Is this the expected amount? It seems a bit steep to me but perhaps this is normal behavior.\nps: my pc has 16gb ram\n\nA: The operating system makes buffers of as much memory as it can find. To find out how much actual memory is used try this script https://github.com/vaslabs/pi-web-agent/blob/master/usr/libexec/pi-web-agent/scripts/memory_information, it removes cache+bufferes from usage calculations\n", "Q: Can't run x-executable through gui/shell I'm pretty new to Ubuntu and Linux in general and today I was trying to get g++ to work.\nI compiled:\n#include <iostream>\nint main(void) {\n    std::cout << \"Hello World\" << std::endl;\n    char c;\n    std::cin >> c;\n    return 0;\n}\n\nand then I compiled it with g++ main.cpp -o main and it compiled correctly. The problem is when trying to run it from the shell (GUI), it just won't run. Running it from the Terminal works (with ./main).\nI'm not sure what I'm doing wrong here.\n\nA: You've written a terminal program, not a GUI program, there's no graphical interface loaded at all by your program.  So it \"not running\" from the GUI doesn't mean it isn't actually running.\nIf you run it form the GUI, you need to run it as \"Run from Terminal\".  Otherwise it won't show any output ever.\nHowever, you should probably instead be running from the terminal, navigating to the directory you saved the output in (the main file), then run it as you did.\n", "Q: Sony Vaio (SVE15129CAB) Built in SD Card Reader (RTS5116) Realtek NOT Working Ubuntu 12.04 Card Reader was working fine when I was using live USB, but after installation and upgrading it is not even detecting.

Hey I am trying to create startup and log-off sounds for Ubuntu 13.04. I have two mp3 files. I have sox and was wondering if I could create a .sh file (make it executable) and make it point to play a set .mp3. What I'm trying to do here is basically set up my Linux Box to be a mock up of HAL9000. With \"Good morning Dave\" and \"Daisy... Daisy...\" when it logs off. Any help would be appreciated. \n\nA: If You just want to have Your .mp3 played after logging in the easiest way is probably to put line like this to You 'Startup Applications' (you can find it in Bash).\nmplayer <exact address to Your file - for example: /home/tom/Music/Good.mp3>\n\nBut before that You will need to have mplayer installed. To do so type this in the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install mplayer\n\n. If You would like to have few .mp3 files played one after another You will probably need to create .sh file with lines similar to this presented before, make it executable and put exact path to this .sh file to 'Sturtup Applications'.\nMore info about mplayer here: http://docs.slackware.com/howtos:software:mplayer .\n\nI've noticed that with MPlayer You can easily use playlists. To do that just create text file and in every new line paste a path to Your .mp3 file. Example below - let's say it's /home/tom/Music/StartupPlaylist.txt.\n/home/tom/Music/Good.mp3\n/home/tom/Music/EpicMusic/Just Another Epic Track.mp3\n/home/tom/Desktop/Sounds of Desktop.mp3\n\nAfter doing that Your one-line-script should look similar to this below.\nmplayer -playlist <exact path to Your playlist file - for example: /home/tom/Music/StartupPlaylist.txt>\n\n", "Q: General Install Procedure I'm a new and interested user.  I have an older inspiron mini with windows 7 that doesn't have enough RAM to do anything so I thought I would give Ubuntu a try.  I was able to download the image file and place it on the flash drive.  I also modified the BIOS and got it to boot from the USB.  Now I am in Grub4DOS and have no idea what to do next.  I think I am missing a big part.  Please help!\n\nA: As you have an \"older Inspiron\" I would recommend using the wubi installer. I used it myself and it worked just fine. \nwubi installer: --> Wubi\nAnd if you decide to continue your installation here's the guide: Ubuntu Installation\n", "Q: Did I just delete everything with find -exec mv? I tried to figure this out on my own. Here's the command I used in the terminal:\nfind . -name \"*.jpg\" -exec mv {} pictures \\;\n\nI did not create a directory named pictures first. What happened was a file named pictures.gif was created. Did it find the files then overwrite them as it moved them? \nWhat is this pictures.gif file that has been created as a result of this command?\nAre the files still possibly on the drive somewhere? \n\nA: First: stop using this drive now. It's ok to remount it read-only, just make sure not to do any more writing. Yes, you've deleted the pictures. They may be recoverable, but the more you keep using that drive, the less chance you have to recover anything.\nYour command ran mv pic1.jpg pictures, mv pic2.jpg pictures, etc. Each invocation of mv overwrote the file currently named pictures by another picture.\nMoving a file (within the same filesystem) means detaching it from the directory that contains it and attaching it to the target directory under the new name. So no file data was modified or deleted by this command, only the directory entries for the images that have disappeared. \nYou can run a tool that scours your filesystem's free space and looks for things that look like jpegs. Fortunately, every jpeg file starts with a recognizable header. Tools that look for deleted content are called carving tools. There are a few in Ubuntu, including recoverjpeg, foremost, testdisk, … If the photos are on a separate home partition or on an external drive, install one or more of those packages and point them to the partition with the deleted pictures.\nIf the photos are on your system disk, you need to stop using your system immediately. Use another computer to download a live CD or USB and boot from that. Any of the live CDs that include testdisk should fit the bill, but some are easier to use than others. System Rescue CD is a good general-purpose system rescue CD. Ubuntu Rescue Remix may be more familiar for an Ubuntu user.\n\nFor future reference, get into the habit of using mv -i unless you aim to overwrite files. You may already have an alias for mv, but that only kicks in when you type mv directly on the command line, not when mv is invoked by a script or by the find command.\n$ : >pictures\n$ mv -i foo.jpg pictures\nmv: overwrite `pictures'?\n\nAlso, if you put a / after a name that is supposed to be the name of a directory, you'll get an error if the directory doesn't exist, or if there is a file by that name which isn't a directory.\n$ : >pictures\n$ mv foo.jpg pictures/\nmv: cannot move `foo.jpg' to `pictures/': Not a directory\n$ rm pictures\n$ mv foo.jpg pictures/\nmv: cannot move `foo.jpg' to `pictures/': Not a directory\n\nTo avoid the pitfalls of find, you could use bash's recursive directory traversal feature instead. You need to turn it on first with the command shopt -s globstar (you can add this line to your ~/.bashrc. Then:\nmv **/*.jpg pictures/\n\n(Note that in bash, **/ also traverses symbolic links to directories, and there's no way to turn this off. If you want a recursive traversal that doesn't look through symbolic links to directories, use zsh or find.)\n\nA: I am afraid that you have just lost all your pictures into that single file. It is possible to recover some files using forensic tools like foremost, but the success rate drops the longer you use the media (disk). (to be precise, the longer the partition is mounted.)\nNext time, when you mean a directory, add a slash to it and add the -i option to ask for confirmation in case a file already exists:\nfind -name \"*.jpg\" -exec mv -i {} pictures/ {} \\;\n\n", "Q: Chaining apt commands I've noticed that the majority of Ubuntu help websites present apt commands in the following format:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:[ppa-address]\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install [application-name]\n\nBut I know that apt commands like this one work too:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:[ppa-address] && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install [application-name]\n\nIs there a particular reason that most sites present in the first format? Are there known issues with chaining commands with &&, or to put it another way are there any benefits/drawbacks to using either method?\nFurther, other then loss of internet, are there any circumstances in which an apt command might fail?\n\nA: Personally, I think sites list them one by one just for clarity. It's easier to run one at a time and understand what it does then it is to run, say 3, all at once.  \nI might point out too, not all sites do list commands one by one. For example, in the OMG Ubuntu article on installing Unity Tweak Tool the commands are listed as:  \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:freyja-dev/unity-tweak-tool-daily  \nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool  \n\nIt's also worth noting that && will only run the second or third (etc) command if the command before it returns exit status 0. In other words, the command after &&  will only be run if the command before && completes successfully.  \nIf you'd like your string of commands to execute one by one no matter if any fail you would separate each command with ; instead of &&. For example:  \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:[ppa-address] ; sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get install [application-name]  \n\n(Of course, this wouldn't be a good thing to do when installing packages!)\nThere are a number of reasons why an apt command would fail:  \n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get install could fail for quite a few reasons, among them dependency issues, not enough disk space, no internet connection, or an old or malformed sources.list file.  \n\n*apt-get update could fail for similar reasons, a malformed sources.list, no internet connection, a 404 PPA, etc. \nThese are just some of the things that would cause apt to fail, causing commands after && to not be run.\n\nA: It's presented in the first form because it's easier to read.\nPlus, if you need to review your history for one of the commands, it's easier than picking one part of a long, complex command.\n", "Q: Ubuntu gets freezed, and it is slow First of all, sorry about my english.\nI installed ubuntu like, 5 months ago, but now my ubuntu gets freezed and stuck, it waits too way long to load an application,  I had to run another OS to do somenthing that I could perfectly do in Ubuntu. Do you guys know, how to \"clean\" my ubuntu? I mean, to make it faster? like it used to be at the beginning\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: I don't think there's a way to \"clean\" your Ubuntu by simply running a command or program, but here are some things you can do that might help:\n1) Uninstall packages that you don't need anymore, especially if they run as services.  You can list packages that are installed by typing dpkg --get-selections at a terminal.  Then uninstall those which you don't need anymore by typing sudo apt-get remove --purge [package_to_remove].\n2) Look for programs that are sucking up CPU and RAM.  There are many different ways to do this.  I prefer to type top at a terminal.  Consider replacing/removing any programs that are resource hungry.\n3) Switch to a lighter DE such as LXDE.  You can install this by typing sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop\n\nA: You could try running sudo apt-get clean or sudo apt-get autoclean. You could also try upgrading if you are a couple versions behind. I'd probably do a fresh install, otherwise you can use sudo apt-get update && sudo do-release-upgrade.\nSee this askubuntu question.\nThis has a guide for a 'safe' upgrade that might be better.\n\nA: Check the CPU cooling and graphics card cooling. Most of the times lots of dust and lint get into the cooling fins and fans raising the temperature, hence the low system performance.\n", "Q: Problem with speech dispatcher I had some problems with shutdown/restarting Ubuntu 13.04. It used to hang in a black screen with some codes about speech dispatcher. I searched the web and found a solution:\nsudo nano /etc/default/speech-dispatcher\n\nInside the file I changed the RUN property to yes, so the file started looking like this:\n# Defaults for the speech-dispatcher initscript, from speech-dispatcher\n\n# Set to yes to start system wide Speech Dispatcher\nRUN=yes\n\nI did so, the problem was solved but it disabled my internal speaker and mic. It looks like I have to choose between proper shutdowns and working mic/speaker.\nIs there any solution to have them both working?\nHardware: DELL Inspiron n5110\nDistro: Ubuntu 13.04 64bit\n\nA: Unless you need speech-dispatcher, you can just disable it. I installed Boot-up-manager:\nsudo apt-get install bum\n\n..and then I disabled speech-dispatcher:\n\n\nA: You don't need to uninstall/remove the speech-dispatcher to achieve a proper shutdown. Just remove it from automatic start/stop at the time of system boot/shutdown.\nUse the command: \nsudo update-rc.d -f speech-dispatcher remove\n\n\nA: I had an issue with rebooting and would get errors about speech dispatcher and using BUM and disabling it worked but I don't think my built in mic works. I'm on a HP tc4200 with ubuntu 12.04 and loving it.\n\nA: Open file /etc/default/speech-dispatcher on your favorite editor with sudo. \nExample: sudo nano /etc/default/speech-dispatcher\nChage:\nRUN=yes\n\nTo: \nRUN=no\n\nRestart and you are ready.\n", "Q: Two NIC's - one for Internet, the other for LAN I'm running Ubuntu 13.04 32bit.

I have bee months trying to revive a PC that is so old, people that I told about it just say to junk it. But I believe that there is a Linux OS out there that can help me out. \nThe Type of PC that I'm trying to Revive is a 2001 Gateway Desktop with an Intel Pentium 4 processor. The Processing speed is 1.50Gz, and the System Bus Speed is 400MHz. The Cache RAM is 256KB and the total Memory with a friend's Driver that I installed on it is 512MB but 256MB with the one it came with. It also runs on Windows xp but the OS is messed up.

Ubuntu or any OS Linux can I install on my computer? \n\nA: You can try Xubuntu - is perfect for those who want the most out of their desktops, laptops and netbooks with a modern look and enough features for efficient, daily usage. It works well on older hardware.\n\nOr, better, Lubuntu -  is targeted at PC and laptop users running on low-spec hardware that, in most cases, just don't have enough resources for all the bells and whistles of the \"full-featured\" mainstream distributions. \n\n\nA: You can try Lubuntu, which is simmialr to Xubuntu, but uses LXDE instead.\n\nA: I'd say replace the hard drive with a small SSD, and then run any flavor of Ubuntu you like.  1 GB of RAM and 1.5 GHz is MIGHTY thin, but the bottleneck of any general purpose computer is the hard drive.  Any *buntu offering over 10.x will be a little laggy, but not overly so.

I will appreciate if someone could introduce me to LXC and tell me how to get started with this technology?

By making use of existing functionality like the Linux kernel's new resource management and resource isolation features (Cgroups and name spaces), these processes can have their own private view of the operating system with its own process ID (PID) space, file system structure and network interfaces.\nContainers share the same kernel with anything else that is running on it, but can be constrained to only use a defined amount of resources such as CPU, memory or I/O. By combining containers with other features like the Btrfs file system , it will be possible to quickly set up multiple lightweight isolated Linux instances on a single host. Therefore containers are better compared to Solaris zones or BSD jails. \n\n\nInstallation\n\nMaking LXC easier\nOne of the main focus for Ubuntu LTS was to make LXC dead easy to use, to achieve this.\nCreating a basic container and starting it on Ubuntu\n sudo apt-get install lxc\n sudo lxc-create -t ubuntu -n my-container\n sudo lxc-start -n my-container\n\nLog In\nsudo lxc-console -n my-container -t 1\n\nThis will default to using the same version and architecture as your machine, additional option are obviously available (–help will list them). Login/Password are ubuntu/ubuntu.\nFor Detail Host Configuration\n\n\nFor More About LXC\n\nDebian \nOracle \nsourceforge\n\nLXC Web Panel\n\nFor Newbie I would recommend to use LXC Webpanel, The good part is that if you make a container through cli mode, It will show up in LXC Web Panel\n\n  sudo apt-get install lxc debootstrap bridge-utils -y\n  sudo su\n  wget https://lxc-webpanel.github.com/tools/install.sh -O - | bash\n\nOpen Web Browser and Connect\n                       http://your_ip_address:5000/\n                Login with user admin and password admin\n\nOverview\n\n\nContainers Overview\n\n\n\nLXC Network\n\n\n\nContainer Settings\n\n\nResource Limitation \n\n\nUser Modification ( Create, Delete Modify )\n\n\n\n\nA: I think a better question is what do you want to do with LXC?\nI would start with the community documentation and ask specific questions about specific things you do not understand.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/lxc.html\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/LXC\nLXC can be used to isolate services or other processes from the host although the isolation is not always perfect.\nLXC is, IMO, in rapid development and it may help if you subscribe to the mailing list.\nhttp://lxc.sourceforge.net/index.php/about/lxc-development/\nDistrowatch also did a nice overview last week\nhttp://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20130429#qa\n\nA: LXC\nLXC which is an abbreviated way of saying LinuX Containers is an operating system-level virtualization method for running multiple isolated Linux systems which are called containers on a single control host. Since LXC provides operating system-level virtualization, it is not via a full blown virtual machine, but rather it provides it's own virtual environment that has its own process and network space. \nLXC relies on the Linux kernel cgroups (Control Groups) which is developed as part of LXC which is a feature to limit, account and isolate resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, etc.) of process groups. It also relies on other kinds of namespace-isolation functionality, which were developed and integrated into the mainline Linux kernel.\nIn Ubuntu you can find tools like Juju that are used with LXC. You can even find several tutorials:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I configure juju for local usage?\n\n*How do I run Juju on a local server?\n\n*Can I use juju with LXC in a non-local configuration?\nTo use LXC and it's benefits I recommend reading the Ubuntu Guide for Juju \nOfficial Site -  https://linuxcontainers.org/\nMailing lists are hosted here\n", "Q: Bluetooth discoverability Hi my bluetooth is present in hardware and I can turn it on in settings\nbut for some reason it is not enabled and I cannot turn on visability (discoverability).How can I fix this in a dell inspiron mini?

Does alien -i do it for me?\nPS googled for an answer -- not that lucky today, man alien doesn't say much on -i.\n\nA: IMO you should be very careful with alien as the packaging of say .rpm and .deb are very different. Alien can sometimes convert packages, but sometimes there can be significant problems and sometimes say Fedora libs conflict with Debian / Ubuntu libs. Also your converted package can overwrite system files without warning (obviously as it is installing packages). Last, pre/post install scripting is somewhat different from .rpm and .deb and Alien can not always convert the scripts.\nIMO you are much better off either installing from source code using checkinstall\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckInstall\nAlthough occasionally checkinstall can have similar issues.\nPersonally I read the README and usually just compile form source into /usr/local\n./configure --prefix=/usr/local\nmake\nsudo make install\n\n", "Q: How do I get Windows XP to display a boot menu at all?

How to see in the terminal that you have sudo privileges? (so knowing I have these privileges, I can just type sudo -k) It would be better to not add too much information into the terminal also, just some kind of simple and small alert!\nREMAINING TIME IS IMPOSSIBLE, right? \nAlso, how to see how much time I still have with those privileges on that specific terminal? (so I can just let it end instead of typing sudo -k). I think that remaining time could show up each time I press Enter key. \nEDIT: I researched more and found that /var/lib/sudo/$USER/$nPts (where $nPts is current terminal pts as of ps -p $$) has its timestamp updated everytime a sudo command is issued, and it is only accessible if you use a sudo command, so the remaining time will always be the configured one...\nPS.: Alternatively to that, I tried alias sudo='sudo -k' but I dislike having to type the password for every command... And also, this alias sudos='sudo -k' (or alias ssudo='sudo -k', good if you typed a long line, just press Home and type 's') works if you only want to issue one command by typing sudos. But I still miss to know when I have normal sudo privileges to know I need to act...\n\nA: [I still would like to know if there is a better answear.]\nI found a way that works, and the prompt will be kept on a single line:\nat the end of your ~/.bashrc add this:\nfunction FUNCsudoOn() { \n    if sudo -n uptime 2>/dev/null 1>/dev/null; then \n        echo -ne \"\\E[0m\\E[93m\\E[41m\\E[1m\\E[5m SUDO \\E[0m\"; \n        #echo #without newline, the terminal seems to bugout with lines that are too big... discomment this if you find any problems...\n    fi; \n}\nfunction FUNCpromptCommand () { \n    FUNCsudoOn\n}\nexport PROMPT_COMMAND=FUNCpromptCommand\n#export PS1=\"\\`FUNCsudoOn\\`$PS1\" #this also works, use instead of PROMPT_COMMAND\n\nEDIT: I found that sudo -n uptime will update the sudo timeout, so everytime you hit the Enter key, that sudo time will be updated... That makes knowing the remaining time useless, as it will always be the configured one, defaulting to 15min...\nand to find the best colors formatting for you taste you can use ScriptEchoColor with --escapedchars option like:\nechoc --escapedchars \"@{nRlyo} SUDO \" #that outputs below...\necho -e \"\\E[0m\\E[93m\\E[41m\\E[1m\\E[5m SUDO \\E[0m\"\n\nto just stop the blinking remove \\E[5m like in \\E[0m\\E[93m\\E[41m\\E[1m SUDO \\E[0m\n\nA: Your terminal doesn't \"have sudo privileges\", unless you do something silly like sudo bash DON'T DO THIS!\nAll you have to do to \"have normal sudo privileges\" is to refrain from typing sudo in front of the command.\n/usr/bin/id is a good way to see what sudo does. For example:\nid -a        # returns my UID info\nsudo id -a   # returns root's info\nid -a        # me again\nsudo id -a   # root again\n\nThe sudo man page says \"The sudoers policy caches credentials for 15 minutes, unless overridden in sudoers(5)\". What this means is that, by default, if you issue a sudo command (and enter your password),then wait 14.9 minutes before issuing a second sudo command, you won't have to enter your password again. If you wait 15.1 minutes, you will have to re-enter the password. sudo -k simply expires the 15 minute timer immediately. The only use I can see for sudo -k is if you're about to yield your unlocked terminal to someone you don't trust with UID 0.\n", "Q: How should I partition my new SSD? (Journaling on another HDD?)

I have a fairly old laptop that has no other use which is why I ask. \nSo is there any way of doing this?  Like streaming the audio and video for that user out to the laptop, and the input events from the laptop's keyboard in?  The laptop and desktop would be linked with ethernet not wireless so there would definitely be the bandwidth.  It might just be a dream, but it would be really cool.  Thanks for any answers!\nThe Solution:\nI got it working! Using Freedom-Ben's post I setup everything in those two links to get x11 forwarding with audio working.  The one problem you will have is that when you are using a really old laptop as the client, any OpenGL applications wont work very well.  This is because it forwards all the opengl calls to the client.  I found an amazing thing called virtualgl, which renders everything on my desktop, and sends only the frames to the client.  If you are interested in this, visit this post: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=134207 .  It works great when on a local machine, very little bandwidth needed.\n\nA: Dude that is an awesome idea!  You should be able to accomplish this using SSH X forwarding.  The instructions for setting this up can be found on unix.stackexchange.  Using X forwarding you can SSH from the laptop into the desktop and run graphical programs over the wire.  To get the audio working, check out this question on SuperUser.  Good luck!

I removed Unity from my system (Ubuntu 13.04), however, there is a remaining file located in Thunderbird Extensions, which is \"Messaging Menu and Unity Launcher integration\". I searched for the file in Synaptic, but I didn't find it.\nMy question is: What is the name of the package?\n\nA: This extension is included in Thunderbird's package itself. You would need to run:\nsudo rm /usr/lib/thunderbird-addons/extensions/messagingmenu@mozilla.com.xpi\nThis will remove the extension's installer. When you do so it should (in theory) allow you to remove it from your Thunderbird profile.\n", "Q: need help with unison I finally converted my desktop machine from Windows Vista to Lubuntu 13.04. I am having trouble getting the unison file sync program (version 2.40.65) to work on the Lubuntu machine, despite trying very hard all afternoon googling through various forums.\nHere is the basic setup: Lubuntu desktop machine (DTM); Dlink Network accessed storage device (NAS), which is mounted on DTM as /mnt/nas (in fstab, cifs, defaults).\nUnison works going from NAS to DTM. However if a file is created or updated on DTM, unison fails to propagate over to NAS. It creates a new file .unison.newfile.XXXX.unison.tmp with the correct size in the NAS destination directory, but unable to rename it. The exact error message is\nFailed: error in digesting .unison.newfile.XXXX.unison.tmp\n.unison.newfile.XXXX.unison.tmp: permission denied.\nIf I run Unison under sudo, then changes from DTM do propagate over to the NAS. However, changes from the NAS side get copied to DTM as root, which causes endless trouble for m\nBy the way, on my old Windows Vista, I ran Unison under Cygwin without having any problem.\nYour answer is greatly appreciated. Thank you.\n\nA: I figured out the answer. it turns out to be not Unison related, but has every thing to do with how the NAS is mounted on the local Linux machine.\nIn /etc/fstab, I used\n//192.168.1.61/Volume_1 /mnt/nas cifs defaults   0   0\n\nNow I am mounting using\n//192.168.1.61/Volume_1 /mnt/nas cifs guest,rw,uid=1000,gid=1000,nounix,iocharset=utf8,file_mode=0644,dir_mode=0755 0 0\n\nUnison is working smoothly now. The key is that the mounted uid and gid should match the uid and gid on the local machine, which is NOT the case when using the defaults option.\nTherefore Unison was running into all kinds of permission related problems. \nI hope this is helpful to others encountering similar problems.\n\nA: There's an alternate solution that is probably worth sharing: If you call unison with -dontchmod it runs fine for me.\nNote that you cannot sync permissions as direct consequence, though, and need to additionally specify -perms 0, at least for my version of unison.\nFurthermore, your solution seems to fail for me if I specify the nounix flag. Could be due to my setup, though.

How can I get rid of it? It's quite distracting while coding in Guake mode and annoying while watching movies.\n\nIn the picture I've setup Guake with some transparency (that's why you can see things underneath), but the shadow is on the top of everything while I am in fullscreen. This, as I have already said, happens to me both while I am watching movies or programming in fullscreen mode.\nThis usually happens after awaking the laptop from hibernation. Now it looks like it has gone, but I am still wandering if someone knows something about it.\n\nAnd here back it is >:[\n\nI'm running Ubuntu 13.04\n\nA: It's rather workaround then solution, but what You can do is to remove this shadow completely. To do so type commend below - it generally only renames the file, doesn't remove it.\nsudo mv /usr/share/unity/6/panel-shadow.png /usr/share/unity/6/panel-shadow.png-removed\n\nAfter that restart Unity by typing unity in alt+f2 console or in Terminal.\nYou can also bring back this shadow again anytime. \nsudo mv /usr/share/unity/6/panel-shadow.png-removed /usr/share/unity/6/panel-shadow.png\n\nAnd if You really need that shadow sometimes You can just create two hotkeys with commends above or with && unity added to both of them.\nAnd You can also check this out: http://www.webupd8.org/2013/05/fix-shadow-displayed-on-top-of-full.html .\n\nA: Download Unity Tweak Tool and on the main window select Panel under Unity to show the available options for the panel.

It is a system virtualization application (based on the QEMU machine emulator) that is a core part of the GNOME desktop environment. It is a virtualization app that allows you to quickly create a virtual system without fiddling with too many options and choices. It is not a highly sophisticated solution like Virtualbox, or VMWare, but it may fits your needs if your requirements are not so complicated.\nInstallation: sudo apt install gnome-boxes\nFor details: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Boxes\nAnother alternative is Virtual Machine Manager app, that is a desktop user interface for managing virtual machines through libvirt (that primarily targets KVM VMs, but it is able to open the Gnome Boxes VM as well).\nVirtual Manager allows you to define the hardware properties of the VM through a graphical interface: the result of these settings is a description of the hardware in an XML format.\nInstallation: sudo apt install virt-manager\nFor details: https://virt-manager.org/\n", "Q: how to check network card bonding speed in ubuntu 10.04 I have Ubuntu 10.04  install DELL R710 server\nI have configured the network bonding using the below steps\nsudo apt-get install ifenslave\n-------------------------------------------\nvi /etc/network/interfaces\n# The loopback network interface\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n# The primary network interface\nauto eth0\n iface eth0 inet manual\n   bond-master bond0\n auto eth1\n iface eth1 inet manual\n   bond-master bond0\n auto bond0\n iface bond0 inet static\n   address 172.24.1.10\n   gateway 172.24.1.1\n   netmask 255.255.255.0\n   dns-nameservers 172.24.1.50\n   dns-search xxx.xxx\n   bond-mode balance-rr\n   bond-miimon 100\n   bond-lacp-rate 1\n   bond-slaves none\n----------------------------------------------------------\ncat /proc/net/bonding/bond0\nEthernet Channel Bonding Driver: v3.5.0 (November 4, 2008)\nBonding Mode: load balancing (round-robin)\nMII Status: up\nMII Polling Interval (ms): 100\nUp Delay (ms): 0\nDown Delay (ms): 0\nSlave Interface: eth0\nMII Status: up\nLink Failure Count: 0\nPermanent HW addr: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\nSlave Interface: eth1\nMII Status: up\nLink Failure Count: 0\nPermanent HW addr: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:yy\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n **its not showing the bonding speed .**\n---------------------------------------------------------\nethtool eth0\nSettings for eth0:\n        Supported ports: [ TP ]\n        Supported link modes:   10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full\n                                100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full\n                                1000baseT/Full\n        Supports auto-negotiation: Yes\n        Advertised link modes:  10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full\n                                100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full\n                                1000baseT/Full\n        Advertised pause frame use: No\n        Advertised auto-negotiation: Yes\n        Link partner advertised link modes:  Not reported\n        Link partner advertised pause frame use: No\n        Link partner advertised auto-negotiation: No\n        Speed: 1000Mb/s\n        Duplex: Full\n        Port: Twisted Pair\n        PHYAD: 1\n        Transceiver: internal\n        Auto-negotiation: on\n        MDI-X: Unknown\n        Supports Wake-on: g\n        Wake-on: g\n        Link detected: yes\n ethtool eth1\nSettings for eth1:\n        Supported ports: [ TP ]\n        Supported link modes:   10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full\n                                100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full\n                                1000baseT/Full\n        Supports auto-negotiation: Yes\n        Advertised link modes:  10baseT/Half 10baseT/Full\n                                100baseT/Half 100baseT/Full\n                                1000baseT/Full\n        Advertised pause frame use: No\n        Advertised auto-negotiation: Yes\n        Link partner advertised link modes:  Not reported\n        Link partner advertised pause frame use: No\n        Link partner advertised auto-negotiation: No\n        Speed: 1000Mb/s\n        Duplex: Full\n        Port: Twisted Pair\n        PHYAD: 1\n        Transceiver: internal\n        Auto-negotiation: on\n        MDI-X: Unknown\n        Supports Wake-on: g\n        Wake-on: g\n        Link detected: yes\n\nboth network card speed is 1000MBPS.
