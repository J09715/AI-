Ubuntu noob here. How do I open a file in a working directory? I have already tried\n./MyFile.jpg\n\nAnd it replies with \nbash: ./MyFile.jpg: Permission denied\n\nNow, that got me thinking that I had to go and change the permissions. So I used chmod to make the file permission \"rwx\" (I'm not sure if making executable permissible is going to do what I want, it just seemed logical) and tried\n./MyFile.jpg\n\nBut this returned\nbash: ./MyFile.jpg: cannot execute binary file\n\nWhich makes me think the chmod was not the right way to go. So I changed the permission back so that it was not \"rwx\", but just \"rw-\".\nNow I'm stuck feeling pretty foolish because I can't open a simple file in Terminal. I can open it by not using Terminal and double clicking on the file while on the Desktop, but I want to teach myself how to navigate using the Terminal. I also tried\nsudo ./MyFile.jpg\n\nbut that didn't work either. Any help?\n\nA: If you want to use the default program for opening a file you can use \ngnome-open YourFile\n\nor (as Florian Diesch mentioned in a comment) you can use the following command which also works on every XDG-compliant desktop environment (including KDE, LXDE, and XFCE):\nxdg-open YourFile\n\nYou have to use a command to open a file. In your case you could use\neog MyFile.jpg\n\nNo need to mess with permissions. Eog is the eye of gnome. Type man eog for more information. It can open the following image files: ani, bmp, gif, ico, jpeg, pcx, png, pnm, ras, svg, tga, tiff, wbmp, xbm, and xpm.\nFor other file types you need other commands. For example:\n\n\n*\n\n*A pdf file called YourMajesty.pdf can be opened with evince YourMajesty.pdf. \n\n*A text file named MyFile.txt can be opened using gedit MyFile.txt and that also holds for many other files containing text (but not having a .txt extension). \n\n\nIf you add a  & at the end of your command (for instance, eog MyPhoto.jpg &) you can still continue using the same terminal for other commands.\n\nA: In the command line it is not possible to just mention a file and have automatically start the appropriate program with that file.\nSo you must invoke that program (in this case you can use \"Eye of Gnome\" hence eog).\nTry\neog Myfile.jpg\n\nYou can also get back the control of your terminal immediately if you tell eog to launch \"in the background\" by invoking it with eog Myfile.jpg &.\nAnother hint: use tab to let the terminal autocomplete your input.\n\nA: If you want to open a file, use gnome-open. Think of it as equivalent to double-clicking on the file in Nautilus.\ngnome-open MyFile.jpg\n\nIf you want to execute a script or a program, then make its execute permission is set, and type the filename prefixed with the path: (You would never do this with a JPG image, because it is not an executable program.)\n./executable-name\n\n", "Q: How do I fix the \"no such partition\" error from GRUB?

My question is:10) Does the file system suffer any performance penalties by using encryption?выбрал шифрованную файловую систем EXT4. Вопрос: производительность файловой системы страдает от шифрования? мои диски\n\nA: Well in the past, encrypting the system would have a strong performance hit since all the I/O and processing that needed to be done between encryption and reading/writing to the disk. But since a couple of versions ago, the performance hit is less than 5%. I would even be so bold as to say it is less than 1% since, with some tested I did, the video performance, copy/paste, hdd benchmark and speed of boot were almost the same.\nAnd since you are using Ubuntu 12.10, there is even less of a performance penalty.\nHere is a link of the Performance on Ubuntu 11.10 with and without Encryption\nAnd here is a very old benchmark on how it looked on 9.10\nAs you can see the performance has gone up since 11.10 and you are using 12.10, so the performance is basically the same.

I cannot install Ubuntu because it makes the claim that no drive space is available.

For such cases you need to use the alternate installer.\nThe alternate installer has some extra checks and will show you a list of drivers to select for your controller. So (obviously) to get the correct one you need to find out what type of controller you have. You might be able to find this information in your manuals, maybe in your BIOS or maybe from the live CD (lspci and/or dmesg | grep SATA). It might be useful to include hardware specs in your question (and someone might be able to tell from that what the controller might be).\nThe iSCSI part is probably shown due to selecting the wrong controller. It is a setup where you provide IP and port to get to the controller. The IP I am unsure of but al lot of examples I see state 192.168.1.10 with port 3260 (is the default). \n\nI found the following, that looks like your issue, on launchpad: https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+question/122781\nThere is a command there \ndmesg > ~/out123.txt; gedit ~/out123.txt; rm ~/out123.txt\n\nSearch for lines that state ata and look like errors.

Now I got a new (second hand) machine, a Dell Vostro 1500 and decided to just take the hard drive from the XPS and put it in the Vostro, rather than having to reinstall Ubuntu.\nAll appears to be working, except for the wireless driver. The previous owner of the Vostro went with the Broadcom, unfortunately.

However, directly below the option it says \"This device is not working\". I had assumed that was because I simply needed to install the proprietary drivers (still mostly think that). However after I try to enable it, I get a progress bar for installing it that stops part way through and then the \"Do not use the device\" option is reselected.\nI have the install media but have been unable to figure out how to get the system to extract the driver from it (assuming internet only install?).\nThe only thing I have not yet tried was purchasing a USB style connecter & attempting hook into ISP modem/router via USB based connection.

(This is just example)\nNext execute the command,\nsudo apt-get --print-uris --yes --reinstall install b43-fwcutter | grep ^\\' | cut -d\\' -f2 > b43-fwcutter.txt\n\nThis will produce the dependent links to the text file. Do this for all the packages required.\nNow pass the file in another computer using wget (you can pass a file to wget to download all links using wget --input-file filename.txt) or any other download manager(if in windows) to download the packages.\nOnce done, copy all the deb packages to your target computer. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory using cd, and use sudo dpkg -i *.deb \n\nA: Two options I see to go from here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the drivers on your installation using another machine.\nPut the hard drive in another machine (with network/internet) and run the steps towards your solution from there. Unlike Windows driver installations, you don't need hardware to install the support for it.\n\n*Find alternatives to get connected and be creative, e.g. using an USB wired network adapter or an alternative working WiFi adapter borrowed from a friend or neighbour.\nI suggest to buy one of these.

This is because in 12.10, many features found in the Linux kernel for the Intel core i3, i5, i7 and their respective video cards (HD 3000 and 4000) were added. So you will substantially see a huge benefit when you jump to 12.10. I know I did with my i7 and HD 3000.\nBasically there is much more support for all Intel Core 2nd and 3rd generations in 12.10. There is also more support for newer motherboards and devices in general.\nAlso, the performance of the Intel HD 3000 and 4000 is way better than in 12.04.\nI also read your BUG link and it started with many users having problem, but the more they moved to a newer version, the less people reported problems, and they even included several solutions to that specific bug.

On Ubuntu 10.04 I had installed the GNU Pascal Compiler (package gpc).\nAfter moving to Ubuntu 12.04 / 64 bit I cannot find the package any more. Google and the GNU Pascal homepage did not help much.\nSo I wanted to ask if the package has been discontinued, renamed, or moved to a different repository.\n\nA: It appears that gpc was removed from Debian (and subsequently Ubuntu) in February 2011 due to the project being unmaintained/discontinued. \n\nA: PPA versions of the GNU Pascal Compiler for Ubuntu can be downloaded from https://launchpad.net/~ueter/+archive/ubuntu/gpc-3.4\n\nA: Not exactly gpc, but if you don't mind an alternative, you could use Free Pascal.

(just so I can \"sudo\" a command that requires it - basically doing what needs to be done and then switching back to the standard user)\nMy question is: Is this a good security practice or does it make no sense at all to have it set up like this? From what I can tell so far I don't seem to need administrator privileges that often anyway.\nThe reason I'm asking is that I've only recently learned that there is a difference between the root account and my administrator account :). I'm still partially confused about it but from what I can gather you \"tap\" into the root account using something like \"sudo\" in the terminal while being logged in as a user that is in the sudoers (an administrator). The strangeness of it is that in order to \"sudo\" something I basically enter the same password my administrator account has. Doesn't this mean that if my administrator account is compromised then so is the root account? I'm all too terribly confused by this :(.\n\nA: I don't see anything wrong with your added layer of security.  By adding in the additional user, it keeps a false command from being executed under the normal user that would affect the entire system.  That was the point with a root login in the past.  Is it overkill, perhaps, but that's one of the great things with a GNU/Linux system.  It is your system to set as you like. \nRemember, asking questions is never wrong, as long as you ask the right question...\n\nA: I migrated to Ubuntu a similar time ago to you and the way I see it (although might be innacurate) neither of your accounts are permanently logged in as sudo or su. This is logical for the Standard User, but might seem less so for the Administrator User.\nIn both cases you need your Administrator password to run the super-user commands, the benefit however is that your commands launched by the Standard User won't affect the whole system, therefore if anything goes wrong you'll have no worries to sort it out using the Administrator account.\nI'm not very knowledgeable on the issue but I've found reading questions such as: Why is it bad to run as root helped me understand a bit better the difference between root and sudo I'd give the answers a read as they're quite informative. \n", "Q: 12.04 doesn't boot up after kernel update I updated from 3.2.0-35 to 3.4 and now it just boots to a black screen after the BIOS.

I have had it for a long time but now when I set up a new PC it was time to make it work. \n\n\n*\n\n*I set my Ubuntu box as a WINS server and also added the lines from the post above to my smb.conf:\nwins support = yes\nlocal master = yes\npreferred master = yes\n\n\n*Since that didn't help, I forced my Win7 box to use the Ubuntu box as WINS server by modifying the advanced WINS settings in the IPv4 preferences of the network adapter\n\n*That didn't help either so I fired up Wireshark to see what was happening. I saw the Win7 box query the WINS server and I saw the response containing all computers with shares. So, why didn't they show up in Windows? I thought Firewall. I use the Windows firewall and in the advanced settings for that I noticed that\nFile and Printer Sharing (LLMNR-UDP-In)\n\nis enabled for private networks but not for domain or public. I simply enabled the rule for domain and public as well.\n\n*Phew, my computers now show up in Windows. I suppose that there might be a way to make Win7 include the Ubuntu box and other linux machines in whatever it defines as private network but I will save that adventure for another day.\nI hope that this might help someone.\nEDIT: After enabling the firewall rule I removed the hard-coded WINS server setting in the network adapter, now when the traffic is allowed, I think that the standard negotiatioon process might work as I want it to.\n\nA: To share resources (File Sharing) between 2 or more computers on the same LAN you need Samba which by default comes with Network discovery (After having Samba installed) activated. It will work for your local network but you need to remember to set the workgroup to the one the network is using. \nTo install Samba, first you either have to \"Share a folder\", I recommend sharing anything inside your home folder so it is less trouble because of permissions, this can be a folder in your desktop for example. You can share it by right clicking the folder and selecting Sharing, Ubuntu will guide you through a couple of Sharing questions that involve installing Samba and setting the correct permissions.\nThe other way to install samba is by literally installing samba ;). Either with Software Center or in the terminal typing the following: sudo apt-get install samba <-- Didn't see that one coming did you!\nNow to edit the Samba configuration and make sure you are on the same network workgroup. The workgroup should be the same for all machines in your LAN. This way, they can actually take advantage of the network discovery between Windows and Ubuntu or Ubuntu and Ubuntu machines.\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit your smb.conf file: sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf\n\n*Find the line in the [Global] secion that reads workgroup\n[global]\n\n## Browsing/Identification ###\n\n# Change this to the workgroup/NT-domain name your Samba server will part of  \n workgroup = WORKGROUP\n\n\n*Change the value of workgroup to the one your network workgroup is using or set a new name for the workgroup you would like to be working on, for example:\nworkgroup = myhomenet\n\n\n*Save the file and restart the Samba service: sudo service smbd restart\nEnjoy the power of weird network discovery ^^\nThis should be enough to have an Ubuntu to Ubuntu LAN working but in cases where Windows is involved and just in case Windows does not see your Ubuntu PC, add the following to your [Global] section in your smb.conf file:\nlocal master = yes\npreferred master = yes\n\nAnd of course restart your Samba service.\nIf still it does not see it, in Windows look for the Advanced Sharing Settings found in the left panel in the Network and Sharing Center. While in there choose the option Enable file sharing for devices that use 40 or 56 bit encryption. This is only an issue in Windows Vista and Above, if you have Windows XP it should work correctly.\nAfter this, to access any other computers on the Network you can open the File Browser and select Browse Network :\n\n\nA: Well I have solved it by going to add remove windows components and checked SMB1 /CIFS client and server and it worked like a charm.\nI hope it helps you.\nRegards\nMarko\n\nA: Even though this is old question, it is still topic where Samba has some problems. \nI was putting up Samba server and it was working properly, except my Windows 10 were not able to see my Samba server in Network places (but I was able to access it via IP address directly). The problem is in Windows Service Discovery - which is not yet implemented in Samba. \nThere is however WSDD github repository which adds this functionality into your Samba server. It is written in Python with good documentation and also links to alternative projects, discussions why Samba is not working and also warns about using SMB1 protocol (which is still seen as a \"fix\" to this problem in some \ninstructions on the internet - because it uses NetBIOS which IS impemented in Samba). \n\nA: If you want something that is user friendly there is a tool called system-config-samba that you can get from the software manager.\nOnce you have this downloaded you can see which folders are shared, their permissions and if they are visible. At least one folder must be visible in order for a Windows machine to see it on the network.\n", "Q: Shell tab-completion for service command broken as root On most of our servers, tab completion of service names after typing in the service command no longer works, as root. It works just fine as non-root. This is on Ubuntu 12.04. I'm not sure how to approach troubleshooting this.\nDemonstrating:\nTab completion works as the normal user zachary, who pressed tab to list completions in the first image:\n\nBut as user root, it doesn't list services as completions (only files):\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. \n\nA: This is disabled by default on Ubuntu.\nRead your /root/.bashrc:\n# enable programmable completion features (you don't need to enable\n# this, if it's already enabled in /etc/bash.bashrc and /etc/profile\n# sources /etc/bash.bashrc).\n#if [ -f /etc/bash_completion ] && ! shopt -oq posix; then\n#    . /etc/bash_completion\n#fi\n\nBash completion is all commented out. Apparently there's a reason for it I'm not aware of (recovery single user mode perhaps?).\nThe reason for why it does work when you do sudo su, sudo -s, sudo bash is that it doesn't really run login to make you completely root. When running sudo su - or sudo -i it really does completely logs you in as that user. Here, by example of the environment variable $HOME, more of this difference:\ngert@gert-laptop:~$ id\nuid=1000(gert) gid=1000(gert) groups=1000(gert),4(adm),7(lp),24(cdrom),27(sudo),[...]\ngert@gert-laptop:~$ echo $HOME\n/home/gert\ngert@gert-laptop:~$ sudo -s\nroot@gert-laptop:~# id\nuid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)\nroot@gert-laptop:~# echo $HOME\n/home/gert\nroot@gert-laptop:~# exit\ngert@gert-laptop:~$ sudo su -\nroot@gert-laptop:~# id\nuid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)\nroot@gert-laptop:~# echo $HOME\n/root\n\n\nA: Ok so I've figured it out, sort of.\nThings that work:  \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo -i\n\n*sudo su -\n\n\n\nThings that don't work:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo -s\n\n*sudo su\n\n*sudo bash\n\n\nSo it appears to me that in the former case, you're actually creating a new login shell, so bashrc, profile, etc are loaded correctly, either from ~ or from /etc/skel. In the latter case you're just \"executing bash as root\" and not actually loading all those critical functions into the shell for autocomplete and the like.\nCaveat: My explanation might be 100% wrong. But the top group does work.\n\nA: You can do following steps to get completion for sudo in bash:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open your .bashrc.\n\n*Insert the following lines and save the file\nif [ \"$PS1\" ]; then\ncomplete -cf sudo\nfi\nThe complete command generates lists of completions for command names (-c) and files name (-f) for sudo. \n\n*Open a new bash and type sudo -sTab or any other command you want to use.\n\n\nA: I had the same problem with root not auto-completing. I unsuccessfully tried a couple other ways including messing around with the .bashrc and installing a couple packages. What finally worked for me was as simple as just running bash. So you do your sudo su and tab just lists (in /root)\nroot@xxxxxxxx:~# service<tab>\nroot@xxxxxxxx:~# service .<tab><tab>\n./             .aptitude/     .bashrc        .viminfo  \n../            .bash_history  .profile  \n\necho $SHELL replies /bin/bash so I'm running bash, but it's not working. Now I run bash and my shell looks the same still.  \nroot@xxxxxxxx:~# bash\nroot@xxxxxxxx:~# service <tab><tab>\nacpid                        plymouth-upstart-bridge  \napache2                      portmap  \napparmor                     portmap-wait  \n\nNow it's working. Just keep in mind that you'll have to double exit to exit the bash you just launched and then exit the sudo su session so you don't leave a root terminal open.\nroot@xxxxxxxx:~# uname -mrs\nLinux 3.8.0-33-generic x86_64  \nroot@xxxxxxxx:~# lsb_release -d\nDescription:    Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS\n\n\nA: I had the same problem.

After upgrading from Lubuntu 12.04 to 12.10 I see a lot of repositories disabled in the list of sources.\n\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: You have a lot of external repositories enabled. All external repositories are being disabled in the upgrade1 process to avoid conflicts and you were probably warned about this by the upgrade manager.\nThere's no simple \"yes, enable them all\" or \"no, don't do it\" advice to give here. And this is the reason why the upgrade manager left you to fix it manually.\nAfter a successful upgrade, check for the availability of packages for 12.10 in the entries and re-enable them in case you still want to use them2. Make sure to select the right release channel, e.g. quantal for PPAs. The upgrade manager has already replaced precise with quantal for you in this case I assume.\nSome external ones with a less specific release channel like stable might need adjustments if they are relying on precise shared library versions.

I received a Logitech H600 headphone set as a gift. \nWhen I plug it in to my Ubuntu 12.04 computer, it shows in the sound preferences as both a sound input device and output device. I can select it, but I cannot get any sound from it.\nDoes this headset work on Ubuntu, and if so, what do you have to do to get it working?\n\nA: Usually, when you see this headphone model under the sound as an input device and an output device, you simply have to pair the headset to the antenna if you are using it for the first time. Unfortunately, you need to use a Windows computer to do this, but after that it will work under Ubuntu. (I tried the utility under wine, but it didn't detect the device).\nPlug the reciever into a Windows computer, and download the pairing utility and start the utility.\nSwitch the headset on. Then, hold down the Volume up and Mute buttons on the headset until the LED blinks green quickly.\nThen, click next on the pairing utility.

Until I get a kernel working, I want to just run them on top of Ubuntu. Because of this, I need all filesystem calls directed to a different directory in my home folder, so accessing / from within Java would actually access /home/<user>/Thunderbolt/.\nI've looked at the community documentation for using chroot, but it says to set up a basic installation of Ubuntu in it. Is this really necessary? All I want is to run Java applications inside it so the app thinks it is in its own fake filesystem. I don't want all the extra Ubuntu stuff.\nAccording to the aforesaid docs:\n\nIn many ways, a chroot is like installing another operating system inside your existing operating system. \n\nBut I don't want this. All I want is to hide most of the real filesystem from the app so it sees only one directory.\nI've also seen the manpage for the chroot function. Will this do what I want?\nIs there any simple way to run a Java application in its own fake filesystem using chroot (without all the extra Ubuntu stuff), and if so, how?\n\nA: What I did was create a directory called Thunderbolt in my home folder. Then for the executables I wanted, I ran ldd and copied the needed libraries and the actual executable into my Thunderbolt directory, like\n$ ldd /bin/bash\n    linux-gate.so.1 =>  (0xb7781000)\n    libtinfo.so.5 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libtinfo.so.5 (0xb7743000)\n    libdl.so.2 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0xb773e000)\n    libc.so.6 => /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0xb7593000)\n    /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xb7782000)\n\nFor Java itself, along with copying the needed libraries, I used mount --bind to bind the Java home directory (/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-i386/):\n$ mount --bind -o ro /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-i386/ sys/java/\n\nTo run the chroot, I created a script called thunderbolt that called .profile (which set up the environment) than ran my Java app (/sys/Thunderbolt.sys is a Jar file, I just changed the extension):\nsource /.profile\n/sys/java/bin/java -jar /sys/Thunderbolt.sys Files\n\nTo run the chroot, I used the following command\nsudo chroot /home/mspencer/Thunderbolt /bin/bash /thunderbolt\n\nNOTE: This doesn't work perfectly yet, I'm getting this warning whenever I run Java: OpenJDK Server VM warning: Can't detect initial thread stack location - find_vma failed\n", "Q: How to mount an Android Jelly Bean phone if there's no option?

It meant a two-click distance to things like starting and stopping servers, or gaining a shell in a particular server.\nIs there an equivalent to this in Unity?\nI've tried creating desktop icons, but they always seem to get bundled together on the unity bar, making the tooltip misleading and difficult to find a currently running shell on a particular server.  (e.g. The tooltip always lists the name of the first server called as a shell, and separate to shells called from the unity bar.)\nI've heard that I can create special commands that enable me to right-click an icon in the unity bar, is that the better solution to this?\nIdeally, I'd like to be able to visually select an icon, since each one of my servers has it's own unique icon anyway for this sort of thing.\n\nA: Try Drawers for an easy (drag-n-drop) way to create custom launchers. It's an app I wrote to bundle together different launchers or shortcuts for files, weblinks, etc. It's easy to edit contents names and execution lines once they're added to the drawer (right-click items and choose Edit Properties).\nHere's a video I recently created to show its usage. \nHere's what it looks like when you open a drawer:\n\nAny items you add to the drawer will be available also through Quicklists (right-clicking the launcher) so opening a drawer isn't even necessary.\nI will be releasing a new version shortly (13.1.1) that has a number of improvements including launching applications in terminals.\nTo install add the repository:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ian-berke/ppa-drawers\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install drawers\n\n\nA: You could create a custom launcher pointing to a script with all the switches you want to execute.\n", "Q: Is it possible to convert LVM filesystem back to normal? My filesystem setup is an LVM setup.  I'm wanting to try installing ElementaryOS Luna Beta 1 on its own partition, but unfortunately it doesn't support LVM yet.\nIs there any easy way to do this?\n\nA: If you're willing to wipe everything in the LVM, then yes: Just delete the LVM partition and let the new distribution's installer create whatever it needs, or do so manually before or during the installation.\nIf you want to save some or all of what's in your LVM, then it gets more complex. One option is to shrink your LVM to make room for the new distribution. This will require either heavy-duty command-line tools like various LVM command and fdisk or gdisk; or use of a GUI LVM front-end like system-config-lvm. Another option is to back up your data, delete the LVM, and restore everything to a non-LVM setup. Another is to install a new hard disk and use that for your new distribution, leaving the current LVM setup intact. Yet another option is to install LVM support into the new distribution. This can probably be done just by adding the right packages to the installer, but I can't be sure of that.\n\nA: No, you cannot convert LVM logical volumes to partitions.\nHowever, you copy the logical volumes to another back-up disk, delete the LVM physical volumes on the original disk, create new partitions, and restore the data from the back-up.\nAlternatively, if you have enough free space on your hard disk, you can shrink the logical volumes, shrink the LVM physical volumes, create new partitions, copy the data from the logical volumes to the partitions, delete the LVM physical volumes, and then grow the partitions.\n", "Q: X crashes immediately on login The errors I get say there are problems loading the Nvidia kernel modules, but I tried purging the Nvidia drivers also with no success.

All newer applications should be developed with GTK+ 3 because GTK+ 2 has reached its end of life. Nevertheless, there may be legitimate reasons for developing an application with GTK+ 2, such as backward compatibility with older distributions.\nI'm not sure if you are aware of the fact, that both versions of Glade that you've mentioned above are already packaged for Ubuntu 12.10. You can install Glade 3.14 using the terminal with the command\nsudo apt-get install glade\n\nand Glade 3.8 with the command\nsudo apt-get install glade-gtk2\n\nThere is actually no need to manually download and compile Glade, unless you want to develop Glade itself.\n", "Q: Upstart conf changes do not reload after edit After I make some changes to an upstart conf file upstart does not reload the new changes until I reboot the system\nstart on filesystem or runlevel [23]\nstop on runlevel [6] \n\nrespawn \nexpect fork \n\nscript \n    echo \"Starting gunicorn..\" > /tmp/upstart_t \n    exec /srv/sms/mwav_messenger/gunicorn_start.sh \nend script \n\nconsole output\n\nIf I was to alter this script I would continue to get the original behaviour. Further to this if I stop or start the script manually the commandline simply hangs and I need to control-c to get back to the commandline.\nCheers.\n\nA: Changes to Upstart scripts apply when all running instances of that job have stopped. Thus modifying a conf file and doing sudo restart job will run it with old values. You need to sudo stop job, then sudo start job to have new conf file in effect.\nBonus: sudo stop job getting stuck at such script means you have wrong expect stanza defined.

I am having trouble finding an answer to a question about protecting unencrypted data. I run Ubuntu 12.04. Although I'm not sure that it's relevant, I'll also mention that I use an encrypted home directory (and thus also have encrypted Swap space) but do not use full-disk encryption. My hard drive is formatted with ext4.\nI have a text file that contains some application passwords. I keep this file encrypted using GPG. Whenever I want to edit the passwords in the file, I use GPG to write the decrypted contents to disk, edit the text in my favourite text editor (currently, Gedit), have GPG re-encrypt the file, and then rm the unencrypted version.\nRecently, I've realized that in being written to disk, the unencrypted text could possibly be read from the disk itself if it's not overwritten. I realize that shred really doesn't work for this purpose with a journaling filesystem like ext4. I read at https://stackoverflow.com/a/12289967 that it's possible to write the unencrypted file to a tmpfs -- i.e., directly to RAM or Swap space. The post that I linked to suggests using /dev/shm; however, my understanding is that that directory is intended to be used for shared memory operations, and has also been deprecated in favor of /run/shm. It sounds like writing to /run might be a better idea, then.\nIf I were to write the decrypted file to /run (or, for that matter, to /dev/shm), would there be any adverse consequences? Would the file be protected more than if it were written straight to disk (like I've been doing)? Is writing to those directories a bad idea for reasons I don't even know to think of?\nI'll be very grateful for any advice that you can offer. Thank you!\n\nA: \nIf I were to write the decrypted file to /run (or, for that matter, to\n  /dev/shm), would there be any adverse consequences?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*For your use-case (text files, which can't get very big), no.\n\n\n\nWould the file be protected more than if it were written straight to\n  disk (like I've been doing)?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*You understand things correctly. Saving sensitive data to\nun-encrypted non-volatile magnetic media is a practice best avoided\n-- if there's an alternative.\n\n\n\nIs writing to those directories a bad idea for reasons I don't even\n  know to think of?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Nope. You're good to go. Just keep in mind that if you're writing directly to one of these tmpfs mount points, due-diligence would demand you make sure your shell umask is set appropriately when decrypting the file -- gpg could very well end up creating the decrypted file with world-readble permissions.\n\n\nLastly: I won't give any recommendations for password managers because I've never tried any; however, I did develop a comprehensive GnuPG/OpenSSL encryption (GUI) frontend written in Python that you might be interested in.

I click on install Ubuntu and when it comes to partitions, I don't understand a thing. I have a 640gb hard drive, 32gb USB and another 4gb USB which contains the Ubuntu installation. Is it a good idea to use my 32gb USB for partition? Do I have to shrink a partition in Windows and then use it on Ubuntu? How do I know which partition is which? \nThank you for help!\n\nA: 1st thing you need to do is create empty space from within Windows by downsizing your Windows. It is best to do this on the 640 Gb hard disc and you need a 25 Gb or more. Depending on what you want to do with Ubuntu. If you want to use it to download and save lots of files or large files you need a bit more than 25 Gb. \nAt the point where the installer starts about partitioning you can then choose \"use empty space\" and have it install using the empty space. When you can a bit more experienced try different partitioning methods (most of us use '/', swap and '/home' as a setup).\n", "Q: windows 7 drivers compatible with ubuntu in lenovo ideapad s100? I am planning to install Ubuntu on my Lenovo Ideapad S100 with the following specifications:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel atom CPU N570 1.66GHz \n\n*1.67 GHz 2GB RAM. \n\n\nI only have the required drivers for Windows 7 32 bit.  \nWill my windows 7 drivers work in Ubuntu? Do I also need drivers for Ubuntu? In case I need drivers, where should I get them?\n\nA: \nWill my windows 7 drivers work in ubuntu?  \n\nNo\n\nDo I also need drivers for ubuntu? \n\nYes, but they come WITH the installation of Ubuntu. Most of them that is since there is a bit of hardware that is not compatible with Ubuntu. To check if your system works out of the box with Ubuntu you can use the Live CD part of the installation media. \nYour system has been used before by others so you are good to go from what I can tell. I did see some issues with the network card (Realtek) but that was with older versions of Ubuntu. If these still exist you might need to change the software that is used to connect to the internet (network manager) to WICD.\n\nA: Windows 7 drivers and Ubuntu drivers are completely different so no you cannot use your Windows drivers. However when you install you will have the required drivers automatically downloaded.\nIf you're worried about hardware you aren't forced to install but you can still check if everything works correctly prior to installing by booting off a live CD or USB: Try Ubuntu before you install also check if your laptop is listed as Certified Hardware this should give you an idea of what sort of performance to expect with your hardware. \nIf you need to install graphics drivers, theres also a helpful step by step guide on the Ubuntu Community Help Wiki site which could be handy if you'd like to check any issues yourself prior to asking for further help.\nOverall I'd suggest you try it out on a live USB and if there are any issues (sometimes there are with wireless/graphics drivers) give the questions on this site a look, as many hardware driver issues are already resolved. \n", "Q: 2 hard disk drives with ubuntu I've just downloaded Ubuntu 12.04 and I've already installed it on 2 hard disk drives, however, I want to use one disk as an storage disk (160GB) and I want to use the other one for work (30GB). \nHow can I tell to the system that I want to initialize with the disk of 30 Gb and I want to left the other one (160GB) connected and using it as storage?\nI would be very glad to receive any suggestions. \n\nA: During install your are prompted on what to do. Choose 'manual configuration'. Select the 30Gb disc (probably called sdb1; but check the size for it being around 30Gb) and create partitions on that disc. One of these needs to be called /, you also 'need' a swap and preferably a /home and this will be used as the start up disc. \nThe 160 Gb disc you can mount with a mount point (example /documents or /pluto.) The system will create a directory inside the root system with that name where this disc is accessible (after you set the correct permissions) for you to store documents on.\n\nPermissions (from terminal): chown $USER:$USER /{mountpont} Just change the {mountpoint} and the $USER will be dealt with by the system.\n", "Q: How do I mount Zyxel NSA310 shares? I have a Zyxel NSA310 NAS, which is working fine with Windows machines in the house. I've also successfully created and mounted an NFS share on the two Ubuntu machines.\nBut I'd like to mount the standard Windows shares (photo, music and video), and I've had no luck. File manager finds the homestore (the NSA310's default name) on the network but won't let me drill down. Going straight to smb: doesn't work. And editing /etc/fstab with plausible-looking entries yields errors.\nDoes anyone have experience of this useful device? Surely I'm not the only one who's wrestled with it?!\n\nA: In my opinion the fastest way is to mount via cifs. Run the following command (by making necessary changes):\nmount -t cifs //se.rv.er.IP/video /ubuntu_path -o rw,user=xxx,password=yyy\n\nIf you don't have cifs installed; you may do so by running the following command:\nsudo apt-get install cifs\n\n\nA: I know, old question, but for me it works like this, this is my line from /etc/fstab:\n//192.168.1.100/video /media/local-folder cifs credentials=/home/user1/.smbcredentialsWrite,vers=1.0,noauto,rw,gid=1000,uid=1000 0 0\n\nwhere my ~/.smbcredentialsWrite contains login credentials in form:\nusername=uuuuuu\npassword=ppppp\n\nI think that in my case catch was that NSA310S is sharing with smb 1.0 - older version.\n", "Q: How do I install 'proper' anti-virus protection for Online Banking satisfying its Terms of Use?

By accident, I selected swap as the whole partition, which I intended on using it in Linux.

Now I opened this link and I got a zip file of the same linux-sunxi. How do I install this zip file? I mean what is difference between cloning and a zip file?\n\nA: If git clone ... takes too long and you just want to checkout one revision (i.e. you don't want all the history) of the repository, do this:\ngit clone --depth 1 protocol://path/to/repo\n\nAs from this answer on StackOverflow. This gets you the latest commit, without history. It's still gonna take you a long time, as it appears to be the whole Linux kernel...\nA regular clone is a repository with all its history and commit messages. The ZIP-file just contains the state of the repository at a single commit (snapshot) without any history. This --depth option provides you a way to do this with Git without the need for a ZIP file for every commit.\nAbout the ZIP-files on Github in particular. If the developer of the repository determines to tag a specific commit (i.e. puts a label with a nice name on the commit hash like \"version 1.0\"), the contents of the repository is made available as a ZIP/TAR file on Github for your convenience. There should be no difference between the two, besides the version of it as the clone command is likely to give you a newer (probably experimental) version.\nTo make things more complicated, but necessary to be correct in this answer, the clone only checks out the default branch, whereas the ZIP-file on Github may be created from a tag in another branch (release for example).\nAs stated in the comment, further instructions on how to install this particular piece of software is documented very well in the README.\n", "Q: Bluetooth and wifi get switched on and off together I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 with GNOME on a Dell Inspiron 1470, my wlan card is a Broadcom BCM4312.

Does anyone know how I can insert the interpunct character (also known as midline decimal) in Ubuntu? The combination mentioned in the Wikipedia article does not seem to work:\nAlt Gr + .\n\nA: The default way to do this is given in the Ubuntu Help page: The Gtk Dead Key Compose Table. The sequence for the middle dot is: ThirdLevel Chooser + DeadKey-Cirucmflex + period or expanded: AltGr + Shift + AltGr + Shift + ^ + .. This is supposed to work even without changing keyboard options.\nCompose key combinations, however, did not work reliably on my system until I set a compose key in the Keyboard Layout.\nSettings > Keyboard Layout > Options > Expand Compose Key Position and choose the key you want. I chose RightAlt so now, RightAlt + Shift (now in 3rd level) + Shift + ^ + . inserts the middle dot.\n\nA: Simply press Ctrl+Shift+U, then type 00b7 Enter, i.e. the Unicode value of interpunct character.\n\nA: Copy an interpunct · from Wikipedia or anywhere. Paste and save it in a document on your desktop. Copy from there and paste when you need to use it.\nOr, from your word processing program's toolbar, go to insert, select special character, choose the raised dot (6th row down, 12th over in Microsoft Works), and change the font size to whatever you want it to be. It isn't perfect (it's much lower than an actual interpunct) but it's a little higher than a period. \nAlso the lower case letter l in both wingdings and webdings makes a black dot but it isn't much higher than a period. Lower case h in Marlett makes a similar dot, but quite a bit larger and Marlett keeps inserting a box for a blank space, which is kind of a nuisance. You could type all the upper and lower case keys on your keyboard, then try out each font in your system to see if any of them produce a better looking \"interpunct.\"\nHere is a larger interpunct if you would like to copy it for pasting elsewhere:\ninterpunct • interpunct\n\nA: I use US international layout and I can write the interpunct with AltGR + . (release all the keys) and then the keys that needs the interpunct. For example the interpunct between the two Ls in \"Paraŀlel\"\n\nA: UPDATE : using Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS\nyou can find in the layout of your keyboard all the keys (see illustration below). In my case with a french keyboard it is pressing the following keys : Alt + /\n\n\nA: The raised dot (·) is included in the polytonic Greek keyboard, the dot is useful as one types ancient greek. Below is an example with the keyboard installed on Ubuntu. You would press: Level (or AltGR) + q\n\n\nA: It depends on your keyboard settings. With 105 keys keyboard in German Layout the combination is\nAlt Gr + ,  (comma).\n", "Q: VLC is lagging when playing HD videos over my home network I am well aware that this question has been asked about a billion times all over the Internet but so far nothing has worked for me...\nI have a home server (Ubuntu Server 12.04) and a laptop (Ubuntu Desktop 12.04) connected to the same local network (both wired to my router).\nWhat I am trying to do is to access my server from my laptop (ssh) to play HD movies (located on the server) directly on my laptop (using VLC).\nIt works just fine with 720p format movies, but as soon as I try with 1080p movies, it starts to lag badly.\nI have tried all the usual tricks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Increasing the caching value\n\n*Setting the option \"Skip the loop filter for H.264 decoding\" to \"All\"\n\n*Change the \"Video output module\" value\n\n\nNone of them worked for me. By increasing the caching value though, it actually seemed to work because it \"buffers\" for a while before starting the video, but after a while the movie stops and starts to \"buffer\" again...\nNote:\nIf the movie is located on my laptop, it works good.\nSame issue with other players (Totem, MPlayer etc...)\nThis issue has been killing me for a while now, anybody knows how to solve this?\nThank you very much in advance.\nChris\n\nInformation about my laptop:\n\n\n*\n\n*HP Pavilion dv6\n\n*Processor: 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7-2670Q\n\n*Memory: RAM 6 GB DDR3\n\n*Video: AMD Radeon HD 6490M (1 GB DDR5 dedicated, up to 4 GB total)\n\n\nA: Thanks \"AbrahamVanHelpsing\" for your replies and sorry for the delay.\nI have finally fixed my issue and thought it may be helpful for others as well..\nAfter struggling I found out that nothing was wrong with my VLC setup. I could actually just have left the default settings. The problem was my connection speed...\nI was convinced that it wouldn't be the issue since my router is supposed to provide up to 150 Mbps (so nearly 20 MB/s). Well, as it turned out I was wrong... I checked my connection speed by transferring a file from my server to my laptop (using the scp command line) and was amazed to see a poor 970 KB/s transfer speed.\nthis rate was of course not enough. To watch a HD movie over a network you need at least 2.5 MB/s.\nFollowing this article, I understood that it is advised to reboot your home internet connection from time to time. I then restarted my router and the problem was gone! The scp transfer was progressing around 5 MB/s, letting me smoothly watch my HD movies :)\nPs: I also installed XBMC and the result is just amazing!\nThanks again for your time and I hope this thread will be useful to others.\nChris\n\nA: bit late but someone else will have the same problem as i'm using an old Dell 780 core2 quad @3000, and there are loads on the market at the moment\nhad the same problem with vlc playing off a nas \nmy windows install (dual booting) and android devices have no problem playing the same files, in ubuntu/vlc the screen would freeze with a grey colour and then a few seconds later would start playing properly\nI fixed it by going into vlc tools/preferences (then select show all) /Input/Codec/Access Modules/ and set it to file.\ni then went to tools/preference /input/codecs and set network default caching policy to higher latency, restarted vlc and it was fixed for me\n", "Q: can i use an ubuntu live usb/cd without damaging my windows 8 pc? I have a windows 8 laptop with intel i3 and 750gb hard drive.\nI don't want to install Ubuntu instead of windows and have heard horror stories about only being able to have one system on the hard drive because Microsoft have prevented partitioning or something like that. Can I run Ubuntu from a live USB stick or external hard drive without damaging windows?\nthanks\n\nA: Yes, aslong as you don't install ubuntu/edit partitions you are fine.\nThe live version just loads itself into your ram, and runs. You can however install programs on the ubuntu live version, it will be written to your ram too. Just don't install ubuntu/repartition your harddrive. \n", "Q: Unmounting and Mounting Drives I have a passport device that I plugged in using firewire that I use to house old , unused files so that my Mac computer would process more freely.  After I connect it the drive is read, I then move files over with no problem.  So that works done! Because I dont see where I can force a password when opening the Passport device (and I have some important files on it) I decided to unmount it. Once I unmount it I no longer see the drive. To see the drive again, do I have to unplug the firewire and replug it in or is there another way without me having to do that tedious task again and again?\n\nA: Try \"Disks\" application in Ubuntu for mount again without reconnecting.\nClick on the play/stop button for mount/unmount the drive.\n\n\n\nA: How exactly are you unmounting it?\nI ask this b/c if you're unmounting the drive by clicking the little arrow next to its name in your file manager, this actually is ejecting it.\n(Alot of people get confused b/w the umountcommand and the eject command. ejectcompletely removes the media, whilst umountunmounts it, but still leaves the media connected in the background)\nThe simple solution is to stop using that little arrow in your file manager. Instead right click on the drive name & choose the 'Unmount' option. However if you do accidentally eject it, heres a work around to stop having to reinsert the media again.\nOpen up the terminal & type ls -l /dev/disk/by-id\nFrom here, you need to check what device node the drive in question is linked to (if you have no other removable media connected it will probably be ../../sdb. This equates to /dev/sdb)\nThen its a case of doing sudo eject -t /dev/sdb (substitute /dev/sdb with what you got above).\nIts funny b/c the -t flag of the eject command is actually to close a CD-ROM tray, but it also seems to fool the system into thinking you've reinserted an external drive. \n`\n", "Q: How to run a particular command at startup? I don't understand scripts or how to make them or how to run them. All I want to do is run the command xmodmap -e \"keycode 112 = Delete\" when my computer starts. When I run this command in terminal, it remaps the PgDn key to be a second Delete key. But then I have to run it again every time I start the computer. How can I do this? I've tried adding it as a line in the rc.local file but it doesn't work.\n\nA: You can make it run at boot by adding it in startup applications.  Open startup applications from the dash.  Click 'Add' and put xmodmap -e \"keycode 112 = Delete\" in the 'Command' field.  Give it a name and comment if you want.  Click 'Add' and login again.  \n\n\nA: Seth's solution is a high-level solution that works fine as long as you don't change the desktop environment to something more exotic. To be on the secure side you might want to choose a method that acts at a lower level:\nOpen up a terminal (CTRL + ALT + T) and execute the following command:\necho \"xmodmap -e \\\"keycode 112 = Delete\"\\\" >> $HOME/.bashrc\n\nThis appends xmodmap -e \"keycode 112 = Delete\" to your .bashrc file and thus executes it on each login.\nEdit: As Mik pointed out this might not be the best way of setting xmodmap up. See here for a better method.\n", "Q: Where can I find Ubuntu .img file to use on Android?

I will be using visual studio on a Windows PC for the programming. I know how to make the install files for Windows.\nI just need to know how to make the files Linux uses for programs in Visual Studio?\nIf you don't know visual studio could some one tell be the extensions used on install files or runnable executable(for Linux).\n\nA: I have had some experience in cross platform programming. To begin with Visual Studio, code built on visual studio will not run inherently as the binaries compiled from Visual Studio wont be supported. You might try to develop in C# using Visual studio and then can use mono libraries to run that code on linux but wont recommend it at all. Another way would be to use gcc and compile ur code using mingw of cygwin on windows and use that compiled code on  windows and use gcc compiler to get binaries in linux. As for ide which is available for both the operating systems I would suggest Eclipse. \nBut if you want a good suggestion for cross platform development, then you should focus on all the operating systems independently as each have major differences.\nFurther with respect to qt, they again use mingw/cygwin (for windows) and generic linux libraries so you can consider them too (they give some good functional libraries too). Its just depends on what you are building!\n\nA: Visual c++ is not cross platform, If you prefer cross platform application creation from visual studio try qt plugin for visual studio\n\nA: Or look at the Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers.  http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-cc-developers/junosr1\n", "Q: Atheros AR8161 Ethernet card not working on 12.10 on an ASUS N56VM I have installed Ubuntu 12.10 (64bits) (3.5.0-18 kernel) on an ASUS N56VM and the ethernet card isn't working.

Whom should I ask for upgrading the particular package, if there is a new upstream release?\nShould I file a bug report?\nWhat if the package is maintained by Debian maintainers? Should I leave a comment at their mailing list?\n\nA: The maintainer of the package. He might already be working on it!\nHow? Doesn't really matter. I see bug reports for it, but usually this is discussed behind the scenes. I guess most is being discussed using IRC and mailing lists. Depends on the package and the people working on it.\nDebian/Ubuntu developers (package maintainers) are uploading new releases to experimental/unstable and will end up later in a stable channel via regular QA process. A new upstream release isn't usually going to be included in a stable release. Security or severe bugs come as regular updates, without backporting a whole new release.\nException: web browsers.\nSee also this answer on the policy regarding updates within Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Why screen resolution remains 640x480 when I close a game? I played Lugaru, the game went in Full screen mode, but when I closed the game, the screen resolution was still 640x480. It happened with Neighbours From Hell also, using Wine, and well... Almost every game i tried in fullscreen mode. Is it normal? Is there a fix for that?\n\nA: Fullscreen handling in Linux is rather broken and lots of games are causing such troubles. Easiest workaround is probably to use xrandr to bring things back into the proper resolution (put that in a script and make it an icon in the top/left corner of your screen for easy restore):\nFor a single monitor setup that would be simply something like:\nxrandr --output DFP2 --mode \"1680x1050\"\n\nFor a multimonitor setup it would look like:\nxrandr \\\n --output DFP2 \\\n   --mode \"800x600\" \\\n   --panning \"800x600+1280+0/0x0+0+0\" \\\n --output CRT1 \\\n   --mode \"1280x1024\" \\\n   --panning \"1280x1024+0+0/0x0+0+0\"\n\nRunning xrandr without any option give you a list of supported modes and available displays.\nNote there is also a bug in xrandr itself, sometimes the monitor size will adjust, but the mouse movement will still be locked to the old resolution, to fix that just run xrandr a second time.\nAlternatively you can also set wine to emulate a virtual desktop, this will prevent games from going fullscreen and force them to be confined to the Wine virtual desktop window. The setting available in winecfg and then Graphics->Emulate a virtual desktop.\n\nA: This happens to me sometimes when exiting a game. It seems random. I am not sure if it's a problem with Wine or the original game code (probably both). \nFor me, the command to go back to my native resolution was: \nxrandr --output HDMI-0 --preferred\n\n", "Q: Log files (CUPS) grow so fast! the past few days I faced a strange issue with my computer.

Normally, that wouldn't be a problem, since I have a different drive mapped to /home, but I'm scared that reinstalling will wipe /var/www and other directories where I have much-needed config files. \n\nA: It depends on how you partitioned your hard drive. But, if /var was not given its own partition, reinstalling Ubuntu will wipe /var. \nNot only would you need to backup /var/www, but you would also need to backup /var/lib/mysql, where your MySQL database lives.\n\nA: Starting with Ubuntu 18.04, a server install insists on wiping /var.

How can I delete all my local address book contact from Ubuntu 12.10?\nWhen I try to delete \"personal address book\" from thunder bird, I got this error\n\nSorry - this version of EDS Contacts Integration does not support\n  deleting Evolution address books. Due to the way that Thunderbird\n  tries to delete address books, all of your EDS address books will\n  appear to be removed from the address book manager.  Simply restart\n  Thunderbird in order to have them return.\n\nAlso I do not find a way to delete local contacts using \"gnome-contacts\".\nExtra information : All my contacts were imported from my mobile phone used \"Sync\" application\n\nA: If you have Evolution installed in gnome, you have actually two pieces of software: the Evolution client, and the Evolution Data Server (EDS which is package 'evolution-data-server-common' ). The latter allows the contacts to be shared between various other address books (like in Thunderbird and Gnome).\nIf you are not using evolution at all, you can uninstall it. EDS should be kept (it is not uninstalled in this process), so that other applications can also use it. You can also keep (or you can disable it if you want) the EDS contact integration add-on in TB. Since you are able to sync your mobile contacts with ubuntu, then you should notice under your TB address book a group 'contacts' which is updated automatically since you have EDS integration.\nYou can give more details in your question about the applications you have running regarding contacts.\n", "Q: Dual-boot bootrec /fixboot issues while uninstalling Ubuntu Good Day,\nI want to give Ubuntu more HDD space so I tried to create a new partition then merge it with my Ubuntu's.

So my first question is:\nIs it possible to completely avoid all this leaks, what EFF writing about?\n\nMysterious cite about 'trust us your data':\nThis article also has a citation of Mark Shuttleworth's words about privacy issues:\n\nWe are not telling Amazon what you are searching for. Your anonymity\n  is preserved because we handle the query on your behalf. Don’t trust\n  us? Erm, we have root. You do trust us with your data already. You\n  trust us not to screw up on your machine with every update. You trust\n  Debian, and you trust a large swathe of the open source community. And\n  most importantly, you trust us to address it when, being human, we\n  err.\n\nSee highlighted phrase.\nSo he says, that besides search leaks, some another data leaks a provided in Ubuntu? What about is he talking? What is the meaning of this phrase? \n\nA: \nYou do trust us with your data already.\n\nWhat they mean with this is that it would be very very very to do something you do not want them to.\nAll they need to do is have the update software ask for your sudo password and Canonical can do anything with your system: delete system files, copy your documents over to a cloud server, delete your bookmarks etc etc.\nObviously they are not going to do that since it would also end Ubuntu as an OS (imagine the slack they will get from Richard Stallman :D ).\nThe EFF does have a point though. The way it is setup is not about our privacy but about making a profit for Canonical and/or Aamazon. The way it is set up now is \"anyone who does not want this can remove it\" (opt-out). But privacy would be better guarded if it would be \"if you want it you can turn it on with this action\" (opt-in).\n\nA: Your first and primary question is asking if one can completely stop all the data leaks written about there. Like the second part of your question (which has been addressed in other answers here), this first question is practical and answerable. Furthermore, it's answered on that page.\n\n\n*\n\n*This is similar to but not quite the same as that question, which is about how to prevent results from appearing. Here, the focus is on options for the user to enhance privacy surrounding Amazon search results, so a wider variety of solutions are presented.\n\n\nThat EFF page is licensed under CC-BY 3.0; its content can be cited and reproduced here as CC-BY-SA 3.0. In case it goes away...\n\nHow to Disable Amazon Ads and Data Leaks\nYou can uninstall Dash's Amazon integration by removing the package\n  called unity-lens-shopping from your computer. If you are currently\n  using Ubuntu 12.10. you can click here to open\n  unity-lens-shopping in Ubuntu Software\n  Center, and then click the \"Remove\" button on the right. You can also\n  uninstall it by opening the Terminal app and typing:\nsudo apt-get remove unity-lens-shopping\n\nIf you want Dash to only search your local computer and not search the\n  Internet at all, you can open the Privacy app and switch \"Include\n  online search results\" from on to off, as pictured below.\n\nFinally, if you don't like the direction that Unity is going but you\n  still like the Ubuntu operating system, you can switch to a different\n  desktop environment altogether such as GNOME\n  3, KDE, or\n  Cinnamon.\nYou can get GNOME 3 by installing the package called\n  gnome-shell. You can get KDE by installing the\n  package called kde-full. And you can get Cinnamon by\n  adding the Cinnamon PPA to your\n  repositories\n  and then installing the package called cinnamon. Once\n  you have installed a new desktop environment, you can choose which one\n  you want to use from your login screen.

I have already read the question about Creating .desktop files to use on the \"Open with other application\" tab but this is not what I want, I want to be able to click on the file in Dash or in Nautilus and be able to open it with the specified app.\nFor example I have this case right now:\nWhen I click on an EXE file it does not get executed by Wine, instead I get the following:\n\nIf I try to look for Wine in the Open With context menu option it is there. I am fine executing it from there the first time, but then the following times Wine does not appears selected in the main Context menu:\n\nI then went to Properties to the Open With Tab to look for Wine. It was not in the Default apps nor was it in the Recommended ones when I clicked and search on Show other applications\n\nThis is not limited to EXE extensions. It also has happened with MKV files, MP4 files, JPG, PNG, MP3 and even SVG and CSS.

So for the cases where it actually does not work, how to fix it. A reset of the extension?, An update of the files that can open said extension?, an addition of the app via a command line or GUI tool?\n\nA: You can use the command mimeopen, in a terminal go to the folder where your .exe file is and type\nmimeopen -d filename.exe\nYou will get a popup menu, where you can see some options, but there is also an option 'Other...', choose this one, then type the command which you would use if you would open the file in the terminal and replace the filename with %f. So in this case you would type wine %f. \nNow the default association for all exe files should be changed to wine.\nAlternative, using Ubuntu-Tweak as described in Change all associations from gedit to another application will also change the default app associated.\n\nA: In Ubuntu 21.10 (and probably all other distros using GNOMES File Manager Nautilus) you can also open files (Nautilus) -> click on the file -> Properties -> Open With -> Select the desired Application -> Set as Default.\n\nMind however, that file extension are not how GNOME determins with what programm to open a file, but based on file type (Better explained here).\n", "Q: Where is the \"pysdm\" package?

It runs the linux-image-server kernel, x86_64 arch.\nThere's nothing particularly unusual running, I think -- a deluge daemon, apache2, iptables firewall with IP masquerading, DHCP server, bind DNS server which has zone files updated automatically with the hostnames DHCP clients identify themselves with, sshd, nfs server, a handful of other things. This machine is my router -- it sits between the internet and the local network.\nSince the upgrade it has been failing intermittently. It'll be fine for a while after booting and then suddenly we'll lose our network connections on wifi. If I plug in a network cable I can't get an IP address from the DHCP server. If I set myself a static IP address I can continue to access the internet just fine. This makes it look like it's the DHCP server that fails (indeed, I run dhclient -v eth0 and nothing responds to the dhcpdiscover shoutouts), noticed when the clients try to renew their IP leases. But wired with a static IP I can still get to the internet, so iptables is still chugging along just fine.\nSo I try to log in to the machine over SSH, but it seems to hang. If I make ssh verbose I see that it does establish a connection to the server, then fails a little further down the line -- hard to see where exactly.\nI note that if I try to grab a web page from its HTTP server I get the page I request but any extra requests made (for images, stylesheets, javascripts) are not served. I can however get these files if I request them directly, for instance from curl.\nIs this suggesting that things are going downhill whenever something attempts to fork?\nI dragged a monitor and keyboard to the server (it's usually headless) and had a look -- I see stack traces.\nI switch to a fresh virtual terminal and attempt to log in.

What can I do?\n\nA: It seems it was indeed a memory issue. Memtest gave some errors on one of the four modules, and after removing this module it hasn't crashed since. Thanks for all the suggestions.\n\nA: I would use the older kernel (2.6.x) first before jumping onto the hardware. If Ubuntu 10 kernel is still installed, reboot the machine and run the server with the old kernel. Ubuntu 12 is 3.x? while Ubuntu 10 is 2.6.x.\nIf 2.6 linux-image is not available, you can add the lucid repository to /etc/apt/sources.list.d, do \"apt-get update\", and \"aptitude versions linux-image\" and install 2.6 kernel.\nIf the situation does not change with the older kernel, you can conclude that it's not the kernel but hardware. If the situation improves, it's probably either buggy driver or kernel. AFAIK, using older kernel does not affect your system. I've installed 2.6 kernel from Lucid and used it with Precise in order to avoid the Intel graphics problem and my machine worked just fine.\nOnly annoying part of it was that I had to hack the \"grub\" (/etc/grub.d/) in order for the 2.6 kernel to show up in the grub menu so that I can edit /etc/default/grub to choose the 2.6 kernel as default, and I had to edit the /etc/grub.d/ multiple times since every time I take the linux-image update, it reverts the hacked files in /etc/grub.d/*. (Maybe someone else knows how to use the older version of kernel as default in grub.)\n", "Q: How to open a new tab in the server command line? What are the keyboard shortcuts to manipulate tabs (open new tab, navigate between tabs ...) in the command line of ubuntu server 12.04?\n\nA: For doing command line work in general I would recommend using screen, tmux or other of these sort, but to get started, try out byobu:\n\nDefault key bindings: \n\n\n*\n\n*F2 create a tab\n\n*F3 & F4 you can move around back and forth\n\n*F6 detach session.

Currently I'm running an Ubuntu 12.04 dual-boot (together with Windows 7) installation on my Dell Inspiron 1545 Laptop configuration.

I made some links to files in a folder.  When I added that folder to Dropbox, the links contained duplicate copies of the files linked to.  Have you had this problem?  Do you understand what is happening?  Is there a solution?\nTo make this question clearer:  In the \"type\" column of the file manager, before connecting to Dropbox, Link_to_notes was shown to be a link and the size was 32 bytes.  After connecting to Dropbox, Link_to_notes was shown to be a plain text document and the size was 18.7 kB, the size of the notes file.\n\nA: The best way to do it is to store the files in the dropbox folder and symlink to them from outside...\nSo create ~/Dropbox/Documents and symlink:\nln -s ~/Dropbox/Documents ~/Documents\n\nThis stops dropbox getting confused and de-linking anything that is a link inside because you have all the things inside and instead when you want them elsewhere you link to them in dropbox.  The basic rule is don't have any symlinks anywhere inside the dropbox folder...have them outside the dropbox folder and you'll have no problem. \nI have dropbox on several ubuntu machines and have all my major top level folders actually stored in dropbox.\n\nA: dropbox will follow sym links to directories, but it will break a link (either sym or hard) to a file and replace it with a file.\n\nA: TL;DR: Below is a way to get behavior quite similar to symbolic links, at the graphical user interface (GUI) level only, which is especially helpful if you don't want DropBox repeatedly copying the same files to different folders within the DropBox hierarchy just because you want to view them from different places (i.e., folder paths).\nBackground\nMore than once I've been burned by DropBox duplicating folders if I create a symbolic links (symlinks) within the DropBox folder hierarchy, even to the point of filling my account.  As many have noted around the web, there's no real fix for DropBox's lack of treating symbolic links properly, which is unfortunate as it would not be hard for them to do so.\nWorkaround\nOne workaround I use, however, to achieve the equivalent behavior of symlinks within the DropBox hierarchy --- what others often refer to as \"internal symlinks\" --- without DropBox duplicating everything is to create the equivalent of a Windows shortcut file (i.e., a .lnk file in the MS ecosystem).  I do so by creating a .desktop file that opens my system's file manager to the desired path.  Thus, this workaround only works at the GUI level and only for XDG compliant systems (e.g., Ubuntu, GNOME-based systems, many others).\nExample\nFor example, I'm reading up on advanced Python techniques for a new job I'm taking, and the PDFs I'm reading are stored on my DropBox folder for the GoodReader App (iOS) so I can read them both at my desktop and with my mobile devices.  Rather than having to drill down to that folder (/home/morse/lib/active/GoodReader/Books/Python), I simply create a Python.desktop folder under /home/morse/Desktop with the following contents:\n#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open\n\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nName=Python\nExec=nautilus /home/morse/lib/active/GoodReader/Books/Python\nIcon=/usr/share/icons/MacBuntu-OS/places/96/stock_folder.png\nTerminal=false\n\n(Note: Be sure to adapt the Exec=nautilus ... portion if you are using a file manager other than Nautilus, and of course you will want to adapt the Name=, Icon=, and path portion of the Exec= line for each \"symlink\" you wish to create.)\nWith this, I see a folder named Python on my desktop that acts just like a symbolic link --- that is, I double-click it and it opens the appropriate folder --- but only a small text file (e.g., Python.desktop) gets sync'd to DropBox and my other systems (as opposed to all the contents eventually being duplicated everywhere by DropBox).\nAs with other .desktop files, permissions must be set such that the file is both readable and executable (e.g., chmod 700 Python.desktop or chmod 755 Python.desktop) for the indicated icon to display and for double-clicking it to actually do anything.\nSummary\nIn summary, then, I'll always have the actual files available somewhere within DropBox --- in this example, /home/morse/lib/active/GoodReader/Books/Python --- but I'll also have a desktop \"shortcut\" to it across all my linux-based systems for which I also have DropBox configured.\nOf course, this workaround does not work at the command-line level, as a true symlink would.\nThat said, this does appear to be a novel workaround at the GUI level, one I've not seen posted elsewhere.  So, I'm hopeful this approach can be of use to others.\n\nA: DropBox follows symbolic links and treats them as directories. It's really useful for backing up without having to move files and directories into your DropBox directory.\n$ ln -s ~/Documents/ ~/Dropbox/Documents\n\nor store the files in DropBox and create a symbolic link in the opposite direction\n$ ln -s ~/Dropbox/Documents/ ~/Documents\n\n\nA: Compress your links and save the compressed file to Dropbox\nThe previous replies are exhaustive and clear. I just suggest three workarounds, based on a single principle. The third looks more difficult but it is very efficient.\nThe idea is: compress your symlinks to a tar file, which Dropbox will not treat as a link, and save it to Dropbox. The third way is almost as direct as copying your links directly to your Dropbox -- actually much faster than copying several links one by one.\nI have some twenty symbolic links I normally use in my Lubuntu installation, e.g. for quick access to bash scripts saved in Dropbox, to external hdds, to documents frequently used, etc. They are all in my home dir and in Desktop and I find it convenient to have a Dropbox copy of them to use for other installations or when I dist-upgrade (that is, when I reinstall after trying to dist-upgrade ;).\n1st way\nYou make a directory called MyLinks (say, in Documents) and copy all your home symlinks to it; if you have symlinks in other directories, make subdirs in MyLinks and copy your symlinks to them. For example, if the links you want to save are in home and in Desktop, copy the home links to MyLinks, make a dir called Desktop in it and copy the Desktop links to it. Then open a Terminal, cd Documents (provided that this is the directory where MyLinks is) and make a tar file:\ntar -cvf MyHomeLinks.tar MyHomeLinks\n\n(Remember to add the \".tar\" extension to the tarfile name, or Ubuntu Archive Manager would refuse to open it.) \nIf you do this, just be careful not to add the option -h (--dereference) to tar because it would precisely behave as Dropbox and compress the target files instead of the symlinks. (By the way, such a behavior would be welcome in most cases, esp. if one aims at portability, but it is not if one wants to save the symlinks as symlinks.)\nThe tar file would also include links that are temporarily broken, such as links to external hdds not currently mounted -- which is fine.\nSave the tar file in your Dropbox. When you need the links back, copy the tar file to a directory in your file system (not within Dropbox), extract it (just right click and choose \"Extract here\") and copy your symbolic links back to the locations where you want them.\n2nd way\nIf the symlinks you want to save have a univocal prefix (such as \"MySl\"...) you can very quickly make your tarfile in this way (unnecessary spaces added to prevent mistakes):\nfind   .   -name   \"MySl*\"|xargs  tar  cvf  MyLinks.tar\n\nThe single dot after \"find\" means the current directory: open the Terminal in your home dir (as by default). You can surely add a path to the tar file and you can issue the command from another directory that is not home: replace the \".\" with the path to your home/user. No need to make work directories as MyLinks above. Restoring the symlinks is also quick: you copy the tarfile to your home, right click on it and \"extract here\".\nHowever, before starting to prefix all the names of your symlinks, have a look at the next option.\n3rd way (and best)\nA very quick way for collecting all of your symlinks in a tar file is: open a Terminal in your home/user (which is default when you open a Terminal) and:\nfind  .  -type  l|xargs  tar  -cvf  AllLinks.tar\n\nThe drawback is, you get ALL of your links in it, including some mozilla or hplip symlinks you didn't even know you had. To avoid this and to copy all and only the symlinks from a specified list of directories without recursion, you write the list after \"find\" in the command above. Say you want to save the links from home/user and Desktop; you can write\n find /home/<USER>/ /home/<USER>/Desktop/ -maxdepth 1 -type l|xargs tar -cvf MyLinks.tar\n\n\"-maxdepth 1\" is to prevent find from recursing through home. You can add a path to tarfile if you wish. Alternatively:\n find .  Desktop -maxdepth 1 -type l|xargs tar -cvf MyLinks.tar\n\nIf you are lazy and you want to use this often, you can add it as an alias to .bashrc or to .bash_aliases in your home dir (.bash_aliases is a very convenient way for collecting your aliases and, why not, saving them to Dropbox...). Just create a new empty file called .bash_aliases in your home dir (that is, /home/user), open it with a text editor and write the following line in it:\nalias save_symlinks='find . Desktop -maxdepth 1 -type l|xargs tar -cvf MyLinks.tar'\n\nReplace the directories after \"find\" with the ones of your choice and \"save_symlinks\" with a command name of your choice.\nTo restore, open your File manager (if the path to the directories in the command above is not absolute, the tarfile must be in home/user), right click and extract.\nIf you do this, life is easier. All you have to do is:\nSAVE: type save_symlinks in the Terminal, save the tarfile in your home to Dropbox;\nRESTORE: copy the file from Dropbox to your home dir, right click on it and select \"extract here\".\n", "Q: LightDM freezes at first startup Nearly every time I bootup my Ubuntu I come to the login screen.

While copying from my laptop's NTFS harddrive the rate was about 20mb/s. In the opposite direction, however, the rate is about 3mb/s. Am I missing something important or is there something wrong?\n\nA: There are several issues that may affect write performance and explain what you're experiencing. Without more technical details about your machine I can't tell you which of these are really relevant, but the usual suspects are:\n\n\n*\n\n*As stonedsquirrel pointed out in comments, write performance depends on filesystem. Under Linux, copying to an ext4 partition is expected to be faster copying to an NTFS one. ext4 is managed by a kernel driver, and it's highly optmized since it's the default filesystem in most Linux distribuitions, while NTFS (usually NTFS-3G from Tuxera) is a driver that runs in user-space, so it is much slower.\n\n*NTFS suffer a lot from fragmentation, and a heavily fragmented partition may have slower write performance.\n\n*Laptop's hardrives are optimized for lower power consumption, while desktop harddrives usually aim for performance. They usually run at 5400rpm (or lower), in comparison of 7200 from desktop HDDs. Other power-saving features may also trade in performance for longer battery life.\nThat said, both 20mb/s (for copying to an ext4, desktop hdd) and 3mb/s (for an ntfs, laptop hdd) seem quite normal\n\nA: I just tried the option big_writes with NTFS USB drive, helps quite a bit.

When you enter the overlay view and hold Alt, you'll see some numbers appear over your windows; Alt+number will select a particular window.\n\nA: There are a few nice keyboard shortcuts that very useful for Gnome. Most keybindings can be viewed under the User Menu -> System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts \nbut for your viewing pleasure = snippit:\nThis page contains brief descriptions of many GNOME Shell features, such as keybindings, drag and drop capabilities, and special utilities. \n", "Q: Why when copying to an external drive the progress window is not correct Feel free to edit the title to explain better what I am going to write here.\nWhen I copy big files to a pen drive for example, the progress window shows an estimate that most of the time does not fail to show the real time and percent to finish, but there are cases where it says everything is finished and the progress window closes. I go to extract the pen drive and it says it is still in use. After checking the pen drive I see it is still copying the files but there is no progress window showing this.\nIt does not only happen with big files, it also happens with many small files. If I copy them, the progress bar might say 15 seconds for example and finish in that time, but the real time might be 1 minute and for the next 45 seconds I need to actually look at the light in the pen drive to see if there is real activity on it.\nI do not want to know how to fix it since I have read how deep a fix for this could go. What I want to know is why does then the progress window show an estimate that does not correspond with the process of copying.\nIs it dependent of the Cache in the external unit?\nIs the file size and amount of file influence on the correct estimation. For example 1 file of 4 GB or 1000 files of 4 MB.\nIs there configuration options that can change the behavior.\nThere are other questions similar to this like copying files to usb stick never finished but am more focus on the mechanics into why it would behave like this.\n\nA: I would suppose you are using Nautilus as your file manager and if so there are long-standing bugs about this. Too numinous to mention effecting Mint, Fedora, Red Hat and all the like. Ubuntu is not without this same issue.\nSome suggest turning off thumbnail view helps. Others put their hopes in the \"newest kernel\" but this still exists.  \nThe problem = Starts off fast, then goes slower\nThis is because when mounted with async it will write to the cache, when the cache is full you see the \"Real\" write speed.\nThe work around seems to be sudo cp /filetobecopied /dev/nameofdevice \nanother posted here says that \"copying in chunks\" works. Unconfirmed on my part.\n\nA: This is also a nice answer with a solution:\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/a/181236\nIt says:\n\nThe reason it happens that way is that the program says \"write this\n  data\" and the linux kernel copies it into a memory buffer that is\n  queued to go to disk, and then says \"ok, done\". So the program thinks\n  it has copied everything. Then the program closes the file, but\n  suddenly the kernel makes it wait while that buffer is pushed out to\n  disk.\nSo, unfortunately the program can't tell you how long it will take to\n  flush the buffer because it doesn't know.\nIf you want to try some power-user tricks, you can reduce the size of\n  the buffer that Linux uses by setting /proc/sys/vm/dirty_bytes to\n  something like 15728640 (15 MB). This means the application can't get\n  more than 15MB ahead of its actual progress.\nA side effect is that your computer might have lower data-writing\n  throughput with this setting, but on the whole, I find it helpful to\n  see that a program is running a long time while it writes lots of data\n  vs. the confusion of having a program appear to be done with its job\n  but the system lagging badly as the kernel does the actual work.\n  Setting dirty_bytes to a reasonably small value can also help prevent\n  your system from becoming unresponsive when you're low on free memory\n  and run a program that suddenly writes lots of data.\nBut, don't set it too small! I use 15MB as a rough estimate that the\n  kernel can flush the buffer to a normal hard drive in 1/4 of a second\n  or less. It keeps my system from feeling \"laggy\".\n\n", "Q: How does one show all applications when choosing an application to open a file with? I am trying to open a file of an unknown type (Pokemon Gold.gbc). I double click it and get the message \"Could not display '/home/josh/Downloads/Pokemon ROMS/Pokemon Gold.gbc'. The file is of an unknown type.\" I click \"Select Application\" and then \"Show Other Applications.\" However, not all of my applications are listed there, and neither is the one that I want (VBA-M [package name vbam-gtk]). How can I get all of my installed applications to show in this menu so that I do not have to open the file from the desired program, I can just launch it by double-clicking the file in nautilus?\nUpdate: I found out that the application can be launched from \n/usr/bin/vbam\n\nor from \n/usr/share/applications/VBA-M\n\nor command line:\ngvbam\n\nAdditional details: I installed this package from a .deb file I got from Sourceforge, not from the repositories (the GameBoy emulator in the repositories is not satisfactory).\nSo is there at least a way that I can select the executable file to open the unknown file with?\nUpdate 2:\nI have tried everything in the first answer below to no avail. As a temporary fix, I have changed the file extension from .gbc to .gb and so far everything seems to be working fine. However, I do not want to stay this way as I do not know if this will cause any problems.\n\nA: Solution:\nIn terminal, run gedit ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list.  In the text document that opens, add the line application/octet-stream=gvbam.desktop; underneath \"[Added Associates]\", which should be at the top.  This should force .gbc files, which Ubuntu recognizes as octet-streams, to open using VBA-M.\nYou will also have to tell VBA-M to load a rom upon launching by using the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*In terminal, run gksudo gedit /usr/share/applications/gvbam.desktop\n\n*In the file that opens, replace Exec=gvbam with Exec=gvbam %U\nFollowing this, you will need to run sudo update-desktop-database in terminal to \"apply\" the edits.\nWhen you click \"Open with other application...\" in the right-click menu, and click \"Show other applications\", VBA-M should now be in the list, and the game should open correctly.\nIf file is not recognized as a GameBoy Color Rom or isn't opening, rename the extension. For example, if the extension is \".gbc\" (i.e. GameBoy Color), renaming it to \".gb\" (i.e. GameBoy) should make it recognized as a GameBoy Rom.\n\nHow I came to my conclusion\nIn terminal, run gksudo gedit /usr/share/applications/gvbam.desktop. In the \"Exec=gvbam\" line, add %U afterwards. So in the end, it should the whole line should be Exec=gvbam %U.\nWhile this did add VBA-M to the \"Other Applications\" list, (and thus allow me to set VBA-M as the default program for .gbc's) the game doesn't actually run; in fact, the VBA-M window completely fails to show up anywhere. I think that this is because of how VBA-M currently works; in a terminal, I ran gvbam \"Pokemon Gold.gbc\", and it threw the following error:\nThe program 'gvbam' received an X Window System error.\nThis probably reflects a bug in the program.\nThe error was 'BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)'.\n  (Details: serial 474 error_code 11 request_code 154 minor_code 3)\n  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;\n   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.\n   To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line\n   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful\n   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)\n\nTo further test this, I downloaded another rom, and I chose The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. Having already done the above instructions to add VBA-M to the application list, I chose it as default for the Zelda game, which was a .gba file; the game loaded fine. I noticed in the properties of the files, the .gbc's type was unknown (application/octet-stream), while the .gba's type was Game Boy Advance ROM (application/x-gba-rom); obviously, something else was missing in the association of GameBoy Color roms, which wasn't missing with GameBoy Advance roms.\nI tried adding gbc as an associated filetype with application/octet-stream, and that seemed to fix the issue of the .gbc file not opening. However, I then removed it, and tried opening the .gbc again, and it still worked; I'm not sure what I did, but now it works.\n\nOriginal Answer\nThis got an upvote, so since someone thought this was good, I'm leaving it here for anyone else who cares. That being said, the information above is probably more relevant to the question.\nTo start out, you must be sure that the MIME type for your file extension does not already exist. Open a terminal and enter:\n\n\n*\n\n*grep 'gbc' /etc/mime.types\nIf there was no output, or the output given did not include your extension, you must add a MIME type.\nIn a terminal, open the mime.types file by running gksudo gedit /etc/mime.types.  In this file, add the following line to the \"application\" section:\n\napplication/gbc                   gbc\n\nThere should be additional spaces between the two gbc's - just make sure to line the second gbc up with the other extensions.  I would show, but I'm not sure how to do this on askubuntu.\n\nSources:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adding Mime Types\n\n*Where are file associations stored?\n\n*How does Ubuntu create “user-defined” file associations?\n", "Q: AWStats icons are not showing / Error 404 Edit: This is the solution should anyone have the same problem\nAfter installing and configuring AWStats from the repository, and following instructions from here\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/AWStats\nit will work fine, except the pictures/icons will not be shown (you will get an Error 404).\nThe proposed configuration of /etc/apache2/sites-available/default is\n\nAlias /awstatsclasses \"/usr/share/awstats/lib/\"\nAlias /awstatsicons/ \"/usr/share/awstats/icon/\"\nAlias /awstatscss \"/usr/share/doc/awstats/examples/css\"\nScriptAlias /awstats/ /usr/lib/cgi-bin/\nOptions ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch\n\nbut the actual URL when I open an image is\nhttp://example.com/awstats-icon/other/awstats_logo6.png\nedit the default file to make this line has a - and no \"s\" after \"icon\":\nAlias /awstatsicons/ to /awstats-icon/\nThen save the file and reload Apache2\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload.\nIcons should not be visible.\n\nA: I found the answer for AWStats under Ubuntu 12.10.

You should pipe it to xclip, as date | xclip to copy it to the X selection (not clipboard). Then you can paste it into your document by middle-clicking. If you want to be able to use Ctrl-V, instead use date | xclip -selection c to copy it to the actual clipboard.\nAnother alternative is to use xdotool to type the date directly into your document. Assign to your shortcut\nxdotool type \"$(date)\"\n\nThen, when you press the shortcut key, it will calculate the current date and type the characters it into your document.\nFor ISO 8601 format, use xdotool type \"$(date --rfc-3339=s)\".\n\nIf it doesn't work: Because these are shell commands (as opposed to executables), you might have to pass the command to bash when specifying them in your shortcut.

It isn't going to integrate with CTAN's. If you want to trick APT into thinking that you have Ubuntu versions of these packages, you have to do that yourself. And it probably won't work perfectly.\nYou can use the equivs package to easily make a package that Provides all of these packages. That should work.\n", "Q: TV Screen disconnect when playing sound over hdmi I just spent hours to configure the sound to work with HDMI.\nMy last problem is, when I start playing sound the TV screen goes on and off, like when you change the resolution. When I stop playing sound, 3-5 seconds after, the same thing happen.\nI feel like everytime I play/stop the sound, the HDMI connection needs to be resetted. Really annoying!\nTo enable the sound over HDMI, I have done : \npactl set-card-profile 0 output:hdmi-stereo\n\nWhich basically set the pulse audio profile to HDMI.\n\nA: Depending on your sound hardware you may also find the appropriate port to where your digital HDMI sound goes. To list ports of cards available issue:\npacmd list-cards\n\nUsually there are several profiles available to adress different ports. These will also be lsited with the command above. Try if selecting another profile gives you the expected results (replace <card-index> and <profile-name> with values read above):\npacmd set-card-profile <card-index> <profile-name>\n\nIf no profiles adressing different ports are available you can also change the port of a given sink with:\npacmd list-sinks  # to read the sink index for the next command\npcmad set-sink-port <sink-index> <port-name>\n\n\nIn case you have a graphical desktop you may also change the card profile with pavucontrol  in the \"Configuration\" tab:\n\nNote that different HDMI-profiles may be listed which all show up having the same name.\n\nIf all that fails you may try to disable HDMI-CEC on your TV set or try with a different HDMI cable as flickering of the screen on your TV set may indicate an erroneous electrical input on the HDMI-ports.\n", "Q: problem with jdk 6 and tomcat 7 I installed tomcat 7 and am using JDK 6\nwhen I start tomcat7 I get this \nsudo service tomcat7 start \n* Starting Tomcat servlet engine tomcat7\nstart-stop-daemon: unable to start /usr/lib/jvm/openjdk-6-jdk/bin/java (No such file or directory)\n                                                                     [ OK ]\n\njava and javac have symlinks in usr/bin.\n\nA: I changed the path of the java file in the tomcat7 file, now the tomcat7 starts fine, but\nwhen I try wget\nwget localhost:8080\n--2013-01-07 16:47:44--  http://localhost:8080/\nResolving localhost (localhost)... 127.0.0.1\nConnecting to localhost (localhost)|127.0.0.1|:8080... connected.\nHTTP request sent, awaiting response... 404 Not Found\n2013-01-07 16:47:44 ERROR 404: Not Found.\n\n", "Q: What are the differences between Mythbuntu and MythTV? I've heard about both, however I've never been able to distinguish how they are distinct, Mythbuntu as I see it is used as a Desktop environment, whereas MythTV seems to be installed on a TV itself with an equivalent App on the Mythbuntu desktop. I may be entirely wrong in making this assumption though. \nI've also heard of Mythbuntu being used as a \"frontend \" with MythTV as a \"backend \" if someone could clarify this concept I'd be quite grateful as for me I thought MythTV also qualified as a \"frontend\". \nIn short: \n\n\n*\n\n*How are Mythbuntu and MythTV related and what are their major differences? \n\n*What are the definitions of a frontend and backend in the case of Mythbuntu and MythTV? \n\n*Is Mythbuntu required for MythTV to work?\n\n\nI've already read the following questions but I've got very basic knowledge on this issue and none really explain things in an Average Joe-esque way for users with little knowledge on the subject.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I connect a MythTV frontend to a MythTV backend on Mythbuntu 11.10?\n\n*How do I Install MythTV on a Lenovo S12 with wireless?\n\n*Mythmote wont connect to mythbuntu 12.04, seems frontend is not listening on all interfaces\n\nA: \nHow are Mythbuntu and MythTV related and what are their major differences?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Mythbuntu is the official operating system based on Ubuntu.\n\n*MythTV is software that acts like a PVR (personal video recording) system. It is not limited to Ubuntu but can be used on Fedora called MythDora. \n\n\n\nWhat are the definitions of a frontend and backend in the case of Mythbuntu and MythTV?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The front end is the software required for the visual elements (GUI) and is used to find, play, and manipulate media files. The back end is the server where the media files, tuners, and database are actually stored.\n\n\n\nIs Mythbuntu required for MythTV to work?\n\n\n\n*\n\n*No. You can also use other Linux based systems like Fedora and also Windows or Mac OS.\n\n", "Q: How do I get a list of non-LTS packages installed efficiently? I'd like to see to what extent my system is LTS-supported by means of what packages are supported for 5 years and which are not. I could disregard some non-5yr-supported packages, as some are rarely used or very unlikely to get into (security) issues.\nI think this is useful as one can get a report and draw a conclusion, e.g. \"my system is 100% LTS\", \"due to packages X,Y,Z, my system is just 99% LTS\", \"due to the use of KDE, my system is now 50% LTS\".\nAs related to my answer in the question Does 12.04 LXDE have LTS?, I posted a way to see which packages of Ubuntu feature five years of support. E.g.:\n$ apt-cache show unity | grep ^Supported\nSupported: 5y\n\n$ apt-cache show lxde-core | grep ^Supported\n<no output>\n\nI could write a script to get all information for all the packages, however, the apt-cache commands are horribly slow:\nreal    0m1.535s\nuser    0m1.484s\nsys     0m0.036s\n\nWith 2700+ packages installed, this would take roughly 70 minutes (!).\nHow can I speed up things and get a report for all non-5yr-supported packages on my system?\nI'd prefer a simple apt-* shell command for the use in a simple shell script. If it would require more advanced scripting like going into Python, this is fine too. Eventually, I would like to release a (small) script to create a report on a system easily and quickly.\nNote: I'm not interested in the discussion about whether or not a specific flavour of Ubuntu provides LTS or not - this is really just packages. You can just mix LTS and non-LTS packages on a system.\n\nA: I don't know about your system, but this is what I did:\ntime dpkg -l | grep 'ii' |  awk ' {print $2}' | xargs apt-cache show | grep '^Supported:' | grep -v '5y' | wc -l\n158\n\nreal        0m27.549s\nuser        0m5.580s\nsys         0m21.701s\n\ndoesn't seem so bad right?\nThe total number of packages:\ndpkg -l | grep 'ii' | wc -l\n2602\n\nI am running a AMD E-350 which isn't exactly a blazing fast cpu...\nEdit: maximum number of arguments to xargs:\nxargs --show-limits\n\n...\nPOSIX upper limit on argument length (this system): 2091826\n...\n\n\nA: Here's a quick one-liner to get you the list of packages which are maintained for LESS than the full LTS period of 5 years, using grep-dctrl(1):\nsudo apt-get install dctrl-tools\ndpkg -l | grep '^ii' |  awk ' {print $2}' | xargs apt-cache show | grep-dctrl -v -FSupported --exact-match -nsPackage 5y | sort | uniq\n\nYou can easily modify it to look for different support periods.\n", "Q: How do I remap the search button on my Logitech MX400? I have a logitech MX400 wireless. It has a search button I would like to use for pasting (instead of the extremely sensitive but hard to press scroll wheel).

It seems that the search button is intercepted at a level below the X events. Any ideas? I have ubuntu 12.04. Ubuntu actually sees the click and spawns a search dialog, but there's no trace of a click event in the xev. \nEdit\nI checked the method provided with xmodmap. My .Xmodmap now contains the following line\nkeycode 225 = XF86Paste NoSymbol XF86Paste``\n\nrunning xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap now disables the button altogether (or at least, I don't get any result by pressing it). I tried xmodmap -pke and it prints out:\nkeycode 225 = XF86Paste NoSymbol XF86Paste NoSymbol XF86Paste\nStrange enough. All the other entries are similarly formatted.

Install xdotool via terminal (CTRL+ALT+T):\nsudo apt-get install xdotool\n\nor use  the Software Center .\n2. Create a script that uses xdotool to emulate the key down events of CTRL and v. In the terminal:\nmkdir -p ~/bin  \ngedit ~/bin/fakepaste\n\nCopy the following content into the editor window that opened up. After copying the code save, then close it:\n#!/bin/sh\nexec /usr/bin/xdotool key CTRL+V  \nEOF\n\nNow make the script executable:\nchmod +x ~/bin/fakepaste\n\n3. Log out and log in to reload your PATH.\n4. Create the custom shortcut \nGo to System Settings, then go to Keyboard, then Shortcuts.  \nPress the + button at the bottom of the dialog. Provide a name for the shortcut you're about to create and for the command fill in: fakepaste. Press OK.\nNext to your new shortcut you will see disabled. Click on that text and then press the key you want to be assigned to your keyboard emulation.\nYou should now be able to use your search key for pasting!\n\nA: xbindkeys solution with xdotool\nFor this solution you will need xbindkeys and xdotool\nKill xbindkeys and dump your button configuration\nkillall xbindkeys\n\nand\nxbindkeys --defaults >> ~/.xbindkeysrc\n\nAdd your new bindings\nNow you can modify this file to add custom bindings, these have the form\n\"<command>\"\n  <key combination>\n\nso if you add\n\"gedit\"\n  m:0x0 +b:4\n\nyou will open gedit every time you scroll up.\nSo now you can try one of the following, pick the one that works best for you. In all case xdotool click 2 will  be emulated, this is the middle mouse button press, and this will paste both in- and outside terminals.\n\n\n*\n\n*intercept the 225 from your mouse:\n\"xdotool click 2\"\n  m:0x0 +b:225\n\n\n*intercept keycode 225 in general:\n\"xdotool click 2\"\n  c:225\n\n\n*replace all XF86Search events (revert your mouse settings to the original settings first, so that you get the XF86Search back):\n\"xdotool click 2\"\n  XF86Search\n\nStart xbindkeys and test\nRun\nxbindkeys\n\nand see if it works.\n", "Q: Can I use the Launchpad translation service for my GitHub project?

(Instructions can be found here.)\n\n*Set up Launchpad to automatically import from Github.

Every so often Ubuntu detects an internal error that it reports with a dialog box that looks something like this:\n\nIf I \"Send an error report to help fix this problem\" (via the checkbox), where do the error reports go?  I imagine this gets entered into a bug tracker somewhere, but which one?  Can I \"watch\" this bug, to get notification when it is fixed?\n\nA: All the errors from apport (which is the one reporting that the error occurred), will be stored in the /var/crash directory with the name of the process, PID, and other relevant information of the crash. When you send them using the tickbox, they are sent to Lauchpad (pre-release) or Ubuntu Error Tracker. This can be seen in the wiki page:\n\nIf you choose to send an error report, the alert should disappear immediately. Data should be collected (if it hasn’t been already), and reports should be sent in the background, with no progress or success/failure feedback. If you are not connected to the Internet at the time, reports should be queued. Any queued reports should be sent when you next agree to send an error report while online. \n\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcuts do not work after reboot In my Ubuntu 12.04 installation the media keyboard shortcuts do not work after reboot.

Clementine is configured to use the Gnome shortcuts.\n\nA: Explain the issue\nI haven't got a clue how this happened. I have a problem where the Commands information in CCSM is forgotten after rebooting, but that seems unrelated to what you have (I can fix this by setting the shortcuts through the Keyboard menu, what you refer to as \"global Gnome keyboard configuration\"). As stated in my comment, what you're trying to do works perfectly well on my system.\nWorkaround\nThe problem can be in the Keyboard shortcuts settings (the one that sets the command) or in the specific multimedia commands (the command that is executed). In this workaround I'll explain how to do both at the same time. The programme that sets the shortcuts doesn't know the actual shortcut to change the multimedia stuff and neither do I, so this will be the easier solution.\nYou could set the shortcuts in another way. \nFor this I know one way, you can try the Commands plugin in CompizConfig Settings Manager, CCSM. If memory serves me right, this plugin works well for 12.04. CCSM is in the repositories, so simply install it from the Software Centre. If you don't know it, be careful with this tool. It is an awesome little programme but it is very easy to mess up your system. There are other ways, possibly through gconf-editor, Google around a bit for that if you're interested.\nIn the alternative keyboard shortcuts manager you can enter a command to change the volume. I do not know which nifty command is used in Unity to show the notification with the current volume, so we'll have to stick with something old-fashioned: amixer.\nI found a command to increase the volume with amixer at https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/21089/how-to-use-command-line-to-change-volume:\namixer set Master 10%+\n\nand \namixer set Master 10%-\n\nIf you bind these in the Commands plugin and assign a shortcut key you should be good to go.\n\nDon't forget to enable the plugin on the left hand side if you haven't already. Let me know if this solves your issue or if something is unclear.\nEdit: if you struggle with this problem as well, be sure to look at the OP's comment below, it might point you in the right direction\n", "Q: How to put /opt and /home on the same partition but different from /? I'd like to install Ubuntu on two drives, one with / and the other with /opt and /home. But I do not want /opt and /home to reside on separate partitions but on the same one. Is it possible to do during the installation?\n\nA: It's pretty easy with bind mounts.  That way, you can mount a subdirectory from one location on another location.\nJust make \"opt\" a subdirectory in your \"home\" partition, then mount the partition to /home and bind mount /home/opt to /opt:\nsudo mount /dev/sda4 /home\nsudo mount --bind /home/opt /opt\n\nOr it can be made permanent by adding them to /etc/fstab like this:\n/dev/sda4   /home   ext4   defaults   0 2\n/home/opt   /opt    none   bind       0 0\n\nAnd if you prefer using UUIDs, replace /dev/sda4 with UUID=<your UUID>\n\nA: This is what I would do. Make a home partition, tell the installer to mount it to /home. After install and on first boot create a directory called /home/opt. Then mount bind it to /opt. \nMake sure /opt is empty before you do this. I would think so if it's just after a fresh install.\nmount -o bind /home/opt /opt\n\nfor a manual mount.\nFor mounting on boot, edit /etc/fstab it would look something like this. Make sure you add below your home mount, which the installer should have added.\n/home/opt /opt none bind 0 0\n\n\nA: The LVM way\nIf you don't mind it being two different volumes, on one partition.\nCreate an Physical Volume on the drive you want to put the /home and /opt on. Create a Volume Group with just this partition as the single member of it. Give it a name, e.g. myvg. Then create two Logical Volumes, e.g. homes and opt, both will have a filesystem and the obvious mount points.\nAdvantages:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can do snapshotting.\n\n*Resizing Logical Volumes is a piece of cake compared to resizing partitions.\n\n*Create more volumes without even touching the partition table on a running system.\n\n\nIn order to profit from this, you'll have to keep some free space in the Volume Group.\nHow?\nThe installer will allow you to do this quite easily in the GUI. For 12.04 you'll need the alternative image, for 12.10 and onwards, this is included in the regular images.\n", "Q: Turning down wireless button turns down external usb wireless.

The way to do it is to use root's crontab, not your user crontab. A sudo before the usual crontab command does that:\nsudo crontab -e\n\nTip: You can switch the shell's standard editor for things like crontab and visudo with sudo update-alternatives --config editor and then select the editor of your choice.\nEditing the crontab you should add the following line to your file:\n# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)\n# \n# m h  dom mon dow   command  \n\n@daily root /sbin/shutdown -r now\n\nOne has to remove \"root\" if you edited with the command: sudo crontab -e.\nThe \"@daily\" here is a shortcut for every day at midnight (equivalent to \"0 0 * * *\").

What is the fastest / most responsive image viewer?\nI'm looking for a program that is responsive and opens large .jpgs fast - progressively and/or by cleverly loading only parts it will render. A 6 MB picture has a resolution of 4000x3000, while my eeePC only has 1024x600, so I won't see a lot of the pixels anyway. Another technique is to cache pictures in the background while I'm viewing the first. A lot of programs on Windows do stuff like that, is there anything you can recommend for an eeePC running Ubuntu?\nContext: I recently switched to XFCE to revive my eeePC (as Gnome Shell and Unity are somewhat slow on it). I'm generally satisfied as it runs pretty snappy, and I can get work done on the go. However, I'd like to organize some fotos that I have, and all the image viewers I tried are too slow. For example, Ristretto, XFCE's lean image viewer, takes about a second to open a picture of 1.8 MB (5 seconds for a 6 MB picture), and freezes in that time.\n\nA: GPicView\nI'll recommend to you this Simple and Fast image viewer.\nAs you say that you computer is not a super fast calculator you should look for software with a few functions (the fewest possible), and this software meets this requirement, see the next screen-shoot and you will notice it.\n\nYou can install it through the Software-Center.\n\nA: Mcomix actually not a traditional \"image\" viewer but a comic reader but since it preloads all pictures in a folder/zip/rar/whatever it is instant when switching pictures (turing a page) + there is a small preview  on the side where one can see which pictures are already preloaded\n\nA: For sheer speed, feh is the most responsive image viewer you'll ever come across; it might take a bit of getting used to as it is managed from the command line. However, you can add various feh commands as custom actions to filemanagers such as Nautilus and Thunar so that you can activate feh via the context menu when browsing your files.\nOn the man page it is noted that:\n\nFeh is a mode-based image viewer.  It is especially aimed at commandline users who need a fast image viewer without huge GUI dependencies, though it can also be started by (graphical) file managers to view an image. It supports filelists, various image sorting modes, image captions and more... Configurable keyboard shortcuts are used to control it.\n\nSome examples of usage:\nFeh operates in various modes such as slideshow, montage, index, and thumbnail, although you can of course view pictures individually, and also save the results of the index or thumbnail viewing to file. \nAll the following examples assume you use terminal to cd to the folder containing the pictures first:\n1) To start a fullscreen slideshow, and for it to display all the loadable pictures in the folder with a 3 second gap and then exit, you could run: \nfeh -F -D 3 --cycle-once *\n\nYou can use your mouse scrollwheel to flick back and forth through the pictures while the slideshow is running. Even with high resolution pictures (5-6 mb each), you can flick through the pictures incredibly quickly.\nYou could also add this command, with slight modification, as a 'custom' action, context menu item in a file manager such as Thunar (feh -F -D 3 --cycle-once %F): see my answer here regarding Thunar custom actions.\nNote: when not running in fullscreen mode (-F), you may need to supply the --scale-down command switch so the pictures fill your desktop, but not display at their actual size (which could be 4000x3000 and would not fit the screen).\nfeh --scale-down picture.jpg\n\nHence your custom 'open-with' command/launcher should use this --scale-down option, for the times you want to view individual pictures.\n2) In the case of creating an index print and saving to file you could use the following command:\nfeh -I --preload -o index.png\n\n3) You can also use the thumbnail option (-t), which is like the previous command, but allows you to click the thumbnails from the created file:\nfeh -t --preload --scale-down -o thumbprint.png\n\nYou can do a lot more with feh and there are many more options to experiment with, so for more information, please see man feh and the Ubuntu manpages online.\n\nA: Viewnior\nViewnior has been the fastest image viewer for me by far:\n\nOne more reason to choose Viewnior is that isn't affected by this image scaling bug that's prevalent in many other GTK-based image viewers (see here for other solutions to this bug).\n\nInstallation\nUbuntu 14.10 and up\nAs of Ubuntu 14.10 Viewnior is now part of the official Ubuntu repositories. You can install it from the Software Centre or by running the following command:\nsudo apt-get install viewnior\n\nEarlier Ubuntu releases\nA third-party PPA for Viewnior is now available. Before proceeding with the installation please make sure to read the following Q&As on PPAs and their potential dangers:\n\n\n*\n\n*What are PPAs and how do I use them?\n\n*Are PPA's safe to add to my system and what are some \"red flags\" to watch out for?\nIf you are confident with adding a third-party PPA you can install Viewnior by using the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:desdelinux/viewnior\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install viewnior\n\nSource: http://blog.desdelinux.net/instala-viewnior-en-ubuntu-12-04-13-10-14-04-ppa/\n\nAlternatively you can compile Viewnior from source:\ngit clone https://github.com/xsisqox/Viewnior.git\ncd Viewnior\n./autogen.sh\n./configure\nmake\nsudo apt-get install checkinstall\nsudo checkinstall\n\nInstead of using checkinstall to generate a debian package and install it via the package manager you can just as well run make install.

On cheap or buggy motherboards this leaves the ram that would otherwise have those addresses inaccessible.

I'm setting up my first Launchpad project.\nIn this case I would like to import from the Master branch from my GitHub project - the default branch is not Master - it is a release branch currently called \"Release-0.6\"\nOn Launchpad I have set up to automatically import:\n\nAs you can see, the import failed - the error log states:\n\n2013-01-07 14:45:11 INFO    Starting job.\n2013-01-07 14:45:11 INFO    Getting exising bzr branch from central store.\n2013-01-07 14:45:14 INFO    [chan bzr SocketAsChannelAdapter] Opened sftp connection (server version 3)\n2013-01-07 14:45:17 INFO    [chan bzr SocketAsChannelAdapter] Opened sftp connection (server version 3)\n2013-01-07 14:45:17 INFO    291 bytes transferred\n2013-01-07 14:45:18 INFO    No branch found at remote location.\n\nThis is strange since my GitHub project is obviously at the correct web-location.\nThus - what have I done wrong in my configuration?\ni.e. how should I have set up my Launchpad project to import from Github?\n\nA: You need to use the \"read-only git location\" as shown on github. It is the same as the web URL (which you have used), but with .git appended to the end. You need to add this to the end of your URL.\nTo import a non-master branch, you must also append ,branch=branchname to the end of the URL.\nAlso, I think you may be confusing the term \"master branch\" with \"branch named master\" in this case. For your project, pulling https://github.com/fossfreedom/coverart-browser.git will give the contents of what you are calling release-0.6. I think omitting the ,branch=name piece will give what you want. However, when trying to branch your repository in bzr, I get the following error:\n\nbzr: ERROR: Unknown extra fields in <Commit 3f47f3ed4e9e6f15a6c5229bf36d061ae4d86605>: ['gpgsig', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', ''].\n\nThis may cause importing to fail on Launchpad as well.\n\nA: Launchpad supports importing git code directly since 16-10-2016, see the doc for setup instructions.\nA note: if 1084403 bug still open when you're reading this, don't forget to clean your bzr import settings from old setup or you couldn't set a recipe for git code even if it's there.\n\nA: A workaround for the unsupported ,branch=branchname is to create a fork on github first with with the default branch set to the branch you want to import.\n", "Q: How to define completely new xdg-user-dirs? I've just configured my ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs file under unity (ubtuntu 12.10) and everything works well so far. But is there any chance to extend the user dirs like this:\nXDG_UBUNTUONE_DIR=\"$HOME/Ubuntu One\"\nXDG_DROPBOX_DIR=\"$HOME/Dropbox\"\nXDG_TEMPORARY_DIR=\"/media/SYSTEMDATA/Temporary Data\"\n\nAs you can see I want to define completely new entries. How can I define them and e.g. specify icons for those new entries?\nTHX BKS\n\nA: You can add the lines you suggested, but it won't have any effect. Software needs to be programmed to read those environment variables, and I doubt that Ubuntu One reads XDG_UBUNTUONE_DIR, or that Dropbox reads XDG_DROPBOX_DIR.\nYou can, however, specify icons for folders using Nautilus. This used to be a built-in feature of Nautilus, but for the newer versions, you have to install an add-on.

I have completely uninstalled the gnome-shell using this as a guide: Remove Gnome Shell completely after installing it? . I then reinstalled it and the problem was still there. Then I took a look at a fresh install of 12.10 and the same problem was there as well. Then I took a look at a fresh install of 12.04 and the problem wasn't there. The option to add application switching was there and I was able to enable it. I have no idea why that option is not in 12.10.\n\nA: Alright I finally got it. On ubuntu 12.10 there are a few plug-ins missing in compiz. So you have to install compiz-plugins-extra:\nsudo apt-get install compiz-plugins-extra\n\nvoila the options appears.

and press Enter.\n\nA: I think it is important to note on this older post that MySQL has changed some things in the past 5 years. Digital Ocean states the following in their tutorial called How To Install MySQL on Ubuntu 18.04:\n\nIn Ubuntu systems running MySQL 5.7 (and later versions), the root MySQL user is set to authenticate using the auth_socket plugin by default rather than with a password.\n\nTherefore, run the following to install properly and securely:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install mysql-server\nsudo mysql_secure_installation\n\nI personally answered y for every prompt from the mysql_secure_installation and created a strong password (option 2, if you set up the VALIDATE PASSWORD plugin). However, the particular choices here are your's to make. Either way, you will set a password under one of these prompts. Although, as you will see, you won't necessarily need the password.\nAfter the prompts for mysql_secure_installation are complete. All you have to do is type the following to log in:\nsudo mysql\n\nThis is because the native authentication method for MySQL 5.7 and later is auth_socket instead of mysql_native_password for better security. No need for a password, because you can only log in from the machine it's installed on. \nIf you need to use a password to log in from another source, or want to know more, I recommend reading How To Install MySQL on Ubuntu 18.04 in its entirety.\n", "Q: Add Ubuntu live to another ubuntu+windows system I've got Win7 in a ntfs-partition and lubuntu 12.10 in another one. \n    **sudo fdisk -l**\n    Disco /dev/sda: 160.0 GB, 160041885696 bytes\n255 cabezas, 63 sectores/pista, 19457 cilindros, 312581808 sectores en total\nUnidades = sectores de 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nTamaño de sector (lógico / físico): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nTamaño E/S (mínimo/óptimo): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nIdentificador del disco: 0x000c119a\n\nDispositivo Inicio    Comienzo      Fin      Bloques  Id  Sistema\n/dev/sda1   *        2048      206847      102400    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda2          206848   230688767   115240960    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda3       230688768   266340351    17825792    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda4       266342398   312581429    23119516    f  W95 Ext'd (LBA)\n/dev/sda5       301644014   307068299     2712143    b  W95 FAT32\n/dev/sda6       307068314   312581429     2756558    b  W95 FAT32\n/dev/sda7       266342400   295784447    14721024   83  Linux\n/dev/sda8       295786496   301643775     2928640   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\nLas entradas de la tabla de particiones no están en el orden del disco\n\nBefore I got Lubuntu I used to create a small partition and with EasyBCD (windows) I used to load a small Linux ISO as live.\nNow I'm wondering if I do that in Windows (considering I already modified my grub since I've got Lubunto installing) will I destroy or have problems?\nI would like to install this linux-live in sda5.

I have a 2011 Macbook Pro, and when I'm typing my palms cover the upper corners of the touchpad, and frequently touch at the same time.  It seems palm detection isn't working, or possibly a small enough portion of my palm touches the corner so that it registers as a finger. At any rate, I frequently get a two-finger scroll action occurring as a result of this, which can lead to some very annoying results while typing text.\nIt seems to me that a two-finger scroll should only be registered if the fingers are somewhat close together, not at opposite sides of the pad. Is there a setting for the synaptics driver that I can change this behavior?\n\nA: I don't know about adjusting the two-finger-scrolling width, but you open \"System Settings\" and go to \"Mouse and Touchpad\" you can set it to turn the touchpad off when you type and adjust the sensitivity.  \n\n\nA: You could try xinput\nFirst in a terminal type xinput list and note the id of your touchpad.\nThen type xinput set-prop x \"Synaptics Palm Detection\" 1, where x is the id of your touchpad.

Because that isn't what you are supposed to do.\nYou have to burn the iso onto the disc, otherwise it is unbootable.\n\nA: yes is wipe your disk but you can select side-by-side installation option to.\nSome time it might be DVD drive problem you can try installation using bootable USB drive http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows \nor mac http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx\n\nA: You can't just copy the iso to the DVD, you have to burn the iso (disk image) to the DVD.  In Windows if you double click on the ISO file it will normally open Nero or whatever burning software you have and prompt you to insert a DVD ready for burning.  Change the burn parameters to the slowest possible speed for the best chance of making a reliable boot disk.\nMore information in the documentation here.  Note the section on checking the md5sum of the iso before burning.  This can save you a lot of time and frustration if you got a corrupted download the first time.\n", "Q: why phpmyadmin didn't work?

You'll just have them idle until they are put back into a window manager (Compiz in your case). \nSo yes it is safe to kill and restart compiz\n\nA: It is perfectly fine to kill (-9) compiz. It will just restart compiz, and all your applications will go to the first work space.

It gave me the inet address as 192.168.0.3.\nSo, this should be the address through which I should be able to access the server right? \nBut I am not able to access it via browser.. server is up on VirtualBox all the time-- but still, its not working on other browsers, or my mobile.\nWhat do I have to do to make it accessible to the public?\n\nA: By default a guest machine in VirtualBox is configured to use so called NAT networking - the guest's network adapter's IP is in a \"virtual\" subnet which includes the guest and the parent VirtualBox application which acts as a gateway. For the guest it looks like it accessing internet via something like an ordinary DSL modem, but the guest can't be accessed from anywhere, just like you can't access machines in your local network from Internet without specifically configuring your modem to allow such access.\nVirtualBox documentation has the following list of networking modes:\n\nEach of the eight networking adapters can be separately configured to\n  operate in one of the following modes:\nNot attached\nIn this mode, VirtualBox reports to the guest that a network card is\n  present, but that there is no connection -- as if no Ethernet cable\n  was plugged into the card. This way it is possible to \"pull\" the\n  virtual Ethernet cable and disrupt the connection, which can be useful\n  to inform a guest operating system that no network connection is\n  available and enforce a reconfiguration.\nNetwork Address Translation (NAT)\nIf all you want is to browse the Web, download files and view e-mail\n  inside the guest, then this default mode should be sufficient for you,\n  and you can safely skip the rest of this section. Please note that\n  there are certain limitations when using Windows file sharing (see the\n  section called “NAT limitations” for details).\nBridged networking\nThis is for more advanced networking needs such as network simulations\n  and running servers in a guest. When enabled, VirtualBox connects to\n  one of your installed network cards and exchanges network packets\n  directly, circumventing your host operating system's network stack.\nInternal networking\nThis can be used to create a different kind of software-based network\n  which is visible to selected virtual machines, but not to applications\n  running on the host or to the outside world.\nHost-only networking\nThis can be used to create a network containing the host and a set of\n  virtual machines, without the need for the host's physical network\n  interface. Instead, a virtual network interface (similar to a loopback\n  interface) is created on the host, providing connectivity among\n  virtual machines and the host.\nGeneric networking\nRarely used modes share the same generic network interface, by\n  allowing the user to select a driver which can be included with\n  VirtualBox or be distributed in an extension pack.\n\nIf you need to access your guest from outside, you need to configure bridged networking, which will give your guest its own IP in your local network. The configuration is done in VirtualBox settings, not in the guest OS.\nTo be able to access the server from your mobile (i.e. from outside of your LAN), after configuring the networking you additionally will need to set up port forwarding on your DSL modem.\n\nA: To provide a little more information, these are the actual steps to take to setup a bridged network:\n\nTo enable bridged networking, all you need to do is to open the\n  Settings dialog of a virtual machine, go to the \"Network\" page and\n  select \"Bridged network\" in the drop down list for the \"Attached to\"\n  field. Finally, select desired host interface from the list at the\n  bottom of the page, which contains the physical network interfaces of\n  your systems. On a typical MacBook, for example, this will allow you\n  to select between \"en1: AirPort\" (which is the wireless interface) and\n  \"en0: Ethernet\", which represents the interface with a network cable.\n\nSource\nI then restarted the virtual machine and was able to connect to it externally.\n", "Q: Weak wifi signal on Lenovo g series I've just installed Ubuntu 12.10 on my Lenovo laptop and the wifi signal reception changed completely.\nI had Windows installed on it first and it had no problem connecting to my home network from my bedroom (to a router in another room).

It's completely unselectable, so I end up not being able to connect to the wifi.\nI also tried to select the CA before trying to connect, but what happens then is that the prompt appears while the system starts connecting to the wifi. Unfortunately, it fails to do so.\nIf you know a way to connect to a wifi with such configuration, I'm also happy with that. The used CA would be the Entrust.net Secure Server Certificate Authority.\n\nA: I just had the same issue. I was able to resolve it by logging out, switching to Unity, and connecting to the network there. I think it had something to do with Gnome 3 desktop not being as integrated. I think it only lets you manage one \"pop up menu\" at a time. In Unity, it doesn't open the Network Settings in the background, so you can click Ignore or you can choose a CA.\nIf you don't have Unity even installed, I suppose you could also try to do it from the command line using the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a wpa_supplicant.conf file. This seems to be a relatively good guide for how to create your configuration file, and I am drawing from it for the rest of the instructions. Your configuration file should look something like this:\nnetwork = {\n\nssid=\"Your_ssid_here\"\nkey_mgmt=WPA-EAP\npairwise=TKIP\ngroup=TKIP\neap=PEAP\nidentity=\"user@your_domain\"\npassword=\"your_password\"\nca_cert=\"/path/to/cert\"\nphase1=\"peapver=0\"\nphase2=\"MSCHAPV2\"\n}\n\n\n*Then, you must start issue the following command:\nwpa_supplicant -B -c/path/to/wpa_supplicant.conf -iwlan0\n\nThe \"-B\" flag makes the daemon run in the background. The \"-c\" followed by the path     loads the config file you created earlier, and the \"-iwlan0\" should be replaced with your wireless interface. \n\n*If you want to keep this after a reboot, add the following to your /etc/network/interfaces file. \nauto wlan0\niface wlan0 inet dhcp\npre-up wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf\npost-down killall -q wpa_supplicant\n\nHope this helps!

You can use it like this: sleep <SECONDS>s.\nTo set the title of the terminal from within a script, use:\nNAME=\"NEW_TITLE\"; echo -en \"\\033]0;$NAME\\a\"\n\nSee this answer for more information.\nFor example, here is a little script to open a program in the background:\nNAME=\"Opening program...\"; echo -en \"\\033]0;$NAME\\a\"\n$1&\nsleep 0.75s\nwmctrl -a \"Opening program\"\n\n", "Q: Package combined C++/Python software I would like to package a software that contains both C++ and Python code.

However, it may be very useful for a good site like askubuntu.\nNote: This method below merely edits the install file so it can be installed in the latest firefox, as xpi files are basically like zip archives, which can be manipulated. \nThe developer did not test it with Firefox 17, so it is unsupported, but it does seem to work. However, it will not be updated again and will receive no updates or fixes, so you must only use it on trusted sites like askubuntu.\nHow to edit the xpi and install it\n(After writing this article myself, I noticed that a similar method for another addon was also used in this question, so the basics of the trick documented below is well known and usually works fine.)\nDownload the xpi file from gnome's archive:\nwget \"http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/mozilla.org/addons/9738/terminalrun-0.6-fx-linux.xpi\"\nunzip -d terminalrun terminalrun-0.6-fx-linux.xpi\ncd terminalrun\ngedit install.rdf\n\nNow, just edit the Firefox version numbers in install.rdf so they look like this- choose any version of Firefox from 17 onwards to put in the MaxVersion (I chose an arbitrary number like 23.0, but you can choose a much higher one, up to 99.0.)\n<em:minVersion>3.0</em:minVersion>\n        <em:maxVersion>23.0.*</em:maxVersion>\n\nAfter saving the file, but while still in the terminalrun folder, run\nzip -r terminalrun *\nmv terminalrun.zip terminalrun.xpi\n\nNow just drag the xpi file into Firefox and it will install it; restart firefox and you will be able to highlight code with your mouse and right click to open in terminal.\nUsually when you highlight code it works fine (as long as the command you highlight makes sense for your system), so please test this one that gives you system information:\nuname -a\n\nHere's the firefox context menu that you should see:\n\n", "Q: Lugaru game doesn't go full screen in 12.10 When you try to go full screen for full resolution, the task panel and the unity bar stay in place.

I read a guide somewhere, but didn't follow it for some reason i forgot.\n\nA: I don't believe /usr/lib/cups/filter//usr/local/lexmark/v3/bin/printfilter is intended as one directory - /usr/lib/cups/filter/ typically has no subdirs.\nBut apparently you managed to install the desired package and now you're getting the new insecure permissions error.

Although this method can assess alternative.\nFirst of all you need to install the davfs2 package. You can do this by issuing the following command in terminal: (or you can also use your favorite package manager to install WebDAV)\nsudo apt-get install davfs2 \nsudo adduser username davfs2\n\nNow you should create a dedicated box.com folder.\nmkdir /home/username/box.com\necho \"https://dav.box.com/dav /home/username/box.com davfs rw,user,noauto 0 0\" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab\nsudo chmod u+s /usr/sbin/mount.davfs\n\nNow you have to switch to a regular system user. This can be accomplished by issuing the following command:\nsu username\n\nNext you should disable the file locks in your davfs2 configuration file, insert your box e-mail and password, change the privileges to the secrets file containing your credentials and finally to mount your account:\necho \"use_locks 0\" > ~/.davfs2/davfs2.conf   \n\nIf this command gives you \"No such file or folder\" error, just create the folder and file with the command below\nmkdir ~/.davfs2/\ntouch  ~/.davfs2/davfs2.conf\n\nthen proceed with these commands.\nread -p \"box.com email: \" boxuser\nread -sp \"box.com password: \" boxpass\necho \"https://dav.box.com/dav $boxuser $boxpass\" > ~/.davfs2/secrets \nchmod 600 ~/.davfs2/secrets\nmount /home/username/box.com\n\nInitially it may take some time in order to synchronize all of the files in your box with the newly created folder but after that you should be able to create, delete and overwrite all of your files.\n\nA: The best solution I have found is webdav-sync: http://www.re.be/webdav_sync/index.xhtml\nThis is a Java program that offers bidirectional offline syncing with Box (and other WebDAV folders). \nThe only problem I have encountered is that it may choke on files/directories with non-English characters. \nA command like java -Dbe.re.http.no-expect100 -jar ~/.local/bin/webdav_sync1_1_9.jar -r -u https://username:password@URL -d ~/Box-sync/ -bi -i 30 should do the trick.\n", "Q: How I can access my software from Ubuntu?

There are ways to access your files on your Windows partition, but that's a very common question here. I've gathered some questions you might be interested in reading below!\nYou can't start applications you've already installed in Windows - Ubuntu is not even like Windows. You'll have to find alternatives to those unavailable in Ubuntu the regular way. For example, Chrome is provided for Ubuntu by Google, while most other applications are available in Software Center (start here, not on the net!).\nI suggest to search there application by their function, rather than the name you're used to in Windows. E.g. search for \"photo editor\" rather than \"Photoshop\", or \"text editor\" rather than \"Notepad\". The Software Center also provides a rating other users have given this piece of software, similar to how the Google Play store works.

I did this so the Windows 8 boot loader wouldn't be overwritten in case I ever wanted to remove Ubuntu. I can still boot into Ubuntu if I select the boot loader from the BIOS.\nI want to add Ubuntu to the Windows 8 boot loader and I've been told to use EasyBCD. The issue with that is it doesn't actually direct Windows to the GRUB file, but rather to something like autogrub0.mri. I have found another programme called Visual BCD which will allow me to actually set the bootloader paths and drives.\nFrom here, I don't quite know what to do. I believe I have it set to the correct drive but I don't know if I'm directing to the  right file. I think it's /boot/grub/x86_64-efi/grub.efi. I don't know if that's the right file, if I need to remove /boot or if the / need to be \\ as that's what Windows uses.\nSorry for such a lengthy post, please help!\n\nA: Are you using UEFI and Secure Boot?  I'm going to assume you are since you are picking a UEFI file.  I also would recommend disabling secure boot while you at least try to get it to work.  Re-enable it when done and re-test.\nI'm assuming you are running a 64 bit Windows 8, and therefore must use a 64-bit Boot Loader per the UEFI standard, and then you must be running 64-Bit version of Ubuntu.  If you are not, then you have to disable UEFI.  I would recommend just re-installing with the 64 bit version.  \nTo answer your question:\nIf you are using 64 bit Ubuntu the file I believe you should use would be located in \n/boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi\nIf you are using secure boot I think you will need to launch this file since it's signed:\n/boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/shimx64.efi\nIf you are using 32-bit Ubuntu you must disable UEFI\nSo, here is a link about EasyBCD, looks like you must need 2.2 to have EFI support\nhttps://neosmart.net/forums/showthread.php?t=9342\nYou would probably want to look for threads about GRUB using the last loaded and set it to zero time if you are using Windows the boot loader so you never see it if you pick Ubuntu.\nI'm going to agree with the other answer, I highly recommend running GRUB as your boot loader.  It works great, it detects the Windows .efi files and launches them (Not in secure boot though this is bug #1091464).  I would be surprised if EasyBCD allows you to boot all OS's in SecureBoot.  I use Grub Customizer to delete unneeded entries, give it a background, and reduce the timer.  It's just far more customizable and has a lot of support and history.\n\nA: Hopefully you have figured something else out by now.\nBut just wanted to suggest that you not use the windows boot-loader, as it is incredibly fickle when it comes to recognizing Linux partitions. I've had it working fine, then had it go missing again after windows updated and I've also had it keep Ubuntu listed, but fail to actually boot to it both after upgrading Ubuntu versions and reinstalling Ubuntu. \nInstead, it is very easy to use Grub, and if you ever decide that Ubuntu is not for you (which will hopefully never come up), you can use a 'secure remix' liveCD/USB to uninstall Ubuntu and run Boot Repair so that it loads directly into windows as it normally would. I've heard people say that they don't like Grub, but in my experience it rarely has troubles recognizing any other OS and when it does it is easy to fix by simply running Boot Repair, which has a great support system to help you should you encounter anything you can't resolve. (I don't imagine Microsoft is overly keen on helping you get your Ubuntu partition running, hence why you are asking here, not there.)\nAgain, hopefully you have figured something out, but I just wanted to make you, and anyone else who might have the same problem, aware that you will have a much harder time getting the windows boot-loader to work and will surely have more troubles with it in the end. \n\nA: \nif you ever decide that Ubuntu is not for you (which will hopefully never come up), you can use a 'secure remix' liveCD/USB to uninstall Ubuntu and run Boot Repair so that it loads directly into windows as it normally would.\n\nInterestingly on my Lenovo U410 I don't have to do any of that - Ubuntu is listed in the Boot section of the BIOS setup; all I do is delete it there and the Windows bootloader returns to normal.\n", "Q: Libreoffice equivalent to MS Excel TABLE Im new toLibreoffice and I'm looking for something similar to a EXCEL TABLE, which allows you to autofill formulas in a column without having to do it yourself.\nAny answer is appreciatted.

Protection software and it won't run in wine (wine tricks disappears)left the menu bar tab to the left. How do I know if its running?\nor how do i get it to run?\nRegards,\nG.K.\n\nA: To answer your questions:\n\nI downloaded Toshiba’s H.D.D. Protection software and it won't run in wine (wine tricks disappears)left the menu bar tab to the left.\n\nWINE is just a compatibility layer so all it does is simulate Windows features. What you want is to get low level information WINE does not have a clue about. Status of hardware you always need to check with the running OS. \n\nHow do I know if its running? or how do i get it to run?\n\nYou will not get this Windows software to run. Never ever. \n\nNow for the good news...\n\"Toshiba’s H.D.D. Protection software\" does nothing but read out SMART data and that comes standard with Linux (so Ubuntu too) in the form of smartmontools. \nAnything else it claims to be is marketing: there is no software that can react as fast as hardware. Example: the hardware detects that the heads are going to crash microseconds before it does. By the time the software is told it is going to happen it already happened. So all the software can do is predict on past events when the drive might fail. \nBut companies like to install \"disk protection software\" and advertise it, because people (mostly Windows users ;) ) think it will be helpful and buy it. \nSome topics about SMART (that include commands to see SMART data): \n\n\n*\n\n*Man page smartctl\n\n*Ubuntu wiki on smartmontools\n\n*AskUbuntu topic on SMART with some commands\n\n*Same but on superuser\n\n*http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=893905\n\n*http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1178616\nBy the way: for SMART to work you need a modern hard disc (though I doubt anyone is using one that does not have SMART).\n", "Q: Debug Qt application on ubuntu with root permission using qt creator It is possible to run my application with root priviliges using sudo, like this:\nsudo ./MyApp\n\nIs it possible to debug my Qt application using root priviliges using QtCreator? How can I do this on an Ubuntu system?\n\nA: I would run the program from a terminal with a GDB server (as root) and then connect to the server with gdb from QtCreator. You would start gdbserver with something like this:\n$ sudo gdbserver host:2345 ./MyApp\n\nHere, you are hosting the server with port 2345. You can also check if your application is indeed running with UID 0.\n$ sudo ps -u\n\nNow, in Qt Creator, go Debug -> Start Debugging -> Attach to Running Debug Server. Fill in the form... the most important is the port and server address. I chose 127.0.0.1 and 2345. You can select break at main to break at the beginning of the program. GDB server doesn't start the program until you connect.\n\nA: I solved it by starting Qt Creator as root. \nsudo /usr/bin/qtcreator\n\nNow It will get the root permission to the application when I compile and debug. Now its possible to debug my application with root privilege.\n\nA: *\n\n*Go to Tools-> Options-> Environment\n\n*In the Tab General under **System** Group there is a Terminal Option.\n\n*The default value is set to/usr/bin/xterm -e.

Instead, use the source, and make qtcreator use sudo to launch gdb like this. Requires that you run qtcreator from a tty and auth sudo before you launch qtcreator, or configure your user for passwordless sudo (not recommended).

Boot-Repair\nalso you can't see the drives on which Linux is installed because it uses a different filesystem than windows. you need to install a software if you want to access those drives from Windows but that's not recommended because an accidental change of important files can blow up your Linux for good so you need to take precautions.\n", "Q: Ubuntu does not load after installing it alongside Windows I installed Ubuntu 12.04 and I chose to install 'alongside windows 7'.\nAfter installation and restart, Windows 7 loaded but there is no sign that Ubuntu is actually installed.  \nWindows 7 is installed in hdd0, boots in legacy mode (only 1 HD in machine), UEFI secure boot is disabled.\nI don't see anything on UEFI boot.  \nPartitions on my 1TB HDD: \n\n\n*\n\n*100MB ntfs (win 7 installation made it automatically)\n\n*200GB NTFS (Win 7 partition)\n\n*4 GB Partition (I don't know what fs type)\n\n*rest all unallocated\n\n\nEdit: Yesterday I deleted the unused 4 gb partition current OS is running on live usb fat 32\nThe result of fdisk -l\n\nResult of sudo parted -l\n\n\nA: Solution\nReinstall GRUB2 to the MBR, either:\n\n*\n\n*with the instructions here*, or\n\n*(if you prefer) using any of these methods.\n\n* This should fix the problem even though in this case it was not caused by a recent installation of Windows, see below.\nExplanation\nYou're installing alongside Windows 7 (not Windows 8 or later) and there's no reason to believe this is a UEFI system (no \"Secure Boot\"). Therefore, we should expect that the cause of this problem is the usual cause of Ubuntu failing to boot after being installed as a fully-fledged (i.e., non-Wubi) system.\nSometimes Ubuntu's installer will not successfully install the GRUB2 boot loader to the Master Boot Record. As I answered in this related (but somewhat different) question:\n\nWhile most installations go without anything going wrong, this is\nactually one of the more common installation problems. It can occur if\nyou manually tell the installer not to install GRUB to the master boot\nrecord of the first hard drive, if it identifies the first hard drive\nincorrectly (its idea of first isn't necessarily what the BIOS tries\nto boot first), if it thinks a suitable boot loader is already in\nplace (and is wrong), and possibly for other reasons.\nReinstalling the GRUB2 boot loader to the master boot record of the\ndrive that the BIOS is trying to boot almost always solves this\nproblem. When someone with a working Ubuntu system installs a Windows\nsystem alongside Ubuntu, the Windows installer will overwrite the\nmaster boot record with its own boot loader, which does not detect and\nprovide an option to boot Ubuntu. That's what your situation has in\ncommon with that of users who've just installed Windows beside Ubuntu.\n\n", "Q: Hourly events in the firewall-log, originating from Ubuntu12.04-box.

(GTX560Ti)\n", "Q: Transfer Data from Ubuntu Desktop (PC) to Ubuntu Nexus 7 (tablet) without OTG-cable or Wifi Are there any ways to transfer data without wifi or cloud based services from my Ubuntu Desktop PC to my Nexus 7 (tablet) which is running Ubuntu and NOT Android. \nOr is there any other solution to this problem, besides using memory unit and OTG-cable?\nIs there a way to mount the tablet when it is connected via cable?\n\nA: Never used Ubuntu on an ARM processor, congrats! Does the Nexus 7 have the option of mounting without MTP? Haven't been able to connect my Galaxy Nexus phone to Ubuntu since Jelly Bean rolled out...\nMind you there are still a number of options. I know you don't want a cloud based service such as Ubuntu One or Dropbox, but that's probably still the best option if it's just a handful of files. Though still \"over wifi\", I'd recommend sharing a folder, drive or partition via Samba. It's not \"on the cloud\", it's on one of your machines. To enable sharing a folder outside your home directory, run gksu gedit /etc/samba/smb.conf and then add\n\n# Allow sharing of any partition\n\nusershare owner only = False\n\n\nAlso you might need a password for Samba (even if you don't need it, it's a good idea). Run sudo smbpasswd -a user (replace user with your user name) and set a password.\nActually, full instructions here.\n\nA: This is possible. Using a normal USB cable, you can create a network that the computers can communicate over.\nOverview\nIf you connect your Nexus 7 running Ubuntu to your PC running Ubuntu, your PC will detect the USB connection as a new network connection via a \"CDC Composite Gadget\". Your Nexus 7 will detect the connection as an Ethernet Network. Both will sit there trying to connect to the other, but don't know how. To make them communicate, you'll need to set up a network and give them each an IP. Once you've done that, you can transfer files through the network you made, and the files will be transferred via USB.\nSetting Up the Network\nOn the Nexus 7, click your network icon and then click \"Edit connections...\". In the window that pops up, make sure you're in the \"Wired\" tab, select \"Wired connection 1\" and click \"Edit...\". Go to the IPv4 Settings tab and change Method to \"Manual\". Next, click the Add button to the right of the addresses section, and input 192.168.10.2 as the address and 255.255.255.0 as the netmask. You can leave the Gateway blank. Now click Save... and you should get a notification that says Wired connection 1 is connected. \nThe Nexus 7 is set up, now let's set up the PC.\nThe process will be mostly the same. Click your network icon, but before you click \"Edit connections...\", check which connection uses the CDC Composite Gadget by looking at the list of connections. Mine is Wired connection 3, but yours will probably be Wired connection 2. \nGo ahead and click on \"Edit connections...\", then, in the window that pops up, make sure you are in the \"Wired\" tab and click on the connection that uses the CDC Composite Gadget (Mine is Wired connection 3), then click the \"Edit...\" button. Just as before, head to the \"IPv4 Settings\" tab, change the Method to \"Manual\", and click the \"Add\" button. This time, though, we're going to use a different address- Enter 192.168.10.1 as the address, and the same 255.255.255.0 as the netmask. Now click \"Save...\" and you will get a notification saying that you're connected. The network's been set up! Your computer should remember this next time you connect the USB cable, too.\nTransferring Files\nNow you can use Samba, SSH, SFTP, NFS, or any other network-based file transfer software to transfer files between the two systems. Just remember that the IP for the PC is 192.168.10.1 and the IP for the Nexus 7 is 192.168.10.2. Here's an example on how to copy files from your PC to the Nexus 7 using sshfs:\nOpen a Terminal on the PC. Run sudo apt-get install sshfs to make sure sshfs is installed, then create a folder to mount the files into, like ~/ssh-mount. Now you're going to need to use sshfs to mount the folder on the Nexus 7. To do this, run sshfs user@192.168.10.2:/home/user ~/ssh-mount, keeping in mind that:\nuser should be replaced with the username of the the user on the Nexus 7\n192.168.10.2 is the IP address of the Nexus 7 through the usb cable\n/home/user is the name of the remote directory (on the Nexus 7) you're mounting\n~/ssh-mount is where you're mounting it to.\nPress enter and the program will say something about the key authenticity, just type yes and enter your password (the password of the user on the Nexus 7). It should just put you at a prompt, at which point if you navigate to ~/ssh-mount on your PC, you will see the contents of /home/user on your Nexus 7. You can also do the same thing in reverse between the Nexus 7 and the PC, if you wish.\n", "Q: remote assistance application I goggled around a lot but I didn't find a proper answer to my question, so I'm going to ask it here. \nI convinced my parents to switch to Xubuntu and I would like to offer them remote assistance whenever they need.

As far as I can tell from your comments you did everything as described there. However Cloudera only offers packages for 64Bit architecture. As your system tries to download i386 packages I assume you are running on 32Bit. In this case it is not possible to use this software.\nHowever if you are running 64Bit you download the deb and then run   manually sudo dkpg -i cdh4-repository_1.0_all.deb.

Any suggestion on what I might be doing wrong? Or is there maybe another way of installing FGLRX?\n\nI might not have provided enough details in this post. So if there's any other information you need to help me with this problem, please let me know and I'll be glad to add it.\nRight so an update. I have managed to install the 12.10 driver from catalyst and when I reboot, I get the login screen etc. After I log in, it loads my desktop background, but it does not appear to load unity or anything else. Literally just gets stuck on a desktop background.\n\nAnother update:\nFollowing the 'Answer' marked below this, for both the catalyst 12.10 and 12.11 beta, the problems are still persistent:\nCatalyst 12.10\nIt would appear that Catalyst 12.10 is consistent and can get me as far as the log in window.

However if you want to modify the install it will make things more of a pain as you'll have to re-enable everything using the terminal and your sudo password each time. Up to you to choose which suits your needs better.\n\nA: One way to do that is to open a terminal and run a few commands. First you want a \"guest\" user. To make our user you do:\nsudo adduser guest\nadd any information that would be applicable in the terminal. Then what you want to do is a chmod to change the security of the drive.\nsudo chmod o=wx /\no=other than root wx=write and execute.

I've heard it variously referred to as \"Ubuntu\", \"Ubuntu Phone\", \"Ubuntu Phone OS\", \"Ubuntu for phones\" and probably more.\nAlso, is the interface used on phones called \"Unity\", or is it called something else?\n\nA: The press talk about \"Ubuntu Phone\".\nCanonical calls it \"Ubuntu for Phones\", which should be correct, since they code and publish it and therefore should know best how their products are named.\nSee also: http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone/\nTo answer your second question: The UI is a customized Unity Shell as seen in desktop Ubuntu and is also called Unity.

I just installed cairo-dock and was changing some settings. I tried to change the theme to Mac OS X, which I placed in ~/.config/cairo-dock/themes/Mac OS X/ after which my cairo dock doesn't display at all.

It is not a recognized package for 12.10.\nWhen I run dpkg-buildpackage I have to use sudo.  Could this affect the process?  Should I get fakeroot?\np.s. I know my touchpad at least supports 3-finger gestures because I have used them with windows 8.\n\nA: you need to disable the synclient links with\nsynclient TapButton2=0 \nsynclient TapButton3=0 \nsynclient ClickFinger2=0 \nsynclient ClickFinger3=0 \nsynclient HorizTwoFingerScroll=0 \nsynclient VertTwoFingerScroll=0\n\nA: I finally got this working to my liking. I have a desktop with Ubuntu 14.04.2 and Unity 7.2.5 with an Apple Magic Trackpad (and a bluetooth USB adapter). Hardware setup was basically seamless (easy, no drivers/etc, had a little trouble pairing at first, must hold the button down, no trouble since).\nMy problem was that touchegg and ginn could only be used for 4-finger gestures (Unity blocks or interferes with 2, 3, and 4-finger gestures). I've read using Gnome Desktop could solve the issue, but I'm used to (and already setup with) Unity. I wanted Unity's 2-finger gestures (horiz and vert scrolling), and fully configurable 3 and 4 finger gestures (for workspace switching, etc -- I'll update once I have my full set of gestures worked out.)\n(Note I had previously followed xSwipe setup instructions here, didn't fully work, hopefully this didn't taint my setup.)\nHere's what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable unity gestures as described in the referenced question (updated answer), recompile, restart. (This may not have been necessary, try first without.)\n\n*May have to dis/enable bluetooth trackpad\n\n*Run the referenced commands in the touchegg FAQ to disable synclient's use of 3 and 4 finger gestures (but leave horiz and vert scrolling):\n\n\nCommands:\n  synclient TapButton2=0\n  synclient TapButton3=0\n  synclient ClickFinger2=0\n  synclient ClickFinger3=0\n  synclient HorizTwoFingerScroll=1\n  synclient VertTwoFingerScroll=1\n\nI will likely place these commands in my ~/.xinitrc as described in other questions.\nI do notice that I still can't customize 2-finger gestures (even with horiz/vert disabled), but that's ok for me (for now), I like the default horiz/vert scrolling. Maybe sometime I'll want 2-finger pinch or something, but not yet.\n\nA: I have 14.04 with unity and was tried a lot to install touchegg, which I couldn't. But I've found an alternative solution, it is xSwipe.\nIt's a little bit tiring that editing a text formatted configuration file to find the righteous shortcuts, but after at all, it worths.\nIt works with unity!\n", "Q: How to properly have a theme that is not completely dark but has dark menus in Lubuntu 12.10? I do not like full-dark themes in Lubuntu, but I like dark menus.\n\nIn Lubuntu 12.04 was using one theme that was called Mediteranean Ligh if I remember well that was like that.  \nA similar question got an answer that indicated a new Ambiance theme with dark menus. (At some point I used Ambiance and Clearlooks with dark menus, I think, but cannot find  them anymore.)\nBut after upgrading to 12.10 these themes with dark menus began displaying  some   incorrect white background under fonts on certain menus and buttons. Like this, in the network settings:\n\nor on the buttons of Synaptic\n\nwhile the main menus and most other menus were ok, dark, as supposed to be.\nThis happens when I use my older darked-menus theme MediterraneanLight, or the theme recommended in the answer to the question mentioned (AmbianceOneiric-Master).\n(This question here is Lubuntu-specific. Therefore, please do not flag it as duplicate of others here that ask about having back the dark menus of the Ambiance theme: all these questions have been closed as duplicate of this one, already mentioned, which is Gnome/Unity-specific, and the AmbianceOneiric-Master theme indicated as answer would not work in Lubuntu 12.10.)\nWhat to do?\n\nA: I have a workaround for this: \n\n\n*\n\n*first, I have identified a theme that is most desirable except that it has no dark menus. I selected Ambiance.\n\n*then, I have selected some theme that has dark menus (all of them, like MediterraneanLight and AmbianceOneiric-Master having the problem  reported in the question)\n\n*In usr/share/themes i have created a new folder and in it copied the gtk2 folder of the Ambiance theme and the gtk3 folder of one of the two darked-menus themes mentioned. The new theme resulted works now fine, all menus are dark and without errors. \nI guess Lubuntu doesn't handle well all gtk3 themes. In the themes that i used in Lubuntu there are unity or metacity folders that Lubuntu doesn't use. I guess these can be deleted. So, the idea is to find a theme that has good gtk3 display in Lubuntu (like Ambiance)  and  use its gtk3 folder to \"heal\" the themes that do not work ok concerning gtk3 but have other desirable features (like dark menus) that I guess are related to gtk2.\n\n\n*\n\n*A last fix may be needed for setting the same color scheme for both gtk2 and gtk3 appearance of menus and programs (like selection in the now dark menus: for example Ambiance-GTK3 menus have orange selection while the main menus and others may have blue or other color selection). Lubuntu's \"Customize look and feel\" lets you set the colors yourself. Using customized color scheme for selected items and other stuff would set that color scheme in both gtk2 and gtk3 programs.\n\n\n \n(Taking a theme with dark menus and deleting the gtk3 folder completely would result in the dark menus (which previously had errors) becoming white with dark letters (but with no errors), while some programs that previously had errors like synaptic would appear without any theme).  \nThis \"blindfolded\" and  naive approach is the one I sometimes use to get mixed themes like that.\n", "Q: Where can I find a driver for an Epson XP-405 printer?

Can I write keyboard shortcut in bash script like:\n#!bin/bash\necho Hello\n^z # this is kbd shortcut\n\nThis didn't work. Is there any other way?\n\nA: It depends on what you want to do.  Since you've used ^Z as an example, I assume you're trying to start some command and have it run in the background.  Try adding an & at the end of the command instead:\nsleep 5 && echo Hello &\n\nThat will set the command to run in the background as a sub-shell and will let your script continue - in this case, it would wait 5 seconds then print the word \"Hello\".  When typed manually in a terminal, it will display the process ID.\nMost other terminal keyboard shortcuts should have script equivalents, but some may not.

I am currently stuck using both Python2.6 and Python2.7 on Lubuntu 12.10. 2.6 is required for a piece of software.\nIn attempting to write a plug-in for this software (Opticks), I need to be able to access PyQt4. Using apt-get install python-qt4 I get a perfectly working installation for 2.7...\nI have tried altering the default python version and changing the soft link in /usr/bin to 2.6. No joy. Pip-2.6 and easy_install-2.6 are also unable to install PyQt4 due to the lack of a setup.py file.\nI was able to get this functioning using the suggestion from @dobey and a link on compiling pyQT for python2.7.  In the link, simply change ally python2.7 calls to python2.6.\n\nA: To use PyQt with Python 2.6 on Ubuntu 12.10, you will need to rebuild a custom PyQt against Python 2.6, as it is a compiled module, and not written in Python.\nTo use Opticks with the Python extension for it, on newer versions of Ubuntu, it will need to be ported to 2.7 upstream, and built against 2.7; include it's own version of everything required, or you'll have to build all the dependencies that are needed, yourself. Their Python extension seems to only work with Python 2.4, 2.5, or 2.6.\nIf you don't wish to compile everything yourself, you'll need to get support from the Opticks developers or community.\n", "Q: 700 instead of 755 permissions on auto-mounted USB HDD? I'm running Ubuntu 12.10 (kernel 3.5.0-21-generic) on a laptop, and seem to have run into a strange problem with an auto-mounted external FAT32 USB HDD: The permissions of the drive's mount-directory, and everything in it, is mapped to \"drwx------\" (700) after the auto-mount. The USB-mounted HDD is a Western Digital WDC WD5000BPVT-22HXZT3 (SATA-2); I have another one of these built into the laptop, and that one runs like a charm.\nFrom my understanding the permissions should be 755 instead, and the 700 setting causes serious problems with my backup program (lucky backup); the software simply cannot backup anything anymore because it cannot access the directories on the USB drive. However, manually copying the data to the USB HDD (using nautilus or the terminal) doesn't cause access problems. This might be connected, as these programs access the files directly, not indirectly using a cron-job like the backup tool.\nI did a lot of googling today to try and find similar cases with sollutions, but none worked so far; the best hint I found was that the permissions may get reset to 700 whenever the mouning procedure finds a problem with the USB HDD, for whatever reason. If checked the logs, and found that the device was indeed causing \"HDIO_GET_IDENTITY failed for '/dev/sdc': Invalid argument\" warnings because of hdparm, so I set the \"nohdparm\" option in the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT setting in /etc/default/grub. Checking the logs indicates this took care of the warnings, but sadly didn't change the USB HDD permissions back to normal.\n\nThen I tried another idea that suggested defining a USB mount policy, but no luck there either, it didn't change anything. Therefore my questions remain:\n*\n\n*what are the reasons for FAT32 USB HDDs being auto-mounted with permission 700? And if this is intended, are the powers that be aware how much software is NOT using the current user to access files?\n\n*is this in any way connected with this 3-Year-Old Bug? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nautilus/+bug/390040/\n\n*is there a workaround that doesn't involve avoiding FAT32 on the USB HDDs? After all I like being able to directly access data backups from multiple OS's ...\nThanks in advance ...\n\nA: At last I found a workaround by adding the following static definition to /etc/fstab:\nUUID=7358-CACE /media/backup vfat users,nofail,flush,utf8,umask=0000 0 2\nBasically, the entry defines a user-independent mount-pount for my USB HDD. It simulates root as user and group for anything on the USB HDD, which is fine because umask=0000 assures that everyone can do anything on the drive. The other options are:\n*\n\n*\"nofail\" assures that the kernel doesn't mutter if the drive isn't present at boot time\n\n*\"users\" assures that anyyone can unmount the drive, not just root\n\n*\"flush\" should make sure the drive is flushed often, but not synced\n\n*utf8 should be able to translate special characters in file names properly\n\nThe only problem remaining with this is that nautilus somehow decides to close when I unmount the device, but I can live with that. There is no error entry in syslog or auth.log suggesting it crashed ...\n", "Q: Is there a tool like wifi analyzer for ubuntu?

I just bought myself 2 x 3tb wd red drives and a startech 4 port raid card . Unfortunately, I have a very, very strong suspicion that this is a 'fake-raid' card as it is not from any of the main manufacturers like LSI or 3ware. Transferring files from a WD black 2TB to the raid 1 array is going at an appallingly slow rate of around 60MB/s. Would it not be faster to remove the card, and set up software raid with mdadm?\n--\nUpdate\nI just unplugged/unset the hardware raid 1 array, and re-plugged in the drives directly to the motherboard. Transfers direct from drive to drive appear to go at 120MB/s (exactly double). I realise that raid1 has to duplicate the data, but surely It reads at 120mb/s from one drive and each raid drive should write at nearly 120mb/s on each of the reds? \n\nA: To test if the performance goes up moving to mdadm using a proper host-bus adapter (AHCI) capable card, you should just try that out. I don't have this hardware available, but I can give you some general advice against using 'fakeraid' in favour of Software RAID:\n\n\n*\n\n*Software RAID is totally independent on the controller you're using. In case the controller dies, you can just re-plug the disk in another one and access your data.\n(Okay, you may be screwed as your disks/data may die too after a controller failure, but that's another story.)\n\n*Software RAID has been tested more thoroughly. It's not just running on that particular device - the code is totally independent to it!\n\n*Easier recoverability. In case you totally screw up, more people will be able to help you out, as again, the format of the metadata on the array is independent of the controller.\n\n*Software RAID is more flexible. It allows you to change the RAID type (e.g. upgrade from RAID1 to RAID10, RAID5 to RAID6), resize the array, etc. Some of these features might come with the fakeraid card too, but it's not likely that all of them are included.\n\n*The driver for your fakeraid card may not be developed for anymore some later time. It could prevent you from upgrading the system/kernel. Software RAID is of course not affected by this.\n\n*In case you're troubleshooting performance issues, you're a lot more likely to get help using regular Software RAID, as it's more generally available.\n\n*With some fakeraid cards it's not possible to access the health status of your hard drives anymore (S.M.A.R.T.). Software RAID does not restrict you to do this.\n\n\nDownsides too:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dual boot with Windows will not be possible with software RAID with both OSs on the same array.\n\n*Accessing data from Windows or other OSs not possible. You'll simply need a Linux kernel to access your data.\n\n*maybe more, I can't think of more now\n\nA: If you see the individual disks and the whole array shows up as /dev/mapper/something, then it's a fakeraid.  While mdadm shouldn't be faster, it is better supported and recommended if you don't need to dual boot with windows.\nIt looks like this is some old hardware.  It says it is legacy old PCI rather than any of the flavors of PCI Express.  That means it is limited to a throughput of about 125 MB/s, and since you're writing the data twice to both disks, that's why you are only getting 60 MB/s.\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu Phone OS run Ubuntu Applications? Now that the Ubuntu Phone OS is coming soon, I'm just wondering if it will be able to run Ubuntu Applications like LibreOffice or something else that is not exactly made for the phone but is made for the Ubuntu Desktop\n\nA: As long as they are compiled for ARM processors, then I believe yes. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM\n", "Q: sharing canon all in one over network I have Ubuntu 12.04 installed on an old computer I want to use as a file and printer server in a small office.

As far as I remember the floating menu was available when guest additions were not installed.  \nthanks.\n\nA: This is still a problem/bug and is references in the VirtualBox bug tracker here:\nhttps://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/9775\nThere is a work-around! \nWhile in fullscreen mode in VirtualBox, log out of Ubuntu. When the login screen appears, you should be able to either see the mini-tool bar or you can press the HOST+Home keys to make it visible and it should show up.\nI'm running Mint 17 x64 as my guest on my Win7 x64 host. I have the exact same issue with the fullscreen mini-tool bar, but logging out of Mint makes the toolbar appear. Strangely, when I move the fullscreen to my second monitor and log back in, the mini-tool now becomes visible whilst in the desktop environment.\nAlso:\nUbuntu uses Unity and for me Mint uses Cinnamon, both of which are 3D accelerated Desktop Environments. Maybe MATE is not, which is why it works. If you turn of 3D Acceleration in the VBox settings for your guest, the mini-tool bar should work, but then you'll be in software rendering mode in Ubuntu Unity or Cinnamon.\n\nA: Same here, but for me the <right Ctrl> + F hotkey still works. It will bring the screen back to Windowed view.\n\nA: solved\nI have encountered the same problem after installing guest additions in my ubuntu. Do the following steps :\n\n\n*\n\n*log into your OS which will be stretched or full screened most probably.\n\n*make sure your guest additions are activated.\n\n*press right Ctrl + F to bring up the windowed mode and you will see the toolbar there at the bottom or at top according to your settings made in the virtual box.\n\n*go to display settings from there and click on auto resize and the  make it full screen. \n\n\nNow you can see your toolbar along with full screen OS. \n", "Q: Script to switch between two sound devices I use two sound devices, normal analogue output and sound over HDMI.

Until then I was using the default mesa drivers, and everything was working as a peach. But then Steam came to Linux, and I just had to jump on it. Now my games run smoothly under Ubuntu with Steam, but I have this tearing issues in Chrome.\nAhh, by the way, on Firefox there are no issues.\nFrom the above mentioned post, I have enabled the \"tear free\" option, and that seemed to reduce the problem a bit, but still didn't eliminate it.\nAny suggestions would be welcomed.\nEdit:\nGoing to chrome://plugins/ at the flash-player section I have to following:\n\n\nA: sorry to pop in on this so late. However I was also encountering the issue today and stumbled upon this. What fixed it for me was going to chrome://flags and enabling \"Override software rendering list Mac, Windows, Linux, Chrome OS, Android\nOverrides the built-in software rendering list and enables GPU-acceleration on unsupported system configurations\"\nI guess for some reason for me 2D hw accel wasn't working. \nJust adding this here in case anyone else ever has this issue.\nKind Regards,\nopenSUSE user\n\nA: I have the same problems, seems that the new Pepper Flash version included by default with Chrome doesn't play well with AMD cards. I haven't found a good way to solve it yet, but a workaround is to just use the normal flash player included by Ubuntu instead.\nTo do that, go to chrome://plugins\n\n\n*\n\n*On the right side of the screen, click on \"Details\" if neccasery.\n\n*Search for the Adobe Flash Player plugin and disable the PPAPI (pepper) plugin, leaving the other one enabled.\n\n*Restart the browser to apply the changes.\n\n\nEDIT: Screenshot of what I mean\n", "Q: Upgrade shows many errors (mount command missing) I have had a Windows 7 PC that dual boots to Ubuntu since a couple of years ago but have not used it lately. Today I decided to upgrade to the latest version. It downloaded +1800 files and Ubuntu started to upgrade itself, not without errors along the way. \nAfterwards there was total chaos. I could not start Ubuntu (seemed to be a missing mount) and I could no longer start Windows. Luckily I was able to recover Windows 7, but Ubuntu is \"gone fishing\". \nWhat do I do now? Should I delete Ubuntu, and if yes, how is this done?  Or is there a recovery option?\n\nA: Boot from an Ubuntu live cd/usb. You should be able to access what was your Ubuntu partition from this so that you can back up any important files (I must stress this: please back up your files for your own sake). Then, install and run boot repair:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install boot-repair && gksudo boot-repair\n\nThis code adds the Boot Repair repository, installs Boot Repair, and runs Boot Repair. Once Boot Repair is open, click the button that reads \"Recommended repair (repairs most frequent problems).\" Once it finishes, reboot. \nIf you still can't boot to your Ubuntu partition, then boot back onto the live cd/usb and run Boot Repair again, this time clicking Advanced Options. Check \"Reinstall GRUB\" if it is not already checked and check \"Repair File Systems.\" Then click \"GRUB Options.\" Check \"Purge GRUB before reinstalling it\" and \"Purge kernels and reinstall last kernel.\" Click \"Apply\" to run the repairs. Follow all instructions given on-screen. After Boot Repair finishes, reboot. Hopefully you should be able to boot into Ubuntu again.\nIf even that doesn't work, then do a clean install of Ubuntu (This will overwrite your files, so again: back them up. Please.). On the screen that gives you the option of overwriting all other operating systems or installing alongside, go to \"Something Else\" and select the partitions (root and swap [just look for the one with an ext4 file system for the root, and the one labeled \"swap\" for the swap]) that you were using for Ubuntu previously and tell the installer to use these partitions for the new installation. Unless you want to get rid of Windows, then you can just select to overwrite.\n", "Q: Can source code PPA be safely deleted? So I was wondering.. Whenever you add an PPA, you always get 2 entries. One \"normal\" PPA and a source code PPA (the one that says (source) at the end of the line). Since I am normally not interested in the source code, can the source code entries be safely deleted from the PPA list? I like to keep things clean and might even improve the speed when updating.. :P\n\nA: Unless you need the source code for some reason (curiosity, etc.), yes, they can be safely removed.\n", "Q: Firefox sluggish, printing error message I am using Firefox via ssh on the following machine:\ng1> head -1 /etc/motd\nWelcome to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-26-generic x86_64)\ng1> firefox -version\nMozilla Firefox 17.0.1\n\nWhen called from an xterm, the following message appears repeatedly.

So before you start Firefox type export $(dbus-launch). Now you can start Firefox. However there might another error message appear. If yes you can work around with export NSS_USE_SHARED_DB=ENABLED. Now Firefox should start without error messages or warnings.\nCan can put that alltogether in a shell script:\n#!/bin/sh\nexport $(dbus-launch)\nexport NSS_USE_SHARED_DB=ENABLED\nfirefox &\n\nIf no dbus-launch is installed on your system, you should install the package dbus-x11.

I have an ipython notebook that I would like to print without having the page breaks cut through my figures.\nAny suggestions?  I tried the \"awesome screenshot\" extension for chromium, but it was buggy and ended up cutting out half of my page.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: I recently had the same need, and did it in two steps:\n1) I used the Chrome Screen Capture Extension (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-capture-by-google/cpngackimfmofbokmjmljamhdncknpmg?hl=en) to capture the page in a png\n2) I printed the PNG to a PDF\n\nA: I have managed to use gnome-web-photo in conjunction with imagemagick to produce a decent quality single, tall pdf of a webpage using a single command. You should already have imagemagick, but install gnome-web-photo with\nsudo apt-get install gnome-web-photo\n\nIn this oneliner, convert is the program used from the imagemagick package:\ngnome-web-photo --mode=photo http://www.askubuntu.com --file ask.png && cat ask.png | convert - ask.pdf \n\nThe tall web page is downloaded by gnome-web-photo to file, and can't be piped directly to convert without saving it as an image file first. So one way for convert to receive that file though the pipe is to concatenate it and then use convert - so that the png file is received by convert via stdin (denoted as -) and then converted to pdf. \nHowever, for the second part of the command you could use && convert ask.png ask.pdf instead of && cat ask.png | convert - ask.pdf, but both take about the same time.\nYou can use the --print option with gnome-web-photo to print a webpage to file (i.e. pdf), but it didn't produce a suitable single page result, so the oneliner above is about the best that can be done. \n\nA: PDF has a defined media size, so you're going to have to do some workarounds:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up a custom page size in your printer. I have one, TenLetter, which is 215.9 × 2794 mm, or a sheet the length of 10 US letter pages end to end. It doesn't split unless the whole content is longer than ten pages. It's a pain to view (zoom is your friend) or to print, but it doesn't break any images.\n\n*Manually import the static HTML page into a wordprocessor, and do manual page breaks before the images you don't want split.\nAutomatic pagination is a hard problem, and most browsers aren't that great at implementing printing support. CSS Print Profile is one of those great ideas that almost works for everyone …\n", "Q: How to configure the clock date format to ISO 8601 in Unity? By default, the time in AM/PM style is shown, I would like to have the same that ls gives:\n2013-01-09 01:12\n\nThat is 24 hours and ISO 8601.  How can I do this?\nI am aware of the following question. Maybe that question was too general to be answered:\nHow do I change to ISO 8601 date format?\nI tried the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*I click on the actual clock-display and I get a calendar. In that calendar I read \"Time & Date Settings..\" - so I click on it: No effect. No nothing.\n\n*I right-click on the clock-display but I get the same calendar like when left-clicking on it.\n\nA: There's no easy way to do it in the GUI.  One can either use dconf-editor (which is GUI-ish), and edit two keys in /com/canonical/indicator/datetime (time-format to custom, and custom-time-format to the desired strftime directives, in your case %F %R (or, equivalently, %Y-%m-%d %H:%M)), or do it directly from the terminal with the following two commands (which, just to be clear, change the same keys):\ndconf write /com/canonical/indicator/datetime/time-format \"'custom'\"\ndconf write /com/canonical/indicator/datetime/custom-time-format \"'%F %R'\"\n\nNote that the doubled quotes are necessary due to dconf's idiosyncracies. (For clarity, I'm referring to the nesting of single quotes (') inside double quotes (\").) Note also that to include seconds, one can replace %R with %T.\nI do not recall which release started including the dconf tools by default, so if they are unavailable, simply install the dconf-tools package and proceed.\nUpdate 2016-05-17: While the above should still work, as a matter of principle it's probably better to access the dconf database via gsettings set than dconf write -- same database, but a tool more intended for end-users. The corresponding GUI-ish tool remains dconf-editor.\n", "Q: How does copy-paste work with xterm? Left-down-clicking in xterms starts the selection of something to be copy-pasted.\nDouble-left clicking selects a word.\nTriple-left clicking selects a line.\nAll this works under unity in 11.04.  However, there is no way to copy-paste that selection to another place: The right-click menu shows paste disabled, and middle-clicking to copy-paste does not work.\nSo how can I copy a selection from an xterm into another place? I am happy with any method to perform this.\n(I am using the default-installation no special configuration so far)\nEdit: Same problem with xedit\n\nA: When you copy from xterm, just use\nshift + middle click\nto paste something into gedit or some editor in xterm like mcedit\n\nA: Use middle click or Shift + Insert\nSee X Window selection.\n\nA: To copy text in Xterm first select the text and then press shift+PrtScr. To paste text in Xterm use shift+Insert .\n\nA: This does not quite answer your question, but it helped me, so am putting it here as it may help someone else:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy what you want from xterm by selecting your text\n\n*Open a second copy of xterm and your favorite text editor (I use vim)\n\n*Use Shift+Insert (or middle-click) to paste into your text editor\n\n*Save the file.\n\n*If necessary open the file with a graphical text editor (such as gedit)\n\n*Copy your text and paste it into the application that you want.\n\n\nA: Xterm uses cut buffers, not the standard X11 clipboard selection used for standard copy-paste that gnome-terminal and most other Linux programs now use.\nBut if you start xterm like this:\nxterm -ls -xrm 'XTerm*selectToClipboard: true'&\n\nthen selections are available via the standard clipboard.\nRead more at Copying and Pasting in Xterm | StarNet Knowledge Database - PC X, X Windows, X 11 & More - StarNet\nThe xcb program also provides command-line access to the cut buffers.\nE.g. in Trusty Tahr 12.04, running lxde window manager, I can triple click on a line of text in xterm, which highlights it and puts it in cut buffer 0.  I can then run\n    xcb -p 0\nwhich prints the line out on stdout.\nFor some reason it didn't work for me to click both buttons (simulating middle click) in an xterm, but shift-insert did work in an xterm.\n\nA: Xterm uses the primary X11 selection, which is different to the clipboard. The program xsel can be used to copy the primary selection into the clipboard:\nxsel -op | xsel -ib\n\nIn order to do so I have defined Meta-c in Fluxbox for this.\nMod4 c :Exec xsel -op | xsel -ib\n\nThis is handy for Windows programs, which support only one clipboard (for example VirtualBox).\n\nA: When you select text, it's put automatically in the cut buffer (like a clipboard).  When you use Copy, from a menu, or with a keyboard shortcut, it goes into the main clipboard.\nTo paste from the cut buffer into your xterm, middle-click.  To paste from the clipboard into your xterm, shift middle-click.\n\nA: To copy between xterm and other programs/documents/... \nAdd to the file ~/.Xresources (or create):\nXTerm*selectToClipboard: true\n\nThen run the command: \nxrdb -merge ~/.Xresources\n\nRestart xterm.\n\nA: A similar issue is discussed here. As \"strings\" pointed out:\n\nX has two clipboards if you select something in xterm, it will goto\n  the cut buffers, in which case you can paste with middle click or\n  shift+insert. which is not the same concept as copy an paste.\n\nCopy/paste within xterm worked for me but not to an application outside, example gedit. As per the link above, I installed parcellite and that fixed the problem,\nsudo apt-get install parcellite\n\nUpdate: If \"paste\" does not work with \"shift-insert\", then use the middle mouse button or if you do not have one click both the left and right buttons simultaneously to paste.\n\nA: See here for an explanation of paste problems with xterms and modern apps/window managers:\nhttp://www.davidsimmons.com/soft/xtermhacks/#copynpaste\n\nA: If you want to retain support for PRIMARY and still be able to use the CLIPBOARD (this is cool since basically you get two clipboards instead of one), you can ignore selectToClipboard and set the translations resource instead:\n*VT100*translations:    #override \\n\\\n    Ctrl <KeyPress> Insert: copy-selection(CLIPBOARD) \\n\\\n    Shift <KeyPress> Insert: insert-selection(CLIPBOARD)\n\nAfter that, if you select a text with your mouse it will get copied to PRIMARY, and a middle-mouse click will paste the text back from PRIMARY, just like the default XTerm behaves.\nAt the same time, Ctrl+Insert will copy the text to CLIPBOARD and Shift+Insert will paste it, similarly to modern GUI applications.\nIf you wish, you can add more key bindings in a similar way, and you can also have more than two clipboards by using X Cut Buffers (they can be referenced as CUT_BUFFER0, CUT_BUFFER1, etc.). More on X Cut Buffers here.\nSee also this question.\n\nA: What worked for me was extracted from https://www.davidsimmons.com/soft/xtermhacks/#copynpastenopatch\nSummary:\nAdd to ~/.Xresources\nXTerm*VT100.translations: #override <Btn1Up>: select-end(PRIMARY, CLIPBOARD, CUT_BUFFER0)\n\nand the run xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources.\n\nA: Emacs command (put it in your ~/.emacs init file) to ignore the selection and use the primary:\n;; Get highlighted text from any window,\n;; e.g., drag the mouse in xterm\n;; then press Super-V in Emacs.\n\n(global-set-key [(super v)]\n        (defun yank-x11-primary ()\n          \"Insert highlighted x windows text.\"\n          (interactive)\n          (insert (gui-get-primary-selection))))\n\n\nA: I have otherwise useful Glipper clipboard manager running on 12.04.\nIf I select xterm characters, they appear in a new Glipper's entry.\nIf I select that entry (button) among that succession, the next paste will come from it and paste those characters into any application.\n", "Q: How can I install nbconvert? I tried installing nbconvert via the instructions on their readme.

I'm using xmonad, and I would like to open a nautilus window to a certain directory, because I like the convenience of browsing inside an encrypted zip file without unzipping it, which nautilus allows. \nhowever, opening nautilus, even with a path argument starts a desktop on the monitor I'm using (There are 8 xmonad monitors) The desktop is inoperative and renders that monitor useless until nautilus is killed.\nIs there any way to open just a nautilus window without any desktop starting?\n\nA: Run gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background show-desktop-icons false and Nautilus will always start without drawing the icons on the background.\nYou can also run dconf-editor to change the setting with a GUI, if you'd like.\nYou may need to reset your background image settings, depending on how well the system handles the nautilus background window disappearing.\n\nA: Execute nautilus with:\nnautilus --no-desktop &\n\nYou can change the launcher accordingly or create a new one for your purpose.\nEdit: Added ampersand so that the process is run in the background. (Props to @user117123)\n\nA: For any user like ZiTAL who is curious on how to change gsettings for nemo, you must type a very similar command (I thought it necessary to put this here because I have not seen anyone mention it before).

Now that even cheap laptops are coming with touchscreens I was wondering if Canonical plans to include its new touch version of Unity GUI on regular Ubuntu for use in laptops and desktops.\n\nA: Unity already supports touchscreens. See, for example, this article. Unity was made from the very beginning to work the same way on different kinds of devices with different kinds of input hardware--that's why it's called \"Unity\".\nSo it's unclear exactly what it would mean for the \"touch version\" of Unity to be ported for desktop use. Not much information is available about Ubuntu for Phones yet, and it's not available for use or testing, so it would hard to answer highly specific questions.\nRight now, we don't know what changes, if any, will be made to the phone version of Unity but not to mainline Unity. For all we know, they might end up having the same source code (perhaps with some differences in configuration or build options). From the official information about how Ubuntu for Phones works, the interface is shown to be operated in the same way.\nOn the other hand, perhaps there will be extensive changes. After all, Unity is a Nux plugin for Compiz, which may not be available on phones (or may work differently) even by the time Ubuntu for Phones ships.\n", "Q: How do I rotate my display when not using an X Server? I have a widescreen monitor that rotates. I'm trying to use it in 'landscape' mode (vertical). This is easy in the GUI.\nHow do I rotate my display when I am not running an X Server or when I am viewing a Virtual Console / Terminal.\n\nA: You can rotate your virtual framebuffers using fbcon.  0 through 3 to represent the various rotations:\n\n\n*\n\n*0 - Normal rotation\n\n*1 - Rotate clockwise\n\n*2 - Rotate upside down\n\n*3 - Rotate counter-clockwise \n\n\nThese can be set from the command line by putting a value into the correct system file.  Rotate the current framebuffer:\necho 1 | sudo tee /sys/class/graphics/fbcon/rotate\n\nRotate all virtual framebuffers:\necho 1 | sudo tee /sys/class/graphics/fbcon/rotate_all\n\nIf you want this to happen automatically when you start your system, you need to modify your boot loader configuration to give it the correct options.  In /etc/default/grub add fbcon=rotate:1 to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"fbcon=rotate:1\"\n\n(Don't forget to run sudo update-grub after changing this file.)\nSources: Rotate Screen, not running X windows, Rotate console on startup (Debian)\n\nA: You can only rotate your display with some kind of X server. A virtual console as well as framebuffer has no support for rotating.\nBut maybe you can run some small X window manager like awesome and a terminal in full-screen mode. In this case you would get the rotation feature and it still feels like a console.\n", "Q: No cd Rom. No installation?

I want to in order to use iTunes and sync my iPhone.\n\nA: You are, in effect, asking about a few different possibilities, already covered by some existing questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Yes, you can dual boot Ubuntu and Windows. This should already be working for you though, as a Wubi system (like yours) is dual-boot. This means that when you turn your computer on, you should be presented with a menu of two choices: Ubuntu and Windows. Simply select the operating system you want to boot that operating system.\n\n*Alternatively you can run Windows in a virtual machine and connect your iPhone 5 via USB to the virtual machine.\n\n*You might interested in this question: Is it possible yet to synchronise music to an iPhone running iOS 5/6? for information on the possibility of syncing your iPhone in Ubuntu.\nYou cannot seamlessly switch between your Ubuntu system and your Windows system, without rebooting, except by creating a virtual machine. (And if you do that, it will be a separate virtual system, not the same Windows system as is installed normally. Your Windows partition hosts the disk image containing your Wubi installation of Ubuntu, making virtualizing the installed system itself even more difficult and risky than it ordinarily would.)\nIf you need more details or need help getting any of these to work, you can edit your question to provide more details.\n", "Q: using a byobu and disconnected session how to see message on screen I use byobu on sh and was doing some program which was left over for  at least 24 hours,\nI had disconnected from the machine and logged in back after 24 hours is there a way I could see the messages which were on screen in this case.I am using Ubuntu 11.10\n\nA: Just run\nbyobu\n\nagain and it will re-attach to the current session in the background (for the current user).

But, much more significantly, note the square brackets. This does something very different to what you were expecting. I suggest you read up on regex. \nThe apt-* commands all take arguments in the form of regex strings; however, different apt-* commands handle them differently. apt-cache search searches both name and description fields, whilst apt-get searches just the name field. apt-cache disregards case, whilst apt-get respects it, etc. It's all relatively intuitive behaviour, so you don't need to think about it most of the time.\nHere's some examples of the behaviour of apt-get. Note how regex can be used. I advise against testing these yourself, so I have added the -s flag - this runs a simulation, as opposed to actually changing your system.\nsudo apt-get install -s anyedit\nThis matches all packages called \"anyedit\" precisely - there aren't any.\nsudo apt-get install -s anyedit.*\nThis matches all packages with \"anyedit\" anywhere in the name - this is going to find \"eclipse-anyedit\".\nsudo apt-get install -s ^anyedit.*\nThis matches all packages where the name starts with \"anyedit\" - there aren't any.\nsudo apt-get install -s [a-z]edit.*\nThis is starting to get bad. Now we're matching all packages where the name contains the text \"edit\" directly preceeded by any lowercase alphabetical character - it it would match \"gedit\", \"kcoloredit\", \"gedit-latex-plugin\", \"ckeditor\", etc.\nsudo apt-get install -s [abc]\n[abc] matches either a, or b, or c. This will find every package which contains any of those characters in its name. So it will install most of the packages in the repositories.\nsudo apt-get remove --purge -s [Ecplise]\nThis matches every package which contains one of c,e,i,l,p,s or E in its name. This regex matches over 98% of the packages in the repositories, and unfortunately your command has requested they all be fully deleted along with their configuration. Now you can hopefully understand what happened.\nReading package lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree       \nReading state information...

I then installed lxde, but wanted to get rid of lxdm, so I uninstalled it. Upon doing so, typing startx or startlxde kicks me into the previous openbox session and not into the lxde session. How do I fix this?\n\nA: My understanding is that you've removed lxdm and booting into command line. Why not install another desktop manager, instead of lxdm ? For instance sudo apt-get install gdm or sudo apt-get install lightdm ? In fact, if you installed lxde after installing ubuntu, lightdm should be on your machine already.

This is designed for business, rather than home usage. It comes preloaded with many apps and tools ready and helpful to your business. \nHow can I download the Business Remix of Ubuntu Desktop?\nYou must fill out a short form at the bottom of the page stating your personal details, which will be in the strictest of confidence, abiding by the Ubuntu Privacy Poilcy.\n\nYou will also need to provide details about your workplace, to further help improve Ubuntu for business. It is also kept privately.\n\nFinally, you must agree to the EULA.\n\nAfter that, you are free to download!\nWhat are the features of Ubuntu Desktop Business Remix?\nUbuntu Business Desktop Remix is a starting point for large-scale corporate desktop deployments. It is inspired by a review of common changes made by IT departments deploying Ubuntu at scale.\nThe remix retains all the goodness of an Ubuntu Long-Term Support (LTS) release and is compatible with all Ubuntu certified hardware, apps and tools, adding business-focused tools from the standard Ubuntu and partner archives and removing home-user oriented apps. There are no modified or enhanced packages in the remix and it gets its security updates from the same place as standard Ubuntu; it’s just a convenient starting point that includes many common changes made by IT administrators deploying Ubuntu in a corporate setting.\nThis first LTS-based release includes the Adobe Flash Plugin, VMware View, and the OpenJDK 6 Java run-time environment, while removing social networking software, file sharing apps, games and development/sysadmin tools. We now include full language support and both 32 and 64-bit builds, just the same as Ubuntu.\nThe result is a simple base image that can be deployed into your corporate environment or used as a starting point for further customisation. Users also benefit from great new features like built-in Microsoft Windows RDP 7.1 support and the Microsoft Visio diagram importer in LibreOffice Draw.\nInstallation images are available now for free download with registration below. Deployments can be supported through a standard Ubuntu Advantage agreement from Canonical, or unpaid. Management of large scale desktop deployments, either of this remix or standard Ubuntu, is best achieved with Canonical’s Landscape management tool. Archives, packages and updates are identical to all other Ubuntu images.\n- Taken from here.

In bash or sh, I guess anything which starts with # is a comment.\nBut in bash scripts we write:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nAnd in Python scripts, there is:\n#!/bin/python\n\nDoes this mean that # by itself is a comment whereas #! is not?\n\nA: A shebang is the character sequence consisting of the characters number sign and exclamation mark (e.g. \"#!\") when it occurs as the initial two characters on the initial line of a script.\nUnder *nix operating systems, when a script starting with a shebang is run, the program loader parses the rest of the script's initial line as an interpreter directive; the specified interpreter program is run instead, passing to it as an argument the path that was initially used when attempting to run the script. For example, if a script is named with the path \"path/to/your-script\", and it starts with the following line:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nthen the program loader is instructed to run the program \"/bin/sh\" instead e.g. the Bourne shell or a compatible shell, passing \"path/to/your-script\" as the first argument. \nAccordingly, it a script is named with the path \"path/to/python-script\" and it starts with the following line:\n#!/bin/python\n\nthen the program loaded is instructed to run the program \"/bin/python\" instead e.g. Python interpreter, passing \"path/to/python-script\" as the first argument.\nIn short \"#\" will comment out a line while the character sequence \"#!\" occurring as the first two characters on the initial line of a script has meaning outlined as above.\nFor details see Why do some scripts start with #! ... ?\nSource: Some sections of this answer are derived (with slight modification) from Shebang (Unix) on English Wikipedia (by Wikipedia contributors). This article is licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0, same as user content here on AU, so this derivation is permitted with attribution.\n\nA: #! is called the shebang when it occurs as the initial two characters on the initial line of a script. It is used in scripts to indicate an interpreter for execution. The shebang is for the operating system(kernel), not for the shell; so it won't be interpreted as a comment.\nCourtesy: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29 \n\nIn general, if a file is executable, but actually not an executable\n  (binary) program, and such a line is present, the program specified\n  after #! is started with the scriptname and all its arguments. These\n  two characters # and ! have to be the first two bytes in the file!\n\nDetailed Info: http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/basics#the_shebang\n\nA: The #! line is used before the script is run, then ignored when the script runs.\nYou're asking what the difference is between a shebang line and an ordinary comment.\nA line starting with #! is just as much a comment as any other line that starts with #. This is true if the #! is the first line of the file, or anywhere else. #!/bin/sh has an effect, but it is not read by the interpreter itself.\n# is not a comment in all programming languages but, as you know, it's a comment in Bourne-style shells including sh and bash (as well as most non-Bourne-style shells, like csh). It's also a comment in Python. And it is a comment in a variety of configuration files that are not really scripts at all (like /etc/fstab).\nSuppose a shell script begins with #!/bin/sh. That is a comment, and the interpreter (the shell) ignores everything on the line after the # character.\nThe purpose of a #! line is not to give information to the interpreter. The purpose of the #! line is to tell the operating system (or whatever process launches the interpreter) what to use as the interpreter.\n\n*\n\n*If you invoke the script as an executable file, for example, by running ./script.sh, the system consults the first line to see if begins with #!, followed by zero or more spaces, followed by a command. If it does, it runs that command with the name of the script as its argument. In this example, it runs /bin/sh script.sh (or, technically, /bin/sh ./script.sh).\n\n\n*If you invoke the script by explicitly calling the interpreter, the #! line is never consulted. So, if you run sh script.sh, the first line has no effect. If script2.sh's first line is #!/usr/games/nibbles, running sh script2.sh will not try to open the script in nibbles (but ./script2.sh will).\nYou'll notice that in neither case does the script's extension (.sh), if it has one, impact how it is run. In a Unix-like system, this doesn't ordinarily affect how the script is run. On some other systems, like Windows, the #! shebang line might be ignored entirely by the system, and the extension might determine what runs the scripts. (This doesn't mean you need to give your scripts extensions, but it is one of the reasons why if you do, they should be correct.)\n#! was chosen to serve this purpose precisely because # begins a comment. The #! line is for the system, not the interpreter, and it should be ignored by the interpreter.\nShebang Line for Bash Scripts\nYou (originally) said you use #!/bin/sh for bash scripts. You should only do that if the script doesn't require any of bash's extensions--sh needs to be able to run the script. sh is not always a symlink to bash. Often, including on all remotely recent Debian and Ubuntu systems, sh is a symlink to dash.\nShebang Line for Python Scripts\nYou also said (in the first version of your question, before editing) that you start your Python scripts with #!/bin/sh read by the interpretor. If you mean that literally, then you should definitely stop doing that. If hello.py begins with that line, running ./hello.py executes:\n/bin/sh read by the interpretor hello.py\n\n/bin/sh will try to execute a script called read (with by the interpretor hello.py as its arguments), read will (hopefully) not be found, and your Python script will never be seen by a Python interpreter.\nIf you're making this mistake but not having the problem I'm describing, you're probably invoking your Python scrips by explicitly specifying the interpreter (e.g., python hello.py), causing the first line to be ignored. When you distribute your scripts to others, or use them a long while later, it may not be clear that this is necessary for them to work. It's best to fix them now. Or at least remove the first line entirely, so that when they fail to run with ./ the error message will make sense.\nFor Python scripts, if you know where the Python interpreter is (or is going to be), you can write the #! line the same way:\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nOr, if it's a Python 3 script, you should specify python3, since python is almost always Python 2:\n#!/usr/bin/python3\n\nHowever, the problem is that while /bin/sh is supposed to always exist, and /bin/bash almost always exists on systems where bash comes with the OS, Python may exist in a variety of places.\nTherefore, many Python programmers use this instead:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\n(Or #!/usr/bin/env python3 for Python 3.)\nThis makes the script rely on env being in the \"right place\" instead of relying on python being in the right place. That's a good thing, because:\n\n*\n\n*env is almost always located in /usr/bin.\n\n*On most systems, whichever python should run your script is the one that appears first in the PATH. Starting hello.py with #!/usr/bin/env python make ./hello.py run /usr/bin/env python hello.py, which is (virtually) equivalent to running python hello.py.\n\nThe reason you cannot use #!python is that:\n\n*\n\n*You want the interpreter specified to be given by an absolute path (i.e., starting with /).\n\n*The calling process would execute python in the current directory. Searching the path when the command doesn't contain a slash is specific shell behavior.\n\nOccasionally a Python or other script that isn't a shell script will have a shebang line starting with #!/bin/sh ... where ... is some other code. This is sometimes correct, because there are some ways to invoke the Bourne-compatible shell (sh) with arguments to make it invoke a Python interpreter. (One of the arguments will probably contain python.) However, for most purposes, #!/usr/bin/env python is simpler, more elegant,  and more likely to work the way you want.\nShebang Lines in Other Languages\nMany programming and scripting languages, and some other file formats, use # as a comment. For any of them, a file in the language can be run by a program that takes it as an argument by specifying the program on the first line after #!.\nIn some programming languages, # is not normally a comment, but as a special case the first line is ignored if it starts with #!. This facilitates the use of #! syntax even though # doesn't otherwise make a line a comment.\nShebang Lines for Files That Don't Run As Scripts\nWhile it's less intuitive, any file whose file format can accommodate a first line starting with #! followed by the full path of an executable can have a shebang line. If you do this, and the file is marked executable, then you can run it like a program...causing it to be opened like a document.\nSome applications use this behavior intentionally. For example, in VMware, .vmx files define virtual machines. You can \"run\" a virtual machine as though it were a script because these files are marked executable and have a shebang line causing them to be opened in a VMware utility.\nShebang Lines for Files That Don't Run as Scrips but Act Like Scripts Anyway\nrm removes files. It is not a scripting language. However, a file that starts #!/bin/rm and is marked executable can be run, and when you run it, rm is invoked on it, deleting it.\nThis is often conceptualized as \"the file deletes itself.\" But the file is not really running at all. This is more like the situation described above for .vmx files.\nStill, because the #! line facilitates the running of a simple command (including command-line arguments), you can perform some scripting this way. As a simple example of a \"script\" more sophisticated than #!/bin/rm, consider:\n#!/usr/bin/env tee -a\n\nThis takes user input interactively, echoes it back to the user line-by-line, and appends it to the end of the \"script\" file.\nUseful? Not very. Conceptually interesting? Totally! Yes. (Somewhat.)\nConceptually Similar Programming/Scripting Concepts (just for fun)\n\n*\n\n*Scripts/programs that are multiple languages at once, for example, to simulate hashbang functionality in OSes that didn't have it.\n(These programs are called polyglots, but this is not to be confused with the other sense of polyglot in software development, a program/project where different parts are written in different languages.)\n\n\n*Metacommands in QBasic/QuickBASIC, which signaled to the compiler (for compiled code) options for code generation, but were part of comments and thus ignored during actual compilation/interpretation.\n\nA: No, it is only used by the exec system call of the Linux kernel, and treated as a comment by the interpreter\nWhen you do on bash:\n./something\n\non Linux, this calls the exec system call with the path ./something.\nThis line of the kernel gets called on the file passed to exec: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.8/fs/binfmt_script.c#L25\nif ((bprm->buf[0] != '#') || (bprm->buf[1] != '!'))\n\nIt reads the very first bytes of the file, and compares them to #!.\nIf the comparison is true, then the rest of the line is parsed by the Linux kernel, which makes another exec call with path /usr/bin/env python and current file as the first argument:\n/usr/bin/env python /path/to/script.py\n\nand this works for any scripting language that uses # as a comment character.\nAnd yes, you can make an infinite loop with:\nprintf '#!/a\\n' | sudo tee /a\nsudo chmod +x /a\n/a\n\nBash recognizes the error:\n-bash: /a: /a: bad interpreter: Too many levels of symbolic links\n\n#! just happens to be human readable, but that is not required.\nIf the file started with different bytes, then the exec system call would use a different handler. The other most important built-in handler is for ELF executable files: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.8/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L1305 which checks for bytes 7f 45 4c 46 (which also happens to be human readable for .ELF). Let's confirm that by reading the 4 first bytes of /bin/ls, which is an ELF executable:\nhead -c 4 \"$(which ls)\" | hd \n\noutput:\n00000000  7f 45 4c 46                                       |.ELF|\n00000004                                                                 \n\nSo when the kernel sees those bytes, it takes the ELF file, puts it into memory correctly, and starts a new process with it. See also: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8352535/how-does-kernel-get-an-executable-binary-file-running-under-linux/31394861#31394861\nFinally, you can add your own shebang handlers with the binfmt_misc mechanism. For example, you can add a custom handler for .jar files. This mechanism even supports handlers by file extension. Another application is to transparently run executables of a different architecture with QEMU.\nI don't think POSIX specifies shebangs however: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/346214/32558 , although it does mention in on rationale sections, and in the form \"if executable scripts are supported by the system something may happen\".\n", "Q: In Unity, how can I hide the global menu on an application running fullscreen in a second monitor? I often play video content on my second screen, and I've noticed that when the fullscreen application loses focus (i.e. I go back to doing something on my main screen) a global menu bar appears above it. I find that distracting -- is there some way to prevent the menu bar from appearing in that context?\n\nA: Install CompizConfig Settings Manager  if you don't have it installed in your system.\nTo do that, either click the link or open a Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager.\nThen open CompizConfig Settings Manager (by running the ccsm), select \"Ubuntu Unity Plugin\" if you dont find it search for it in the search toolbar. In Ubuntu Unity Plugin select the  \"Experimental\" tab, adjust the menus-fade in/out time duration according to whatever you want.\n\nA: I'm not sure if this is a solution or just workaround, but I found this to work pretty well. I do have exactly the same problem. Dual monitors and when one app is in fullscreen on one monitor, but loses focus, the app menu appears over it. Simply right click on the menu and toggle 'Always on top'. It works not only with vlc, but also with a firefox window and fullscreen youtube etc.\n", "Q: apt-get install git-core failed After running sudo apt-get install git-core, I get\nUnpacking git-core (from .../git-core_1%3a1.7.4.1-3_all.deb) ...\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n /var/cache/apt/archives/git_1%3a1.7.4.1-3_amd64.deb\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nSo I followed the instructions from Error Installing Git with Apt-Get but that didn't work either.\nI encountered this after running sudo dpkg --remove --force-remove-reinstreq git:\ndpkg: warning: overriding problem because --force enabled:\n Package is in a very bad inconsistent state - you should\n reinstall it before attempting a removal.\n(Reading database ... \ndpkg: warning: files list file for package `git' missing, assuming package has no files currently installed.\ndpkg: warning: files list file for package `git-man' missing, assuming package has no files currently installed.\ndpkg: warning: files list file for package `git-core' missing, assuming package has no files currently installed.\n(Reading database ... 79719 files and directories currently installed.)\nRemoving git ...\n\nAt some point I was asked to run sudo apt-get -f install to fix things but it's saying its going to install git\nThe following extra packages will be installed:\n  git\nSuggested packages:\n  git-doc git-el git-arch git-cvs git-svn git-email git-daemon-run git-gui gitk gitweb\nThe following NEW packages will be installed:\n  git\n0 upgraded, 1 newly installed, 0 to remove and 480 not upgraded.\n1 not fully installed or removed.\nNeed to get 4,658kB of archives.\nAfter this operation, 10.9MB of additional disk space will be used.\n\nAnd after clicking yes, the error occurs again:\nDo you want to continue [Y/n]? y\nGet:1 http://ubuntu.mirror.cambrium.nl/ubuntu/ natty/main git 1:1.7.4.1-3 [4,658kB]\nFetched 4,658kB in 5s (907kB/s)\nSelecting previously deselected package git.\n(Reading database ... \ndpkg: warning: files list file for package `git-man' missing, assuming package has no files currently installed.\n\ndpkg: warning: files list file for package `git-core' missing, assuming package has no files currently installed.\n(Reading database ... 79719 files and directories currently installed.)\nUnpacking git (from .../git_1%3a1.7.4.1-3_amd64.deb) ...\n/var/lib/dpkg/tmp.ci/preinst: 12: dpkg-maintscript-helper: not found\ndpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/git_1%3a1.7.4.1-3_amd64.deb (--unpack):\n subprocess new pre-installation script returned error exit status 127\n/var/lib/dpkg/tmp.ci/postrm: 14: dpkg-maintscript-helper: not found\ndpkg: error while cleaning up:\n subprocess new post-removal script returned error exit status 127\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n /var/cache/apt/archives/git_1%3a1.7.4.1-3_amd64.deb\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nFor some reasons, when I do dpgk --get-selections | grep git, I get:\ngit                                             install\ngit-core                                        install\ngit-man                                         install\n\nSo I'm stuck in this cycle.

Currently there are just too many places to set touchpad properties and behaviour.\n\n\n*\n\n*The default sytem settings moused and touchpad tool.\n\n*The dconf-editor key /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/mouse/\n\n*The synclient tool\n\n*The syndaemon tool\n\n*The xinput tool\n\n*The gpointing-device-settings tool.\n\n*Editing files inside the /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ directory\n\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if there were even more places....\nCan I use a single place to control the touchpad, and get rid of overthing else?\n Synclient seems to cover all the bases, but should I do this a different way?\nCurrently syndaemon seems to be run by lightdm, and I can't tell if it's interfering with my synclient settings referring to disabling the touchpad while typing, or not. I also wouldn't know how to stop lightdm from starting an instance of syndaemon if that was the case.\nThe gpointing-device-settings tool, while nice, seems obsolete and doesn't write the settings anywhere meaningful, so it has to be run each time the system is either woken up from sleep or reboot.\nIt seems the key at dconf-editor must be deactivated in order for X11 to gain control over the touchpad, otherwise there's no way to know who's controlling who (X11 or Gnome). Why are there two instances of controlling the touchpad. Is it better to leave Gnome under control or X11?\nThere's no way to tell what the default system settings touchpad section does, after using any of the other methods. Is it overriden by synclient, xinput, xorg.conf.d files or viceversa?\nFinally, it's unclear if I should use synclient or xinput, which one takes precedence, etc.\nI'd appreciate any guidance here.\n\nA: Different desktops use different methods. Unfortunately, it depends wholly on where the touchpad driver looks in your session. For example, Puppy Linux with JWM uses flsynclient, KDE uses (what at least used to be) Synaptiks. Really, it depends on which desktop you use. Generally speaking, it is best to leave it to whatever environment you use. If you use something like KDE and GNOME side-by-side, you may need to modify the X11 config files directly, because their individual settings don't interact. However, if you use GNOME or Xfce etc. almost exclusively, use the settings from that desktop.\nThe reason is simply convenience. If you edit X's configuration or use a third-party tool, when GNOME tries to shut off the touchpad, say for typing, it may be overridden by the environment. Extensions that manage touchpad will probably not work. Even if they do work, their settings are likely to be unreliable because when they do some automatic change, they will take over. On next reboot the system will have control because that's the way you have it set up.\nThe only case where another client is necessary is if you really need more settings than the environment you use offers.\nNote that LightDM has its own user, and so you can log in using Su to change the settings. I believe that the lightdm user has a gnome control center as well and can set settings for touchpad that way, but I have no way of telling for sure.\n", "Q: How do I fix name service for Vagrant client? I am new to Ubuntu (having just installed Ubuntu 12.10) and want to start developing with it.

On a LAN each computer is assigned a different IP address each morning. When I installed Kubuntu 12.10 the IP address assigned to the machine was 10.0.0.2, but today it is 10.0.0.1. When I try to connect to http://127.0.0.1 in Firefox I see in the status bar Connecting to 10.0.0.2. However, there is no mention of that address in the /etc/hosts file:\n127.0.0.1       localhost\n127.0.1.1       bruno\n\n# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts\n::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback\nfe00::0 ip6-localnet\nff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix\nff02::1 ip6-allnodes\nff02::2 ip6-allrouters\n\nNote that setting the DHCP server to assign the same IP address per MAC address cannot be done as the router is unplugged each evening (electrical issues in the building) and loses the settings.\n\nA: If http://127.0.0.1 gets redirected to http://10.0.0.2 then it means that the web server listening on 127.0.0.1:80 is doing such redirect.\nSo the fault is not of the TCP stack implementation of Linux, nor is there anything wrong with /etc/hosts. (Do not confuse host names with IP addresses: host names are resolved, IP addresses are not. In other words, there is no way to make 127.0.0.1 \"resolve\" to 10.0.0.2 without using a high-level protocol such as HTTP, which allows redirection from one IP address to another.)\nTry using wget which will give you many useful details. You should see something like the following.\n$ wget http://127.0.0.1\n--2013-01-09 15:55:38--  http://127.0.0.1\nConnecting to 127.0.0.1:80... connected.\nHTTP request sent, awaiting response... 301 Moved Permanently\nLocation: http://10.0.0.2 [following]\n...\n\nOf course, the exact output will vary depending on the situation. However, if you see a similar output, it is evidence that a web server is doing the redirect.\nTherefore, to solve the problem, you should look into your web server configuration.\n\nA: The previous IP address was 10.0.0.2 and now it is 10.0.0.1. If Firefox is now trying to connect to 10.0.0.2 then it must have previously cached that address. Clear Firefox's cache; whatever mechanism previously redirected Firefox from 127.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.2 should now redirect Firefox to 10.0.0.1.\n", "Q: How to I insert a command into a script located on a remote server?

When i update xorg and enable 1 of the 4 posible drivers and restart the screen is becoming small with big icons and this is for every driver i try.\nCan someone help me please.\nAlso many times when i work the screan lag i can not start console, can not move mouse, canot reboot and the only way is \"hard way\" i must coldly turn off my laptop. The question is : Is this a hardware(in windows 2007 i dont have this problem) or software problem and how to solf it?\n\nA: It sounds like for some reason enabling these drivers sets your screen resolution lower. Simply set it to the appropriate resolution using the Displays tool. As for the lagging, if this is an nvidia driver that we are talking about, just search \"nvidia\" in the dash. I think that the application you want is something like \"Nvidia X Server\" and one of the options is to set the graphics to high performance mode. It is made to seem as if when you set to high performance, your graphics quality goes down, but when I set mine to high performance there was no noticeable difference.

Why older kernel?\nFor whatever reason out there, you might be forced to run another kernel than the ones provided by Ubuntu. It may even take you back a few years for a kernel that is compatible with specific precompiled kernel modules, your Xen/container-based VPS provider may force you to use his kernel, etc.\nI have this question for a long time, but this sparked it again today.\nIn such a case it would be very useful to be able to say whether you can blame the kernel for issues or whether you should even bother to try to set up a more recent version of Ubuntu in your situation.\nPolicy, documentation?\nI'm particularly interested in what the objectives of the developers/QA are in this regarding LTS releases and newer stable running the LTS-kernel. Some closely related questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the policy on compatibility with earlier kernel versions? E.g. no bug reports accepted, must work with all kernel versions back to and including previous LTS, etc.\n\n*Example case, practically: How likely will I be in trouble when running Lucid's kernel on Precise?\n\n*To what extent is software relatively close to the kernel (udev, gvfs, mdadm etc.) being tested on other than the version provided with the release?\n\n*How does Desktop/Server edition differ in this?\n\n\nThe most obvious place to look at this would be the Release notes. However, besides updates/changes to the Ubuntu flavoured kernel, this doesn't mention anything about compatibility with other kernels, while kernel-related features are being mentioned in other parts of the notes, e.g.\n\nSoftware RAID now supports bad block management (MD).\n\nIs Ubuntu simply not bothering about these cases or am I missing a resource on this? Besides the release notes, I have used Google to quite some extent using keywords: Ubuntu 12.04 minimal kernel version required and several variants to it. Yet, no statement about it appears to be made on those results. I now find this question popping up as only relevant resource. I did find this answer, tough, and it looks very promising, yet it's about a specific issue/environment and not really about server/desktop usage.\nUserspace vs kernel\nI know most pieces of userland software should not bother about kernel versions, but it's getting more complicated for VPN software or applications interacting with hardware, like the one above, but also for example V4L2, Network Manager, Alsa, etc.\nDebian vs Ubuntu\nDebian is really clear on this. Already for Wheezy, we know that if you rely on udev, it will require 2.6.26 to run properly from it's release notes (in the works):\n\nThe udev version in wheezy requires a kernel of version 2.6.26 or newer with [...]\n\nWhat I'm not asking for\nI am very well aware about the backports provided for newer kernels from newer releases to the current LTS version. This question is about the opposite.\nPlease avoid any discussion like \"why would one want to run an older kernel?\" - you just don't have a choice sometimes and it's not about what we want, but how one can deal with such a given situation.\n\nA: The only officially supported kernel is the one shipped with that Ubuntu release.  If you have issues due to using a different kernel, you will be on your own.  If an issue is suspected to be related to using a non standard kernel, you will be asked to at least test the standard one to see if it actually is related.\nThere are too many potential issues that could result from using an older kernel to have any sort of accurate list of what works and what doesn't; you will just have to try for yourself.\n\nA: \nQUESTION: What is the policy on compatibility with earlier kernel versions? E.g. no bug reports accepted, must work with all kernel versions back to and including previous LTS, etc.\n\nI'm a member of the Ubuntu BugControl team and I can say that only bugs in non-obsolete Ubuntu packages are considered. If you install your own kernel or if you use a package from a different distribution and report a bug, your bug will be invalidated. See these two stock responses:\n\n\n*\n\n*About an obsolete version of the software for reporter's release\n\n*Packages not provided by Ubuntu\nAlso, the Ubuntu Kernel team has a FAQ that you might find interesting:\n\nThe Kernel Team provides support (security updates etc) for the Ubuntu kernels on all currently active releases, we do not support any non-Ubuntu kernels. A full list of the currently active releases can be found on the Releases page. For Long Term Support (LTS) releases the desktop kernels drop from support before the server kernels, this is reflected in the Releases page.\n\nHowever this just says which kernels are supported, not which ones are considered compatible.\n\nQUESTION: Example case, practically: How likely will I be in trouble when running Lucid's kernel on Precise?\n\nThis is a pretty difficult question to answer. Especially because it really depends on what applications/modules you will be using. We can restrict this question to the \"standard\" Ubuntu Desktop or Server, but even then it would be too difficult to answer: there is not enough documentation and the information available are sparse.\nFor example, to check whether udev from Quantal is compatible with the Lucid kernel you would have to see the M, N, O, P, Q release notes, kernel changelogs and udev changelogs. And then proceed to an another package, e.g. libc, upstart and so on. All these packages depend on specific kernel versions and all these packages are not controlled directly by Ubuntu (in the sense that it's not the Ubuntu Team that decides the compatibility policies of that packages).\n\nQUESTION: To what extent is software relatively close to the kernel (udev, gvfs, mdadm etc.) being tested on other than the version provided with the release?\n\nThe Ubuntu Testing team and the Ubuntu Quality team do not test kernels not provided by Ubuntu. The proof is that there are no test cases nor test activities for obsolete kernels.\n\nQUESTION: How does Desktop/Server edition differ in this?\n\nThey do not differ in any way. This is partially proven by the fact that both Desktop and Server edition use the same kernel.\n\nQUESTION: Is Ubuntu simply not bothering about these cases or am I missing a resource on this?\n\nUbuntu is not bothering about these cases. Not supporting a kernel version, but being compatible with it would be just extra work with few benefits.\nWhether one may like it or not, one of the Ubuntu practices is to look forward and try to support the most recent technologies, rather than the most outdated. You can find an example of this when the Ubuntu CD has been dropped in favor of the DVD, or when Unity 2d has been removed from Quantal.\nAlso, and this is the most important point in my opinion, Ubuntu is not interested in distributing software which works, but software which works and is supported. There are important differences between these two terms.\n\nA: Making an educated guess, I don't think older kernels are even considered for any Ubuntu release. ...and why would they be? The 'required kernel' is simply the one a release ships with.\nWhy would one want to use an older kernel on a new release, rather then the older release itself?\nAFAIK, the kernel team looks forward rather then backward. They backport newer kernels from newer releases, for example, Quantal kernels get backported to Precise, but not the other way around.\n", "Q: How to apply a python patch on installed library I have a linux box with root access. I've django library installed as uncompressed python egg. Now I want to install this patch. \nHow can I do it?\n\nA: Use the 'patch' tool to apply your patch. The description provided to you above is likely useful; first move to the django source directory or where ever you've uncompressed your egg, and then run patch (if you don't have patch installed simply do an apt-get install patch). I'd use -p1 as an arg, not sure why -p2 was specified, but my command might look like this;\npatch -p1 --dry-run < name.patch\n\nYou can find out more with 'man patch'.\n", "Q: Slow Samsung 830 SSD! I did a fresh install of Xubuntu 12.04.1, ext4 with discard option & swappiness set to 0, mounting temp directory in RAM, (8GB.)  \nI found performance was not stellar, in fact, marginally better than traditional spinning storage media.  This drive has had good reviews, yet I have seen Windows users complaining of slow performance online.  It was anything other than zippy, with application loads being plain dog slow & not instant like I expected.  I RMAd it eventually (GSmartControl would never complete long test.)\nSlow performance on Windows = slow performance on Linux?  Would I fare better with another brand?\nI now have a 840 & it is not legendary, but faster than HDD.\n\nA: I just succeeded in updating the firmware of my Samsung 840 SSD. I used a libvirt-bin kvm, installing Windows 7 into a 16Gib virtual disk. I plugged in a USB drive, and used the virt-manager to give it to the vm running Windows 7. I installed the Samsung software, and had it make a bootable USB drive. I rebooted the laptop with that USB drive, and it updated the firmware with no problems.\nI have asked Samsung to please provide USB bootable images for Linux users who don't have access to Windows 7... Perhaps if they hear it enough times, they'll do it.\n\nA: Think you answered your own question there, the drivers used to control sata disks are normally pretty generic - unless you are using special hardware - and do the same on both Windows and Linux.\nIf this drive is slow on Windows it will probably also be slow on any Linux system. You should replace it or check if Samsung has a firmware upgrade that would eventually solve this issue.\nRemember when I first changed from a spinning plate drive to a SSD, there is no comparison on boot and applications access. This is a disk model problem and should be handled with Samsung.\n", "Q: Why re-enabled sources are still marked as \"disabled on upgrade to quantal\"? After having a lot of software sources disabled on upgrade to Lubuntu quantal (see question here) I have decided to re-enable most of them, which I did, without problems, except that the note that they were \"disabled on upgrade to quantal\" is still there. \n\nWhy is that, and what does that mean at this point?\n\nA: It is a simple comment that is added by the upgrade procedure, and it does not have special meaning. So you can edit the source and clear the comment. \n\n", "Q: cannot allocate free space, format extended partition I cannot create a partition on free space, neither can I delete the extended partition.\nDisk utility says\nCannot delete extended partition while logical partitions exist\n\n\n\nA: Among those partitions created by you , find which one is logical partition and delete that partition.\nPS: use Gparted instead of using Disk utility.

I would like to use Compound TCP in Ubuntu.\nThe Wikipedia page says:\n\nIn addition to Windows, CTCP was also ported to Linux [...] Since kernel version 2.6.17 the module has been incompatible and fails to compile due to kernel API changes.\n\nIs there a newer implementation that works correctly?\n\nA: Compound TCP by Microsoft is just one implementation of a congestion algorithm protocol. In Linux this has been discarded as you've already found, and it seems that TCP Illinois was the direct successor, but not used that much any more.\nSome work has been done to implement Illinois since 2.6.22: LWN article: TCP Illinois preliminary version. It also seems still available in current versions: net/ipv4/tcp_illinois.c in linux-stable tree.\nTCP New Reno, another alternative based on RFC3782 seems to be the most commonly used in Linux and completely integrated in the kernel. See also the manpage tcp(7):\n\n  tcp_available_congestion_control (String; read-only; since Linux 2.4.20)\n\n\n          Show  a list of the congestion-control algorithms that are registered.

According to a search within git it never came back. So the entry in Wikipedia is right. You have no chance to get it working (until you rewrite the code).\n", "Q: Is this the right way to enable power saving with Bumblebee? I am dual booting. Win7 for the occasional game, and Ubuntu 12.10 for everything else.\nI've got a Nvidia 680m 4GB GPU.

Either way, bbswitch will be used by default. When installing bumblebee-nvidia too, you will just have a bunch of extra files which slows done kernel updates. If you do not need it, do not install it.\n(kernel updates will be slown down because the nvidia kernel module needs to be built.)\n", "Q: How do I undo and install the proprietary GPU driver?

The files on my PC are in sync with my Android tablet via Ubuntu One.\nIf I modify a file on my PC the changes are correctly sync'd to the tablet. However if I modify a file on my tablet, save it and sync it, it does not send the changed file back to the PC.\nI have already checked my settings but couldn't find anything useful to solve this problem.\n\nA: I'm the developer working on Ubuntu One Files. Allow me to assist you.\nUbuntu One Files does not sync your files. It is a thin client that gives you access to Ubuntu One cloud storage. It works quite differently from what you are used to on your desktop machine, due to a number of platform limitations on Android (such as battery, CPU and bandwidth). In other words, you can download and upload your files, none of these actions are automatic. You can also choose to auto-upload pictures, but this is far from a fully functional sync feature.\nWhen the app detects the file has changed on the server, it removes the local file copy, so that you don't access the old file, and download the new one whenever you try to access it. However, if you modify the file, the app will not sync it back to Ubuntu One automatically. You would have to manually select to upload that file to the same location.\nIt is true that you need a file explorer (we currently don't ship a custom one), but it doesn't need to be File Expert. Actually, I suggest you give these a try:\n\n\n*\n\n*ES File explorer (the \"File way\" when you choose to share a file)\n\n*ASTRO file explorer\nYou can use any file explorer of your choice, which properly shares a raw path of the chosen file (that's a technical bit, but there are a few file explorers that share content in an unsupported way with content:// URIs).\nThat said, if you change a file, you would have to open Ubuntu One Files, browser to the destination directory, hit plus at the top, select File, and choose the file you have modified. The file will overwrite the copy on the server once uploaded.\nEDIT: It is true that Ubuntu One stores your files under SD_card_path/u1/ directory.\n\nA: As far as I know the Ubuntu One File app for android does not do two-way sync. It only downloads the changed files from the server when you click on them.\nTo upload a file from the tablet you have to use a file management app like File Expert.\nFor example: \nIn File Expert, drill down to SD Card > u1 > Ubuntu One or whatever folder has your file.\nSelect the file you have changed and choose Share and then choose Ubuntu One File. The file will get uploaded to Ubuntu One server.\nNote: File Expert can be setup to directly work with Ubuntu One server without going through the Ubuntu One Files app. However, I have not tested that functionality of File Expert.\nAlso see: How to use File Expert to select a file for upload in ubuntu-one on android?\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: How to convert DVD to WMV (or another format acceptable by Windows Movie Maker)?

I am trying to find all JPG images within a folder with subfolders that have either width or height below 300px.\nThis way I want to detect old thumbnails and delete them.\nFor sure I can find all images using find:\nfind . -iname \"*.jpg\" -type f | ...\n\nBut what follows after the pipe? Which package can I use to detect picture attributes?\n\nA: You can use identify from imagemagick, and you can use the following command:\nfind . -iname \"*.jpg\" -type f -exec identify -format '%w %h %i' '{}' \\; | awk '$1<300 || $2<300'\n\nthe use of -exec <command> '{}' \\; makes sure that your filename can have spaces in them, alternatively you can use\nfind . -iname \"*.jpg\" -type f | xargs -I{} identify -format '%w %h %i' {} | awk '$1<300 || $2<300'\n\nwhere the -I{} takes care of the same thing. \nWhat I like about identify is that you can specify the output format; in this case '%w %h %i' which gives the width, height and full pathname of the image. Then the awk expression only keeps those lines for which the image is smaller than the desired size.\nExample of the output:\n64 64 ./thumbsup.jpg\n100 150 ./photomin.jpg\n\nEdit: If you want the filenames only (for piping to rm for instance), simply change $line in the awk statement to $3, then it will only print the third column.\n\nA: This worked for me:\nfind . -iname \"*.png\" -type f -exec identify -format '%i %wx%h\\n' '{}' \\; | grep '75x75'\n\nThis is the output sample:\n./2520161636481000.png 75x75\n./2620160819191100.png 75x75\n./2420181545550700.png 75x75\n\n\nA: I think the accepted answer is very good, but I wanted to add another possible solution ... \nAlthough I use ImageMagick tools most often now myself, netpbm is an old friend for processing images. You can see the size of any format of image with the command:\nanytopnm file | pamfile\n\nThis will generate output that looks like:\nstdin:  PPM raw, 1650 by 1275  maxval 255\n\nTo answer the question of \"what follows after the pipe?\", I use while read more often than I use xargs because it is more flexible. My netpbm answer to the question looks like this:\nfind -iname \\*.jpg | while read img; do \\\n  anytopnm \"$img\" | pamfile | \\\n    perl -ane 'exit 1 if $F[3]<300 || $F[5]<300' || rm -v \"$img\"; \\\ndone\n\n\nA: The identify command from the imagemagick package does what you want:\n$ identify abc.jpg\nabc.jpg JPEG 1952x3264 1952x3264+0+0 8-bit DirectClass 1.111MB 0.000u 0:00.000\n\nAgain, you would need to then use grep to sort out the image size.\nHowever, I suspect that unless you have a very wide range of image sizes, it would be easier just to use find to remove JPEG files below a given size:\nfind -iname '*.jpg' -size -10k -delete\n\n(Worth running without -delete first to check it doesn't find things you want to keep - it won't prompt you before deletion otherwise).\n", "Q: Ubuntu One indicator applet not showing in XFCE I have recently installed the Xubuntu desktop alongside Ubuntu on my netbook, as it's lighter.

I have OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard (w install disk)\n\n\n*\n\n*50Gbs was my personal choice. This is really up to you\n\n\n*Install rEFIt and test that it works. You should see it after a restart with some boot options.\n\n*Install Ubuntu desktop using the amd64+mac iso. rEFIt should let you boot from the disk.\n\n\n*\n\n*I put this at the end of the drive (20Gbs) with the intent of removing it. You may be able to get by using a LiveCD but I had already installed it to explore other options.\n\n\n*Within Ubuntu (select it via rEFIt), create a partition (1Gb) using gparted and then copy the Ubuntu 64-bit Server iso to it. For simplicity, let's say we now have /dev/sda6/ubuntu.iso\n\n*Restart and select Ubuntu again, this time before Ubuntu loads access the GRUB2 command line by pressing c when the GRUB menu appears. Type the following:\nloopback loop (hd0,6)/ubuntu.iso\nlinux (loop)/install/vmlinuz boot=install iso-scan/filename=/ubuntu.iso quiet splash --\ninitrd (loop)/install/initrd.gz\nboot\n\n\n*You should now be entered into the Ubuntu Server install process.

(see the apt-get autoremove part)\n\n\nYour GPU is supported by the open source driver radeon, which has proper XRandR support so the Ubuntu integrated tool can do all configuration and you have proper KMS support. This is the recommended driver for your hardware, if I'm correct.\nThe radeonfb kernel module is just part of the regular Linux kernel image and provides very basic framebuffer rendering and communication to the card. I bet if you just remove the CCC and reboot it'll be gone. I suspect the CCC modprobe'd it, but then errored out and didn't bother rmmod'ing it.

How long should the reboot take? I'm attempting to dual-boot my laptop with Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.10. Everything to my knowledge has gone perfectly, up until now. The installation was success. Consequently, the computer began the typical reboot. A black screen appeared with a bunch of esoteric code. It looks like an enumerated list of tasks the PC is trying to complete. Unfortunately, once it got to step 53, it stopped there and hasn't done anything else for the last hour and a half. The computer is obviously still processing something due to how heated it's getting. I'm just concerned that something has gone terribly wrong. Can anyone please help? The text reads:\n[    53.252069]  CR2:  fffffffffffffffffffffff\n\n\"Computer seems to be frozen during reboot after installation. How long should the reboot take?\"\n\nA: If your computer takes more than a couple of minutes, then something is definitely wrong.\nFirst, try to restart again. Does that work? \nIf so, then it may have just been a fluke. It happens sometimes, for various reasons, and often a restart will make everything go smoothly (often, the computer will detect that something didn't go right and will try to fix the cause).\nIf not, does it stop at the same place? \"Step 53\" doesn't tell us anything, and probably isn't a step at all. Take a look at the text of the \"step,\" as well as that of the \"steps\" before it. If it stops at the same place, what is it stopping at/what is the \"step\" before it? That might give an indication as to what's failing.\nDo you have any printers or other USB or external devices hooked up? If so, unplug them and see if it can boot successfully. If it can, reintroduce the devices one at a time until you get it to break again. I've seen instances where a computer won't boot, or takes a long time to boot, due to a USB device (in my case, a printer) causing trouble. This may be due to a faulty cable, faulty port, or you've simply overloaded the power draw of that USB block. Replace cables or move where you have things plugged in as needed to get it to boot again with all devices.\nIf that doesn't work, try reinstalling the OS (if you want to be doubly sure, redownload the ISO, check the MD5 sum, and remake your boot disk). Sometimes, the copy process doesn't copy quite right, for a number of different reasons, and a reinstall fixes things. \n", "Q: How to edit /etc/resolv.conf on Ubuntu 12.04 I have two network interfaces configured via DHCP. As a result, /etc/resolv.conf is populated with information coming from the DHCP server.\nHow can I edit this file?\nI know that if I add prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1 to /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf I can obtain nameserver 127.0.0.1 as the first (and only) line of /etc/resolv.conf.\nWhat if I want 127.0.0.1 and only one of the two nameserver addresses provided via DHCP?\n\nA: In Ubuntu 12.04 and later, /etc/resolv.conf is dynamically generated by the resolvconf utility. (Actually, resolvconf generates /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf and /etc/resolv.conf is a symbolic link to that. That's the default configuration; it is also possible to run with a static file at /etc/resolv.conf but that is non-standard.) Nameserver information (nameserver addresses and search domain names) gets registered with resolvconf by interface configurers (ifup, NetworkManager, dhclient, etc.). On the basis of what has been registered, resolvconf generates an up-to-date resolv.conf file.\nTherefore, you can't edit the resolv.conf file directly. If you want to control what ends up in resolv.conf you will have to configure the resolvconf utility. Please see the resolvconf documentation for more information.\nThe answer to the specific question \"What if I want 127.0.0.1 and only one of the two nameserver addresses provided via DHCP?\" is:\n\n\n*\n\n*First, do not add prepend domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1 to /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf.  The correct protocol is for local nameservers to register their local listen address(es) with resolvconf when they are ready to provide local name service; when they do this there is no need for DHCP clients to do so too. Dnsmasq does the right thing by default. In the case of BIND 9, you have to set RESOLVCONF=yes in /etc/default/bind9 to cause it to register the address 127.0.0.1 with resolvconf.\n\n*Second, resolvconf by default truncates the list of nameservers after any loopback address such as 127.0.0.1. To disable this behavior, create a file /etc/default/resolvconf containing the line TRUNCATE_NAMESERVER_LIST_AFTER_LOOPBACK_ADDRESS=no.\n\n*Third, resolvconf by default truncates the list of nameservers after three items. There is no point in including more addresses because the glibc resolver ignores any addresses after the first three. To cause resolvconf to truncate the list after two addresses you have to edit the script /etc/resolvconf/update.d/libc to replace this line\n[ \"$N\" = 3 ] && return 0\n\nby the following one.\n    [ \"$N\" = 2 ] && return 0\n\n\nA: It worked for my grandfather, it worked for my father and it works for me.\nrm /etc/resolv.conf\nvi /etc/resolv.conf\n\nsearch yourdomain.com\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\nnameserver 8.8.4.4\n\nEDIT:\nrm removes the standard symbolic link.\nvi creates an actual file in its place.\n\nA: When I installed 12.04 this text helped me a lot: http://www.stgraber.org/2012/02/24/dns-in-ubuntu-12-04/\n\nA: For the record, the official resolvconf documentation is here http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=resolvconf/resolvconf.git;a=blob;f=README;hb=HEAD\n\"Editing\" is as simple as using the resolvconf command line like an api.\ne.g.\necho nameserver 8.8.8.8 | resolvconf -a eth0.goog\n\nHere the . is a separator and the part after the interface is the name of the config for that interface.\nAnd if you want to remove this name server just name the interface and configuration and use -d to delete\nresolvconf -d eth0.goog\n\nIn a server/cloud scenario, this is all you need.

I started developing it as a replacement for QJoyPad but there are some features that AntiMicro has that QJoyPad lacks. Some of the more noteworthy features are that multiple keys can be assigned to one controller button (Shift+Tab), macros allow for conditional button presses, set integration for changing button configurations on the fly, and the program uses a tray icon that works properly under Unity.\nThe project is hosted on GitHub and the latest deb files can be found at my website.\nhttps://github.com/Ryochan7/antimicro\nhttp://www.ryochan7.com/files/projects/antimicro/antimicro_0.7-1_amd64.deb\n\nA: Clear alternatives are joy2key, which is available in the repositories, and rejoystick, which I discuss further below.\n1) Fixing compilation problems\nHowever, I believe it is possible to sort out your compilation problems with qjoypad now that you have posted the error messages. It is worth trying to get it compiled as you may find the QT interface much easier to use than the command-line one of joy2key.\nYour error message suggests that you need libxtst6 and libxtst-dev, which have been in the repositories for the last 6 Ubuntu releases. So please run\nsudo apt-get install libxtst6 libxtst-dev\n\nIf you have any further errors you may need to ensure that you have the QT development libraries installed, as they are necessary for building the interface.\nsudo apt-get install libqt4-dev\n\nMore information is detailed in my answer here, which explains how to compile qjoypad and then set up your joystick.\n\n2) Alternatives\na) joy2key \nIn the package description, it is noted that\n\njoy2key allows one to choose keyboard events for joystick axes and buttons,\n   so that a joystick or gamepad can be used with an application that doesn't\n   have native joystick support.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no gui (or none that I know of) that yet exists for joy2key, so an essential read is man joy2key and, for example, this and other threads on Ubuntuforums, which go into detail as to how to set it up, although it can be tricky to get it right.\nEven though you can save your joy2key configuration in .joy2keyrc; it is difficult to share configurations, as the joystick needs calibrating properly on your machine. However, you may be able to find some layouts for your joystick/gamepad on other forums if you face problems setting your own up.\nb) Rejoystick\nIf you have problems with joy2key, rejoystick would probably be better, as it has a gui (see screenshot) that you use to setup your joypad (see screenshot). You can install the deb from sourceforge. You connect your joypad, launch the settings gui by entering rejoystick in terminal, and then you enter your settings and click ok to save the profile  to ~/.rejoystickrc. Then you just run rejoystick -d before you launch your game; enter killall -s SIGKILL rejoystick to clear the current bindings in effect. It does seem to work, but I'm not sure if you can have different profiles like you can with qjoypad.\n\nIn short, I highly recommend trying the solutions given further above to solve the compiling problems with qjoypad, as joy2key can be a pain to get set up correctly, although rejoystick is much simpler and may be useful.\n\nA: If you want to try other DEB or APT:\nsearch for qjoypad at http://www.ubuntuupdates.org/\nthe DEB there install fine without need to compile!\n", "Q: Installing software on Lubuntu without a browser I have installed Lubuntu without a browser.

My standard programming mode is to have a bash shell open on the left side of my desktop and to have emacs open on the right side. However, when I type emacs \"filename\" in to my shell, it comes up on the left side by default. Anyway I can change this? Thanks!\n\nA: It's quite straightforward to do this (even though it should be on the right side by default): all you need to do is to experiment with the --geometry option when launching a file. Apart from specifying the size of the emacs window, you can specify offsets to determine window position. It is well explained at the official site:\n\nIn the ‘--geometry’ option, {+-} means either a plus sign or a minus sign. A plus sign before xoffset means it is the distance from the left side of the screen; a minus sign means it counts from the right side. A plus sign before yoffset means it is the distance from the top of the screen, and a minus sign there indicates the distance from the bottom.\n\nSo, if we want to launch emacs top-right, we run:\nemacs file.txt --geometry '-3+3'\n\nOther options such as bottom-left would be '+3-3', etc.\nYou could just put the above line in your .bashrc as an alias if you want it to launch it like this everytime:\nalias emacs='emacs --geometry '-3+3''\n\nAfter adding the alias, you have to run . .bashrc to source your .bashrc or restart the terminal for it to take effect.\n(At any point you can launch emacs with command emacs to run it as normal and the alias will be ignored.) \n\nA: Various programs respect or disrespect the -geometry flag. Mik's solution happens to not work for me, though your mileage may vary. If it doesn't work for you, you could install the devilspie package. Then make a ~/.devilspie directory and make a file ~/.devilspie/emacs.ds with this content:\n( if\n  ( matches ( application_name ) \"emacs\" )\n  ( begin    \n    ( focus )\n    (geometry \"755x970+840+0\")\n  )\n)\n\nYou will of course have to edit the numbers in (geometry \"755x970+840+0\") to something appropriate for your monitor resolution.\nFinally, go to Applications>Other>Startup Applications and add devilspie to the programs to run upon startup.\nAlthough this adds an extra dependency, this allows you to have one unified system for controlling the placement of all your applications, (e.g. gnome-terminal, firefox, etc), without having to learn/fight with each application's -geometry or configuration quirks. devilspie also works well with a variety of window managers.\n", "Q: How can I set up a bluetooth mouse without using a mouse? I have a Mac Mini with an Apple Magic Mouse bluetooth mouse. In order to set up a bluetooth mouse, though, it looks like you have to use a mouse. Doesn't that completely defeat the purpose? Is there a way I can set up my bluetooth mouse using the commandline? \n\nA: I'm not really sure if you can do it in a terminal, but with my iMac I used tabbing instead.\nTabbing is just that, pressing Tab all the time until you highlight the button that you want to \"click\", of course, using Space.\nI would recommend you to get an USB Mouse, anyway here you have some steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot ubuntu.

Please be patient with my explanation because I wrote it with a brand new person to Linux in mind. I have fallen in love with Linux and wish for other \"newbies\" to do the same :) \nFor someone converting from windows... powerful \"sudo\" commands that are entered without understanding of their meaning... may quickly lead to a fresh re-install of one's favorite flavor of Linux. I speak from experience. If you are new to Linux, especially switching from Windows, it is important to know that not all hardware is compatible and to make it even more interesting, Linux “distros” are also not equal. I am currently using Linux Mint 17.1 KDE, which is more or less a derivative of Canonical's Ubuntu. For example, if you didn't know, most HP printers are recognized immediately and effortlessly within Linux because of the the wonderful HPLIP opensource project. Just connect and turn on your HP printer, then go to printer settings within Ubuntu or Linux mint 17.1 and simply add your HP printer (which should be already listed). \nA little research first will definitely save a huge headache later. :) \nI tried using my Insignia Bluetooth Receiver in the past, but had no luck on Mint or Ubuntu, while my newly bought Kensington Bluetooth 4.0 dongle #K33956AM was recognized and paired seamlessly with my other devices. It was able to list the exact device name along with the MAC address. Unfortunately, I had NO SOUND. :( I double checked it was not my system. My computer played the music file normally though my built-in analog stereo hardware. :( \nI read what the awesome and helpful people stated above, but went though the graphical interface instead of using the terminal (I've used windows for the past 20 years, what can I say... LOL) I went to System Settings/Multimedia/Audio and Video Settings and discovered my Analog stereo hardware received priority over my Bluetooth hardware. I first attempted to change the priority of the devices within the \"Audio Playback Device Preference for 'Music' Category\" but this did not fix my sound. \nTHEN I DISCOVERED THE SOLUTION TO MY PROBLEM... I changed the priority of devices in the \"Audio Playback Device Preference for 'Video' Category\" and BINGO!!! :) :) :) This worked perfectly. For some reason the video setting also controls the music. I changed all pertinent settings to make my Bluetooth have priority and have not had any further issues since that point.

My device is called \"Avi Ear\" and it was found in the line:\n\n*\n\n*[CHG] Device 4C:87:5D:9E:04:B8 Name: LE-Avi Ear\n\n\n\n*From the above output, we know that my device's MAC address is 4C:87:5D:9E:04:B8.\n\n\n\n*Now that we have the MAC address, we can connect to the device with the following bash script AFTER replacing my MAC address with yours:\n\n*\n\n*Important: Before running the script, make sure your device is bluetooth discoverable by pressing some button on the device.\n\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n# remove headphones and start fresh\nbluetoothctl remove 4C:87:5D:9E:04:B8\n# turn bluetooth off\nbluetoothctl power off\n# turn blutooh on\nbluetoothctl power on\n# scan for devices for 15 secs so that our device gets discovered.\ntimeout 15s bluetoothctl scan on\n# pair with headphones\nbluetoothctl pair 4C:87:5D:9E:04:B8\n# trust headphones\nbluetoothctl trust 4C:87:5D:9E:04:B8\n# connect to headphones\nbluetoothctl connect 4C:87:5D:9E:04:B8\n\n\n*\n\n*Finally, you should see headphones in the \"Connected\" state in Bluetooth Settings. For example, as you can see in the image below,  \"Avi Ear\"(Name of my headphones) is \"Connected\".\n\nConfigure your computer to output to your headphones\nEven though my headphones were shown as connected, I did not hear any sound. To hear sound you need to:\n\n*\n\n*Open the PulseAudio Volume Control App. This came preinstalled  with Ubuntu for me, but you should be able to find easy instructions to install if you don't have it.\n\n*Go to the Configuration tab and make sure you have all other devices turned off except your headphones like this:\n\nYou should now be able to hear sounds from your headphones now.\n", "Q: Postfix will not receive emails My Postfix setup does not receive emails from anywhere other than the localhost (sendmail).\nI can log in and send emails from my server, but nothing comes in.\nHere is my postconf -n\nalias_database = hash:/etc/aliases\nalias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases\nappend_dot_mydomain = no\nbiff = no\nbroken_sasl_auth_clients = yes\nconfig_directory = /etc/postfix\ncontent_filter = amavis:[127.0.0.1]:10024\ndisable_vrfy_command = yes\ninet_interfaces = all\nmailbox_size_limit = 0\nmessage_size_limit = 0\nmydestination =\nmydomain = dangersalad.com\nmynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128\nmynetworks_style = host\nmyorigin = /etc/mailname\nreadme_directory = no\nreceive_override_options = no_address_mappings\nrecipient_delimiter = +\nrelayhost =\nsmtp_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtp_scache\nsmtp_use_tls = yes\nsmtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP $mail_name\nsmtpd_delay_reject = yes\nsmtpd_helo_required = yes\nsmtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit_sasl_authenticated, permit_mynetworks, reject\nsmtpd_sasl_auth_enable = yes\nsmtpd_sasl_local_domain =\nsmtpd_sasl_security_options = noanonymous\nsmtpd_sender_restrictions = permit_sasl_authenticated, permit_mynetworks, reject\nsmtpd_tls_cert_file = /etc/ssl/private/mail.mydomain.com.crt\nsmtpd_tls_key_file = /etc/ssl/private/mail.mydomain.com.key\nsmtpd_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtpd_scache\nsmtpd_use_tls = yes\nvirtual_alias_maps = mysql:/etc/postfix/maps/alias.cf\nvirtual_gid_maps = static:5000\nvirtual_mailbox_base = /var/spool/mail/virtual\nvirtual_mailbox_domains = mysql:/etc/postfix/maps/domain.cf\nvirtual_mailbox_limit = 0\nvirtual_mailbox_maps = mysql:/etc/postfix/maps/user.cf\nvirtual_uid_maps = static:5000\n\nAnd here is the error in the log\nJan  9 19:14:06 mail postfix/smtpd[2389]: connect from mail-ie0-f171.google.com[209.85.223.171]\nJan  9 19:14:07 mail postfix/smtpd[2389]: NOQUEUE: reject: RCPT from mail-ie0-f171.google.com[209.85.223.171]: 554 5.7.1 <paul.dangersalad@gmail.com>: Sender address rejected: Access denied; from=<paul.dangersalad@gmail.com> to=<paul@dangersalad.com> proto=ESMTP helo=<mail-ie0-f171.google.com>\nJan  9 19:14:07 mail postfix/smtpd[2389]: disconnect from mail-ie0-f171.google.com[209.85.223.171]\n\nAny advice?\n\nA: This behaviour is created by the lines\nsmtpd_sender_restrictions = permit_sasl_authenticated, permit_mynetworks, reject\n\nand\nmynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 [::ffff:127.0.0.0]/104 [::1]/128\n\nDon't (repeat don't) just remove reject! \nI advise against running any publicly accessible mail server unless you are already experienced with managing those beasts.

These make packages available to you that aren't part of Ubuntu.\nIf you don't want this, you can disable the PPA by looking in /etc/apt/sources.list and/or /etc/apt/sources.list.d for the appropriate entry, and either removing or commenting it out. Then Update Manager should work correctly again.\nIf you do want the PPA enabled, then the easiest way to fix the problem is to remove the entry as above, and then adding it again using the add-apt-repository command. This command both adds the PPA and automatically and securely retrieves and enables the correct key.\nAlternatively, you can get the key from here. Save that (the part including and between BEGIN PGP... and END PGP...) to a file and import it using sudo apt-key add <filename>.

Where is this started up, and is it safe to make changes to that start-up script, or is it better left alone to avoid breaking other stuff?\nMany thanks.\n\nA: Since default desktop sharing in ubuntu is facilitated by vino-server, you should likely disable or remove this first, then install your vnc4server. \nIf you launch vnc4server as a daemon you can edit the script in /etc/init.d OR you can just put a line in rc.local to launch it with whatever commandline options you wish at boot.\n", "Q: The command 'which cd' prints nothing in 12.04 The command which cd prints nothing.

The general thinking is right, but with a wrong realization.\nBelow I'll try to give a simple example:\nFor a start, we need to build a topology of the user directory:\n\n /home (ro)\n   |-someuser (rw,700)\n         |-ftp_upload (ro,555)  - ch_rooting here, required read-only by vsftpd :(\n           |-temp (rw,755)\n           |-in_box (rw,755)\n           |-out_box (rw,755)\n\n\nvsftpd.conf cut:\n\n# Enable chrooting\nchroot_local_user=YES\n\n# chroot all users except listened inside chroot_list\nchroot_list_enable=YES\n\n# Exception list. Ideally, it should be blank ;)\nchroot_list_file=/etc/vsftpd/chroot_list\n\n# Map ftp root directory to specific directory\nlocal_root=/home/someuser/ftp\n\nThis configuration works great with a single-user configuration. For multi-user, the \"user_config_dir\" directive should be used additionally.\n**UPDATE 20/09\n------**\nHere is tricky workaround, not best idea to use, but....\nIf u need writable ftp root folder, just insert  permission change commands in pre-start and post-start commands.\n\n\n*\n\n*Pre-start - change permissions to read-only, which the server requires (:\n\n*Start server\n\n*Post-start - change permission to read-write, or which you need.\n\nA: For VSFTPD 3,\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to: /etc/vsftpd.conf\n\n*and add this:\nallow_writeable_chroot=YES\n\nJust add it if it does not exist yet.\n\n*Restart the vsftpd service:\nservice vsftpd restart\n\nAnd it should work.\n\nA: It's pretty much what toastboy70 mentioned. Make ftp-root dir chown'd to ftp.ftp and non-writable (/etc/vsftpd.conf):\nanon_root=/srv/ftp\nThen make a writable child dir: /srv/ftp/upload\n\nA: The simple fix is to do as the error message suggests: make the root non-writable and then if you need to enable uploads, make a subdirectory which does have write permission. No config changes necessary.\n\nA: The real solution of this problem: the home folder of the user should not be writable only readable.\nSo, if user site is in the folder is cat/example.com/http/, folder cat must have chmod 555 and all will be OK.\n\nA: After further review of this post, in the comments a package was posted that fixed my issue.

How can I use a disk with GPT partition table on a system with a BIOS but no (U)EFI?\nI have a system with a 3 TB drive (no other drives and since this is a remote machine I have no choices here) and with a GPT for obvious reasons. Ubuntu 12.04 is being bootstrapped onto the system and this worked so far. Now after bind-mounting /dev, /proc and /sys from the host into the target system and chrooting into it, I installed linux-image-server which worked fine (after linking /sbin/initctl as /bin/true). Because this is a remote machine I have to do all of this via SSH and have no bootable CD or anything. I can boot into a rescue system if it fails, though (PXE).\nNow I know that grub2 is supposed to support the scenario, but for the life of me I cannot figure out how to install it.\nThe boot (and root) device is to be /dev/md0, composed of /dev/sda1 and /dev/sdb1 in RAID mode 0. With /dev/md0 mounted under /target I am running:\ngrub-install --root-directory=/target --no-floppy /dev/sda\n\nwhich fails with:\n/usr/sbin/grub-setup: warn: This GPT partition label has no BIOS Boot Partition; embedding won't be possible!.\n/usr/sbin/grub-setup: error: embedding is not possible, but this is required when the root device is on a RAID array or LVM volume.\n\nSo how can I get grub2 installed in order to have this BIOS-based system boot properly?\nNote: it doesn't matter whether I run this inside or outside the chroot environment. The error and output are identical. Likely because I bind-mounted /dev etc into place. Of course appropriate adjustments to the command line (no --root-directory=) have been made.\n\nA: You need to create a bios_grub partition on the disk.  You can do this with parted and setting the bios_grub flag on the partition.  1 MiB is sufficient, but it needs to be in the lower 2TiB of the disk.\n", "Q: Every time I restart my computer, an app I use (Synergy) disappears. Running Ubuntu 12.04 If i log in and out or if I restart my computer, Synergy always disappears. I was using the PC a few days ago, got synergy installed and running, and then I rebooted. Synergy didn't start up and I could find it in Applications or recent or even by searching the dash.\nWhen I tried to install it using Ubuntu software center, it shows already installed. So I removed it, reinstalled it and it started working again. At this point I also set it to load on Startup through Synergy settings and also by clicking the gear in the top right and Startup Applications...\nI rebooted again and it's gone again. It's also missing from Startup applications and also from the dash search. I still see in /usr/bin/ synergyc, synergyd, and synergys but none of them run if I double click them (or right-click-> Open).\nCan someone please help me with this?\n\nA: It's a case of getting synergy to autostart after reboots. You're not the first to battle with synergy autostart; googling should bring up many results, and it's been answered here too. I've even blogged about it in the past for gdm3 under Debian. So, you're definitely not alone in your troubles!\nIn summary, getting it to start after you've logged on is just a case of adding the command (synergys/synergyc depending) with appropriate args to Session & Startup's autostart list. There's a little more work to get it autostarting at the point of login, since that's a separate invocation in a separate context, but typically it's just a case of adding the command to the appropriate display manager init file.\nI used to have it autostarting on previous distros, but nowadays I just invoke it manually after logging in, since I reboot infrequently (and the repo version is relatively unstable, so I typically have to restart it periodically anyway).\nA quick synergyc 192.168.x.x does the trick (for the client, obviously).\n", "Q: GParted taking forever I'm trying to install ubuntu 12.10 from DVD. Every time I try, I get an I/O error. I've tried replacing the RAM, with no change.\nI decided I'd try to create a clean HD by booting into liveCD and then running Gparted. However-- gparted just runs with the \"Scanning all devices\" message forever-- though running fdisk -l from the terminal does find the drive fine.\nAny thoughts on what's going on? \n\nA: This usually happens because you have misconfigured your bios to think you have a floppy drive when you don't.

I am trying to find out how long will Ubuntu 13.04 be supported before the next version arrives.\n\nA: According to wiki Ubuntu, 13.04 will be supported until: 2014.10 (October)\nThat's the official support. But Ubuntu get's a new version every 6 months. So next one after 13.04, is in October 2013, called 13.10\n\nA: The ubuntu wiki has a graph for this (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS for more information).\n\nUbuntu also has a 6 months cycle where new releases are release on the 4th and 10th month of the year (hence the 12.04, 12.10, 13.04, 13.10 etc).\n\nA new LTS version is released every 2 years. In previous releases, a Long Term Support (LTS) version had 3 years support on Ubuntu (Desktop) and 5 years on Ubuntu Server. Starting with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, both versions will receive 5 years support. There is no extra fee for the LTS version; we make our very best work available to everyone on the same free terms. Upgrades to new versions of Ubuntu are and always will be free of charge. \n\n\nA: 13.04 is only supported until January 2014? That's unfortunate. I was hoping to skip 13.10.\nSince, from 13.10, it is no longer possible to move an installation to new hardware (motherboard), I have to stick to 13.04. There are also some other annoyances in 13.10 (e.g., Nautilus).\nBut,if no support anymore, I may have to install 12.04. which means a major effort.\n", "Q: Ubuntu/Kubuntu 12.10 and nvidia optimus which drivers to use O.K.

The former will use the binary drivers, which have better performance but are not open source.\n\n*Check this page to see how to test if the aquarium WebGL page gives you better performance: https://launchpad.net/~hybrid-graphics-linux\n\n*Yes. CUDA and Optimus are independent. If your card has CUDA cores and you have the CUDA libraries installed, you should be able to use them when the card is switched on regardless of the drivers you use.\n\n*NVIDIA provides binary drivers but they don't spend as many resources on them as they do on their bigger markets: Microsoft, Android and OSX.

The web app loads perfectly from any computer in the web. I do have the problem that I cant access the internet from the server itself, I open the web browser and does not load, but yet the server is accessible from the web, maybe this is a configuration from my ISP, Ive been looking for an explanation but still havent found one. Maybe here I cant get an appropiate answer.\nAnyways, thats not the real problem. The problem is that I need to load a lot of data to the webapp, and I would like to do it locally through the LAN.

You'll lose all log files across reboots, including the directories packages are expected to be there. If for example /var/log/cups/ does not exists, you'll probably first have to re-create the directory before you can print anything and Cups can't even burp the errors in the meantime...\n/var/log/apt on another tmpfs inside one? This does not make sense.\nAbout /var/tmp and /tmp, I find this a nice explanation:\n\nSince in most of the default installations the /tmp folder will be cleaned in every reboot. This is where /var/tmp comes in to play. Here, applications can expect their data to be preserved between reboots. In other words, data stored here is more persistent than /tmp.\n\nSo, stuff will probably break. Applications rely on the persistence of /var/tmp.\nCommon sense\nDon't just do stuff people or blog posters recommend you to do.\n", "Q: Error code 5 when installing Im using a single core 2.8Ghz pc with 1Gb ram and 400Gb harddrive.\nOn installing either 12.10 or 12.04 I get an Error Code 5 input / output error halfway through the install.\nI have tried 5 CD's of different speeds 3 hard drives (although I want to use the 400Gb one) 2 different CD rom drives and 2 different IDE cables.\nAfter reading through the forum I have booted Ubuntu into \"try it\" mode and accessed the disk utility which confirms the harddrive is healthy.

Presently in the install (USB stick) for 32-bit Ubuntu 12.04.1.  Want to have dual-boot capabilities between Windows 7 and Ubuntu.  Have partitioned hard drive with Windows System (sda1), Windows OS (sda2), Ubuntu (sda3 - with ext4 file system and a \"/\" mount point), swap (sda4) and need to know what file system to select for the remaining free space (storage) partition with a /home mount point?  I presume it to be either FAT32 or ext4, yet I need to be sure that it enables cross-sharing of documents/directories with both Windows 7 and Ubuntu operating systems.  Also, is FAT32 an NTFS type of system?  Thanks in advance.\n\nA: I don't suggest to use NTFS in Linux, because I found Linux support on NTFS is very poor, its file reading and writing speed is extremely slow. So if you don't need want to use huge files, just use Fat32 or ExtFat.\n\nA: Since Windows systems support FAT32 and NTFS \"out of the box\" (And only those two for your case) and Linux supports a whole range of them including FAT32 and NTFS, it is highly recommended to format the partition or disk you want to share in either FAT32 or NTFS, but since FAT32 has a file size limit of 4.2 GB, if you happen to work with huge files, then it is better you use NTFS.\nJust to add, if you do it with another type of partition like ext4, btrfs or any other that Windows does not support natively then the files will work in Ubuntu but not in Windows. Heck, in Windows if you try to access that drive it will offer an option to format the drive to NTFS. So this is the reason to stick with either FAT32 or NTFS.\nYou can actually do this from Ubuntu if you want using for example GPARTED which is found in the Software Center or the Disks utility which comes installed by default.\nI even wrote an answer to the support NTFS has in Ubuntu. So no matter which one you decide, both will be supported between both systems and you can have a shareable partition/disk between Ubuntu and Windows.\nFor several security and performance related issues, /home should never be FAT32 or NTFS. For your case, you should create another partition (Either by taking free space not used by files from an already created partition or using another hard drive) and THIS partition should be the one that is formatted as FAT32/NTFS. This partition will also be the one that will share the information between both, Windows and Ubuntu, not /home. At the end it should look something like this:\nHARD DRIVE 1\n/sda1 - Windows (NTFS, FAT32)\n/sda2 - Swap\n/sda3 - Ubuntu (EXT4)\n/sda4 - Shared partition between Ubuntu and Windows (NTFS or FAT32 Format)\nThis is just a rough sketch but I think it will give you the idea on how to make it so they share each other. If you happen to have 2 hard drives then:\nHARD DRIVE 1\n/sda1 - Windows (NTFS, FAT32)\n/sda2 - Swap\n/sda3 - Ubuntu (EXT4)  \nHARD DRIVE 2\n/sdb1 - Shared partition between Ubuntu and Windows (NTFS or FAT32 Format)\n\nA: Set it as NTFS, since both Ubuntu and Windows will be able to read and write to and from the partition. Ext4 isn't natively recognized by Windows, so don't try that. NTFS has several improvements over FAT32, which (for instance) will not let you have a file over 4GB in size.\n", "Q: How to use wired and wireless interfaces simultaneously?

I'm building a render farm and wanted to use it like a little server for my home.\nThe main question is: What is better? Install ubuntu server and then install the desktop from apt-get to get an interface or install the desktop edition and then install mysl, php and others?\nSince the desktop edition has more latency since the 250 interrupts in the kernel and the server edition has only 100 interrupts in the kernel.\n\nThe server kernel is set to a timer interrupt rate of 100 Hz (CONFIG_HZ=100, CONFIG_HZ_100=y), which means it accepts 100 interrupts per second. Another way to think of this is the kernel looks up and peers around 100 times per second for something to do. The desktop kernel is set to 250 Hz — lower numbers equal lower overhead and higher latency; higher numbers equal higher overhead and lower latency. Higher numbers generally mean the system feels more responsive, at the price of higher CPU usage. Some processes require more interrupts; for example, video processing and VoIP servers need 1000 Hz. If you need to change the Hz value it requires a kernel re-compile. \n\nMore info: The render farm consist in multiple machines. The a master node with hard drive and the other nodes will boot using lan (PXE).\nHave in mind that the main archieve is build a render farm.\nThanks!\nSource: http://www.serverwatch.com/tutorials/article.php/3715071/Ubuntu-Server--Kernel-Configuration-Considerations.htm\n\nA: If you are building alot of machines are you better off starting with server and work your way up \"for a render farm\". Also kernels in the repository are quite interchangeable meaning you can use a server kernel on a desktop and vise verse.\nAlso it never good practice to optimize without taking measurements. I see you are planning ahead however until you have some baseline number you can not determine if latency is an issue or not.\n", "Q: Where is eclipse platform plugin folder?

The intent of this partition is to enable file sharing between Windows 7 and Ubuntu.  Thanks in advance.\n\nA: I think NTFS (using ntfs-3g) does not support Unix permissions. Recording permissions is necessary in the home directory; several programs require correct permissions to function. For instance, for security reasons, OpenSSH requires ~/.ssh to have sufficiently restrictive permissions. If you try to store it on NTFS, it will lose the permissions, causing SSH to fail.\n\nA: No, most of the system directories including /home must be on fully functioning unix filesystems, which neither fat32 nor ntfs are.\n\nA: I am using /home on a NTFS partition in order to share data with my Windows applications. I am working ubuntu 12.04 lts and up to date don't have any problem.\nI did this: \nI have a NTFS partition for Windows Data on /dev/sda6, but you must use your NTFS partition.

I also installed a fan controller and internal temperature monitor software / fan override on the system and that seemed to help.  \n\nA: I had a similar problem using  Microsoft Mobile Mouse 4000 with Ubuntu 12.04 on a desktop.

I have made a list of steps and would like to know if they're correct. If any of them are incorrect please correct that step as answer.\n1. download ubuntu and save it onto my harddrive as an iso file. \nI'm confused about how to save it as an iso.\n2. Then turn off my computer and turn it back on.\n3. From the dos menu, press f2 or f12 and tell the computer to boot from the usb.\n4. then install linux.\nI'm running an Asus laptop.  With an intel core tm15\nIt also has windows 8 beta with an option between windows 7. \nif any of my information is incorrect please tell me. Thank you for your kindness and patience\n\nA: First I must warn you: on the average thumb drive, Ubuntu will run VERY SLOWLY the way you wish to install it. It is also likely that you will run out of space very quickly (I happen to have installed and attempted to use Ubuntu in this very same way once).\nOk, so the first thing you need is two thumb drives (yes, two): one to run as a live usb and one to install onto (this one will need to be at least 5 GB).\nSo first, create an Ubuntu live usb on the first flash drive. Plug both flash drives into your computer and boot to the one that is the live usb (if you can't determine which that is, pull out the one that isn't and then plug it back in once you have booted).\nOnce the live usb boots, click \"Install Ubuntu.\" On the screen asking you to choose to overwrite your current os, install Ubuntu alongside it, or something else, choose something else. This will bring you to a tool which you can use to dedicate partitions to specific purposes in Ubuntu.\nYour hard drive is shown automatically. First make sure that none of these partitions are marked \"swap.\" This happened to me and I lost the swap on my regular Ubuntu installation. Select your thumb drive that you would like to install to from the devices menu. There should be just one big partition on it. Shrink this partition by no more than 1 GB. Then, mark the big partition as the root partition and the small partition as the swap partition.\nWith that done, click continue or next or whatever the button is (sorry, I'm not looking at it right now) and continue with the installation as you would normally.\nThe installer will do the rest of the work after you input just a little more information. It will install Ubuntu onto your flash drive.\nHowever, as I stated above, this will run very slowly and run out of space quickly, no matter how good the computer you are using it on is. I recommend simply making this flash drive into an Ubuntu live usb with the biggest persistence file possible, you should be able to run fine off of that, but a flash drive is still slower than a hard drive.\nI also must include one more warning: this means that your installation is potentially going to be used on multiple machines, so if one specific machine needs something else to run (I am thinking of drivers) Ubuntu, it may render the installation unusable for any machine except the one you installed drivers for.\n", "Q: Is there a way on ubuntu to keep offline files like in windows? In windows there is a option when you browse network folders that copies selected files to local disk. Then you can work with those files, create, modify, delete and when you are in the same network as the origin pc those changes are synced.\nI am talking about 5gb of files, so cloud services are out. \nThis is the scenario:\nI choose files that i need for 2 weeks. I make then available offline. Then i go on a trip, during those two weeks i create new files, delete some files and modify some. I can't keep track manually of changes i made. Then i return home, log in on my laptop and the files are synced with the file server.\nThen i repeat the process buy with different files this time.\nIs there a way to have this feature in ubuntu ?\n\nA: I think you should work with a control version application. Maybe Git. You can create your own server and client in the same computer, but normally is usefull to have it separated to guarantee that you don't lose nothing if the computer breaks.\nTo use and create a git server you can see this instructions.\nBut I sugest you to use Bitbucket ou github to do that job of creating the server. With them you won't have any headache by configuring the server. The first one has the advantage of having private data for free, the second only permits that by paying the service. By the way, I use bitbucket to all sort of things: for my rails projects, for my python applications, for my thesis (MS word, latex and images), and even for my design works that are images and blender videos.\n", "Q: fstab SMB share not mounting with read write access to Windows 8 machine I am using windows 8 and Ubuntu 12.10 and the windows 8 machine is setup as a SMB share. I have read through the man page for cifs-mount, but now matter what I try, I cannot get the share to give me read and write access to the server. Ubuntu will not let me install smbfs as it is obsoleted, so I am unsure where to go from here. The command I am using is\n//theip/Users /media/folder cifs domain=domain,username=user,password=secret,uid=me,rw\n\nThank you!\n\nA: Using Ubuntu 12.10, and connecting to a NAS smb share.  I'd like to clarify that simply adding uid and gid seems sufficient.  I had the following entry in my fstab: \n\n//server_name/share_name  /mount_point  cifs  user=user_name,password=pass_word,rw 0 0\n\nWhen I would right-click, the options for Create New Document and Create New Folder were greyed out.  I could open files, but only Save As was available if I edited, and trying that would throw a permission error.  \nI added the following after my password:\nuid=my_uid,gid=my_gid \n\nI was then able to edit the files and create folders as normal.  \n\nA: I must've been very tired when I was dealing with this. I just checked again and the command seemed to work fine when I changed it to\n//theip/Users /media/folder cifs domain=domain,username=me,password=mypass,uid=1000,iocharset=utf8,codepage=unicode,unicode 0 0\n\nI found this on this page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently\n", "Q: Multiple versions of Libcurl? Is it possible to have multiple versions of libcurl installed in Ubuntu?\nFor instance, suppose I have version 1.0 installed, and I download version 1.1, and install it. Is there anyway to keep version 1, and have several applications use version 1?\n\nA: It depends on how upstream works, how you isntall the new version, and what you're trying to do with it, but looking at how libcurl installs certain files, the basic answer is no.\n\nA: It is possible to have multiple version if the ABI changes enough. ie if the so version is bumped enough.\na good example of this is libjpeg8 vs libjpeg62\nlibjpeg8 is actually provided by libjpeg-turbo8.\ndpkg --listfiles libjpeg-turbo8 | grep so\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjpeg.so.8.0.2\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjpeg.so.8\n\nlibjpeg62 is provided by libjpeg62\ndpkg --listfiles libjpeg62 | grep so\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjpeg.so.62.0.0\n/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjpeg.so.62\n\nthis is not the best example because it was the only one I could think of at the time. due to the 8 using turbo, just try to overlook that for now.\neither way 62 is not compatible with 8 hense the difference in so names.\nso it is possible to have different version, but its generally only needed when there is a major ABI change.\nIn your example 1.1 vs 1 is not that big, and more then likely it would be binary compatible. There is a set rule to this though, maybe someone else can add more details that understands it better. \n", "Q: How do I list folders with underscores first? So as pretty much everyone, before using Ubuntu I used a Windows machine, and one of the things I got used to in Windows was to use the underscore as the first character of a folder name as some sort of special marking so that it would be appear first on listing, both in command line and file explorer.\nFor instance, in my eBooks folder (in Windows) looks something like this:\n_read\n      Book1.pdf\n      Book2.pdf\n_reading\n      Book3.pdf\nBook4.pdf\nBook5.pdf\n\nbut in Ubuntu's Nautilus it looks like this:\nBook4.pdf\nBook5.pdf    \n_read\n      Book1.pdf\n      Book2.pdf\n_reading\n      Book3.pdf\n\nWhat is happening is that it is completely ignoring the underscore and it treats \"_read\" as \"read\" and therefore not listing it in first as wished.\nI have tried setting the environment variable LC_COLLATE to C. This helps somehow since it lists the underscore together, but at the end, and not at the beginning.\nThanks.\n\nA: Since you have not specified the locale that you are currently using, this solution assumes that you are using en_US.UTF-8 as your default.\nYou can check this by running the command locale from the command line(Ctrl+Alt+t).\nFor example:\n~ $ locale\nLANG=en_US.UTF-8\nLANGUAGE=en_US\nLC_CTYPE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_NUMERIC=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_TIME=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_COLLATE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MONETARY=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MESSAGES=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_PAPER=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_NAME=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_ADDRESS=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_TELEPHONE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_MEASUREMENT=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_IDENTIFICATION=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\nLC_ALL=\n\nThe variable that affects the sorting order of files is called LC_COLLATE. \nAccording to the Ubuntu help pages, the LC_COLLATE variable determines \"How strings (file names...) are alphabetically sorted. Using the \"C\" or \"POSIX\" locale here results in a strcmp()-like sort order, which may be preferable to language-specific locales.\"\nThe sort order will need to be changed from LC_COLLATE=\"en_US.UTF-8\" to LC_COLLATE=C.\nFrom the command line(Ctrl+Alt+t), enter:\nupdate-locale LC_COLLATE=C\nImportant: You need to log out of your system and then log back in for the changes to take effect. \nRunning the locale command again, it should show that the LC_COLLATE variable has been successfully changed. Running the command ls -l again should reflect this change.\n\nA: caja (and I think Nautilus before it) has an option in Preferences to sort folders before files. Would that help?\n", "Q: What is the command to put the current window in half the screen I want to put the current, active window on one side of the screen.

Also there are VM x86 images you can use. However that is not what you are looking for.\nIn theory though because things are written in java and run off the dalvik jvm .

When I enable wobbly windows,the desktop doesn't work right like on 12.04. The workspace is glitchy when you grab a window and that is distorted when you don't close the window. The right click also has the effect which I think is not suppose to.\n   The close animation does not work right when you are using flash player like on a youtube video or other video based. I was changing the launcher opacity when I noticed the second problem.\n   Is there a way to update or fix these?\n\nA: Unity is not really designed with heavy tweaking in mind, and the version of ships with Ubuntu is heavily patched. I used to modify compiz behavior quite a bit (adding a lot of customization to the tiling behavior + changes to window rules), but it now it breaks stuff pretty badly. It seems like the more compiz is patched (which it is extensively in every release cycle), the more things break when you change the settings. While I am a fan of Unity and enjoy using it very much, it is not a good option for those who would like to deeply modify window manager behavior.\nThis is one of the reasons there was debate in the last release cycle about removing CCSM from the software center entirely and moving it to a PPA only. Tweaking Canonicals version of Compiz simply breaks Unity, and is discouraged.\nIf you turn off the Unity plugin in Compiz, some of the other tweaks become more functional, but another distro would be more suited to getting classic compiz behavior. Unity and normal Compiz should be considered different window managers for all practical purposes.\nIt is also worth noting that the developer of Compiz is no longer working on it so he can focus on his studies and because he believes maintaining a compositing window manager is redundant with Wayland just around the corner. Not sure what Canonical will do after that, but I do recall that they were paying him to put the Compiz functionality required by Unity into plugins that could be ported to Wayland.\nThings do not bode well for the future of wobbly windows under Compiz, though I'm sure someone will implement them in Wayland at some point (still having trouble figuring out why anyone would want to waste system resources and battery life on something like wobbly windows, but I'm sure you have your reasons).\n", "Q: Installing Ubuntu on Asus G75VW (UEFI) I bought an Asus G75VW.  It has the new UEFI BIOS instead of the old style BIOS (1980's) and has Windows 8 preinstalled.\nI cannot get the G75VW to install Ubuntu 12.10 in EFI mode.  I did get Ubuntu to load if I changed the BIOS to CSM and the computer sees and installs Ubuntu in \"legacy mode\".  I attempted boot repair, and Ubuntu will load after 1 minute but as legacy BIOS only.  If I changed the BIOS to UEFI \"Binary is whitelisted\" is displayed and I get a purple screen.\nI want to keep my preinstalled Windows 8 on internal drive bay 1 and install Ubuntu 12.10 on internal drive bay 2, and have the option of booting either one in grub.\nI am a software programmer, but I am very bad at understanding BIOS and partitioning.\n\nA: The purple screen you mention indicates that you've probably booted GRUB 2, but something has gone wrong in loading the kernel or in its early stages of execution. You might be able to find out what's going wrong by changing the boot options to produce a traditional text-mode startup display, but to do that you'll need to get a GRUB menu rather than have it start Linux automatically. IIRC, you can do this by holding the Shift key as GRUB comes up, but I'm a bit foggy on that. This won't solve your problem per se, but it may help you to better diagnose it.\nSome other ideas, which are all more shot-in-the-dark type attempts at repair:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can try using the Ubuntu Boot Repair tool, which can fix some boot problems automatically. Be aware, though, that it takes over the Windows boot loader's slot, which can cause confusion or problems down the road.\n\n*You can disable Secure Boot. This might help because Ubuntu's Secure Boot support is so new and appears to still contain bugs. It's conceivable, but far from certain, that your problems are related to Secure Boot, so disabling it might help.\n\n*You can try installing rEFInd. I recommend doing this from your legacy/BIOS-mode install of Ubuntu. Using rEFInd will require either disabling Secure Boot or installing another version of shim, which is a bit tedious. Using rEFInd gives you two possible ways to recover:\n\n*\n\n*rEFInd can boot a Linux kernel using its own built-in EFI stub loader, which might work better than the way GRUB launches it. Even if it doesn't, you can press the Insert key when you select the Ubuntu (or Linux penguin) icon to get a submenu of options, one of which produces the verbose text-mode boot messages I described earlier.\n\n*If you edit refind.conf, uncomment the scanfor line, and add hdbios to the list of options, rEFInd might give you a BIOS-mode boot option that will enable you to boot Linux in BIOS mode (via a BIOS-mode GRUB) even while Windows boots in EFI mode. This isn't 100% optimal, but it might be good enough.\n\n\n", "Q: How to continue the installation process after freeze?

How can I open and see within a file within a jar file from within Terminal?\nI can use less to print out all the files within the jar file, but how can I open these files?\n\nA: Personally I use jar because it feels more natural, and allows for other operations such as updating contents too. Here are the read commands:\nList contents\njar tf myjar.jar\nExtract contents to pwd\njar xf myjar.jar\nExtract specific file, creating dirs as required\njar xf myjar.jar /foo/bar.class\nExtracting the bytecode itself isn't usually terribly useful though. To make sense of it, you need to decompile it into something readable. \nThere aren't many good java decompilers to choose from. I tend to use JD-GUI, because it's quick and does what I need it to. Frustratingly, its multi-file search functionality never works for me (note that Ctrl+F search-on-the-page is fine). This is no great loss though; you can get it to dump all the sources to disk with Ctrl+Alt+S for perusal with grep/vim/Eclipse etc.\nI install it like this:\nwget http://jd.benow.ca/jd-gui/downloads/jd-gui-0.3.5.linux.i686.tar.gz\ntar xzf jd-gui-0.3.5.linux.i686.tar.gz\nsudo mv jd-gui /usr/local/bin/\nsudo chown root:root /usr/local/bin/jd-gui\nsudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/jd-gui\n\nUsing it goes something like this:\njd-gui myjar.jar\nCtrl+Alt+S; pick your path & save\nAlt+F4\njar xf <path>/myjar.src.zip \n\nNote however that JD-GUI has no CLI interface. If you know of a good CLI decompiler, I'd be very interested to hear of it (there is JAD, but AFAIK that only supports Java < 1.5).\n\nA: Using unzip you can pipe a file from the archive to stdout and then into something else to read it, like:\nunzip -p /path/to/some.jar path/to/file/inside/jar | less\n\nFrom memory unzip is not installed by default so you might need to:\nsudo apt-get install unzip\n\nJeff\n\nA: jar files are really only zip files you can test this by doing.\nfile foo.jar\n\nso to list the files you can simple do.\nunzip -l foo.jar\n\nTo access the files just unzip the file with\nunzip foo.jar\n\nIf you want to extract only one file then append the files after\nunzip foo.jar some/path/in/jar/bar.class\n\nMake sure to use the full path from -l. And keep in mind it will create the same path locally.\n\nA: (No rep points, so have to answer to respond to comments by @Kurro)\nunzip (-p | -c) <jar-file> <file-in-jar>\n\nThe -p and -c options extract the file to standard output; -c gives an extra 2 lines of data at the beginning (which JAR file and which file within the archive).\nI found this extremely convenient for reading the Manifest file or the .xml files.  For the compiled .class files, this is useless, but your friend here is javap:\njavap -classpath <jar-file> <fully.qualified.class.name>    # without the .class suffix\n\nSome useful options are: -c (decompile to Java Assembly), -private to also show private fields, and -verbose for lots of extra information.  If it's a big file, you may want to pipe the output through less.\n", "Q: What is \"Steam\" and how does it work? I've heard Steam is recently available for GNU/Linux. A lot of people are talking about it. What is Steam? What's the fuss all about? Is Steam just for people who develop and play games? What should I know about Steam, as an user of Ubuntu?\nShould I install Steam?\n\nA: If You Are a Developer\nSteam is particularly relevant to:\n\n*\n\n*developers of games already provided through Steam (by Valve),\n\n*developers making mods for those games, and\n\n*game developers planning proprietary software projects (or, potentially, games with proprietary art but FOSS engines). Basically, anything where content whose distribution is restricted by copyright and must be distributed selectively to customers.\n\nIt is interesting and important that Steam is being ported to GNU/Linux. Whether or not a developer should distribute a game over Steam depends on many factors and is a highly subjective question.\nFor End Users: One Simple Question\nFor users, however, it's usually pretty simple to figure out if you might benefit from subscribing to, installing, and using Steam:\nAre there programs you want to run, that are available for your operating system, and that are distributed on Steam?\nIf there are, Steam might be the best and most convenient way to get them. Or, often, there are other alternatives, which you might prefer. This mostly depends on the application, rather than the Steam service itself.\n(The Steam service also has a Subscriber Agreement. Since signing it affects your legal rights, you should make sure you understand it first, and consider your options, as you should when contemplating the use of any service. By the way, this is not legal advice, and I am not a lawyer. I don't work for Valve Corporation either.)\nYou can search here to see what games (and other content) are available through Steam. Just remember that not all games on Steam are necessarily available for your platform (especially if your platform is Linux-based).\nOr browse Steam games currently available for GNU/Linux (that includes Ubuntu).\nCore Concepts\nThere is a saying (which I think might originate in BSD culture, but I'm really not sure):\n\nYou don't use an operating system, you use applications.\n\nAnything you want to use your computer for, you use some program to do it. The program may run on a particular OS, or be provided as part of a particular OS, or have no support on that OS at all. But what matters about an OS is whether or not you can run programs that provide the functionality you need.\nNow, Steam is not an operating system. It is a distribution platform, sort of like the iTunes Music Store, but focused on games instead. Potentially Steam could be used to distribute other software, and it actually is used to distribute some videos.\nIf you want to run software that is distributed through Steam, then you should consider using Steam. Otherwise, though Steam has a few side features--chat with other Steam users--there is really no reason to use Steam.\nYou don't play a distribution platform, you play games.\nThe reason it's big news that Steam is coming to GNU/Linux (such as Ubuntu) is not that Steam is particularly cool itself, but that a number of Steam games formerly available only on other platforms seem to be coming along with it.\nFor example, a Left 4 Dead 2 player who uses Ubuntu may be very happy that Steam is being ported to GNU/Linux, so they can install and play Left 4 Dead 2 it on Ubuntu. But really, Steam being ported to GNU/Linux is just a tiny part of what's beneficial there. The real benefit is that Left 4 Dead 2 is being ported.\nPorts of many other games currently available to Windows and Mac OS X users are planned, too. But many games are distributed on Steam, and some of them will not support multiple platforms (just as some don't now, even though Steam has been out for Mac OS X for quite some time).\nGames run on an operating system, not a distribution platform.\nSteam is an infrastructure for distributing and managing the installation and use of games. It manages user identity information, and it has a (minor) role in providing multiplayer functionality. But it is not a game engine, graphics API, or sandbox in which a game runs.\nWhen Steam runs on Linux, that doesn't make Steam applications run on GNU/Linux. They have to be ported. And if they were ported without Steam, they would run, too.\nPackaging Software ...and Managing It Too!\nPeople can debate the advantages and disadvantages of Steam as a distribution platform; I'm not going to try to do that here. But there's one advantage-disadvantage pair that's important to understanding Steam at all:\n\n*\n\n*Advantage: Your software is available from anywhere. You can download, install, and update it through automated means. You can use it from multiple machines.\n\n*Disadvantage: Your software is tied to being logged in to Steam. Generally speaking, you can only use your Steam account--and thus, the games that are associated with it--on one machine at a time. Games are usually downloaded over the Internet when they are installed, rather than installing from local media, and sometimes downloads are slow.\n\nSteam ran on Windows first. Windows software can be packaged into discrete units (.msi files). There is a utility that performs installation (Windows Installer), information about what software is installed is stored in a local database (the registry), and there is a Control Panel applet providing a central place to browse installed software and uninstall whatever is unneeded (Add/Remove Programs).\nThat is to say that Windows has a package manager. It is not as sophisticated at managing dependencies as dpkg, but it is otherwise comparable.\nWhat Windows did not have (and still does not have) is a package manager that automatically retrieves software from the Internet, installs it, retrieves and installs whatever other programs or libraries your software needs to run, and keeps your software up to date automatically. That's always been the main benefit of Steam to users. It is a highly functional, third-party package manager for Windows.\nGNU/Linux operating systems, though (and our BSD cousins) have had advanced package managers built into the OS for decades! In Ubuntu this functionality is currently provided mainly by APT, the Software Updater, and the Software Center. Ubuntu has always had this functionality. And we've had it for every part of the system, and many thousands of additional programs.\nIn Steam, games are installed for users, not (just) computers.\nThe Debian package management infrastructure has already been extended in Ubuntu to support installation and license management for proprietary payware applications. The Software Center adds this functionality, and is thus somewhat comparable to Steam. For example, users can purchase a number of for-pay games in the Software Center, such as Amnesia: The Dark Descent (which can also be purchased through Steam and in other ways).\nWhen you install software in the Ubuntu Software Center, you must authenticate with your password. The software is installed systemwide. If you've purchased software, you can install it on other machines too. (Though you should consult the relevant license agreements, applicable law, and I am not a laywer and this is not legal advice.) However, often license agreements will prohibit you from using one license in two places at once.\nWith Steam, you log in to the Steam service to install and play games, and this is entirely separate from your Ubuntu user account. Multiple Steam users can be and often are set up on the same machine. A game two users have purchased is not (generally) stored twice on the hard drive, but it is accessible just while logged in to Steam as a user who has purchased it.\nIn some ways, this is inconvenient--if I purchased two unrelated games, why can't my friend play one of them on one of my computers while I play another one on my computer? On the other hand, this is also convenient--I needn't worry about what computers are available; I can log in to my Steam account anywhere and install the games (and they won't affect anybody else's Steam account, even on the same machine).\nAfter all, games are played by people, not computers.\n\nA: Steam is a major online store for purchasing and downloading PC games.\nThe availability of Steam on Linux is not just important because it's a games store, but because it signifies that a major commercial player in the PC games space now cares about Linux.\nWith PC games we're largely at the mercy of whichever platforms the producers choose.\nBringing PC gaming to Linux attempts to address, for many Linux users who are also keen PC gamers, the one thing they still dual-boot with Windows for.\nGaming has been one area where Linux has struggled to hold its own against Windows, especially enthusiast/hardcore gaming.  These games by their nature are proprietary; they require significant investment in artwork and design to produce which does not lend the resulting product very well to open source equivalents of the same standard being made (unlike other software like office suites, video players or 3d graphics editors).  Thus these games tend to remain proprietary, which means that users are at the mercy of whichever hardware platform and OS the game producers wish to target.  Steam on Linux gives such game producers a little more reason to target Linux as well as Windows.\nFor PC gaming to grow on Linux, somebody had to make the first move.\nIt's not just the lack of quality games, it's also the historically poor quality support from hardware vendors, particularly graphics card vendors, that has held back PC gaming on Linux.  It's a chicken and egg scenario, and someone had to go first.  The fact that Steam is going first means other players, once they see value in PC gaming on Linux, potentially have some reason to follow.\nOnly a small selection of games are available via Steam on Linux.\nEach game would need to be individually ported to Linux in order to be available via Steam - it's not enough just that the store itself now supports Linux.  Thankfully, a number of titles are already available for Linux and the number is expected to grow at a slow pace.\n\nA: Steam is a  multi-player platform developed by Valve Corporation. It is used to distribute games and related media online.Steam provides the user with installation and automatic management of software across multiple computers, community features such as friends lists and groups and in-game voice and chat functionality. Steam was initially developed for Microsoft Windows, they have now expanded to include a Mac OS X version and Linux, and  limited functionality on the PlayStation 3 and for both iOS and Android mobile devices. In addition to being a central hub for gaming software,they have created a version of Steam with altered functionality to be used in schools for educational software. There are many single player games also available in the Steam store. For more check this out.\n", "Q: Desktop environment agnostic method for prompting the user for a password? In Gnome, there is gksudo.\nIn KDE, there is kdesudo.\nIs there a command that can be run on any desktop environment that will prompt the user for the root password and then run a command?\n\nA: The manpage for the zenity command  contains the following description:\n\nzenity  is a program that will display GTK+ dialogs, and return (either in the return code, or on standard output) the users input.\n\nAs far as I can tell (and my testing backs this up), this will work in both the Gnome and KDE desktop environments. For example:\nzenity --password | sudo -S nautilus\n\n...will prompt you for your root password and then launch Nautilus.\n", "Q: What's the function of wget's -O -? I see some linux page says how to install the key:\n  wget http://packages.ros.org/ros.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -\n\nWhat is \"-O -\" in wget?\nIt seems related with \"add -\".\nHow these works?\nThank you~\n\nA: I used ** to indicate it is important.\nfrom man wget\n-O file\n   --output-document=file\n       The documents will not be written to the appropriate files, but all\n       will be concatenated together and written to file.  ** If - is used as\n       file, documents will be printed to standard output, disabling link\n       conversion.  (Use ./- to print to a file literally named -.) **\n\n       Use of -O is not intended to mean simply \"use the name file instead\n       of the one in the URL;\" rather, it is analogous to shell\n       redirection: wget -O file http://foo is intended to work like wget\n       -O - http://foo > file; file will be truncated immediately, and all\n       downloaded content will be written there.\n\nand from man apt-key\nadd filename\n       Add a new key to the list of trusted keys. The key is read from\n       filename, or ** standard input if filename is -.**\n\nthis explains your command.\n\nA: The option -O - prints the downloaded file to standard output (instead of a ordinary file) and the - option in apt-key reads from standard input. The command is equivalent to the two commands:\nwget http://packages.ros.org/ros.key\nsudo apt-key add ros.key\n\nWhen you chain both commands you don't have to bother with saving a file and usually the command is shorter.\n", "Q: Enable passwordless sudo as a specific user I have two users on my system: itsadok, my main user, and elasticsearch, a user with a different ulimit for running ElasticSearch.\nI would like to be able to run stuff as the secondary user without being prompted for password every time. \nI added the following line to /etc/sudoers:\nitsadok ALL=(elasticsearch:elasticsearch) NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nThe way I understand it, this should allow the user itsadok, on any host, to run any command as (user or group) elasticsearch without a password.

If not, you should check your network. Maybe some device interrupts TLS packets.\n", "Q: Why does my shell open many instances of itself? I've been messing with the chsh command so that I could change the name displayed in my shell before each command is issued, for example picard@ubuntu:$. My problem arose when I gave the command chsh -s /bin/ksh picard, not fully knowing what the results would be. Among this command, I also used grep ksh /etc/shells/. Now, any time I try to open a terminal, be it bash, dash, sh or urxvt, it either just doesn't open or starts spawning instances of urxvt until it has so many open, the computer hangs and then the instances are all closed.\nWhat exactly did I screw up? I really would prefer not having to reinstall, but I can't use Linux without a command line, which I'm sure you guys can sympathize with.\n\nA: The command chsh has nothing to do with changing your prompt. As the manpage of chsh(1) writes, it's purpose is to change your login shell. So at the moment ksh is your login shell. If you want to change that, simply enter\nchsh -s /bin/bash picard\n\nThis makes bash your login shell. Usually this is the default at Ubuntu.\nYou can also open a terminal with the command urxvt -e /bin/bash or just urxvt -e bash. When you open a terminal without using the -e option, your system will start ksh. By default ksh only uses $ as prompt. So thatswhy you see no fancy user@system prompt.\nHowever another way to change back your login shell is to edit /etc/passwd. Open the file with your favorite editor like:\nsudo vim /etc/passwd #or\nsudo nano /etc/passwd #or\ngksudo gedit /etc/passwd\n\nand move to the line with your user name. At the end of the line you'll find /bin/ksh. Change it to /bin/bash, save the file and log in again. Now you should have your usual shell back.\nIf you want to change your prompt, enter echo $PS1 to see actual settings. The bash manpage tells you what to change to have a nice prompt.\n", "Q: Nvidia 7800 gtx (drivers not working for 12.04) I bought a used nvidia 7800 gtx card and plugged it in to the motherboard and then plugged the monitor into the the vga portion of a dvi to vga converter located in the back of the card. I booted up and got a 640x480 resolution. I then attempted to install the nvidia 304.37 driver. I now know that this driver has been updated to 304.64. Anyway, I installed the 304.37 driver, restarted the computer, the screen went white and black then dropped me to a command prompt. \nI have since uninstalled that driver, reinstalled 304.60, 304.64, and attempted a couple of others -- all of which were unsuccessful. The furthest I have been able to get thus far is the 'ubuntu' picture showing when the operating system is loading. \nI have googled this for a while now and some other things I've tried are sudo apt-get install nvidia-current nvidia-settings, sudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates, sudo apt-get install nvidia-experimental-304, searching the kernel log file for hints (I read it could be an issue with nouveau but found nothing in the log files about noveau).

Still fails. Succeeds directly on command line.\n\n*There is no /var/log/cron file on my machine. Subsidiary question: How can I get it?\n\n\nUpdates END\nI have a Google Doc that I need to update at regular intervals multiple times a day. The content that would form a particular update cannot be predicted or determined programatically. So, the best solution I have is to have the particular Google Doc page open up automatically at fixed intervals and then I manually add the data to it.\nNow, the problem is that what works directly on the command line does not work when used in crontab. Below is what I have tried (using 2mins interval just for testing) - \n*/2 * * * * date >> /tmp/crontest\n*/2 * * * * /opt/google/chrome/chrome PARTICULAR_GOOGLE_DOC_URL &\n\n\n\n*\n\n*If I cat /tmp/crontest , I see timestamps added there for every 2nd minute\n\n*If I just try /opt/google/chrome/chrome PARTICULAR_GOOGLE_DOC_URL on the shell, it works as expected\n\n*But PARTICULAR_GOOGLE_DOC_URL does not get opened in my chrome every 2nd min as it should.

It may also be unhappy without other variables (eg, DBUS related ones). Run env in a terminal to see your current environment.\n\nA: The enviroment that you get for a cronjob is very limited. For example you dont get the DISPLAY varible wich is required to open chrome.\nWrap your command in a script\n#!/bin/sh\nexport DISPLAY=:0\n/opt/google/chrome/chrome PARTICULAR_GOOGLE_DOC_URL\n\nNot realy sure if you need more variables to get it to work.

I have created a persistent live usb of Lubuntu 12.10 on a 16 GB flash pendrive with a 4GB space for persistency. \nIt basically works like an installation, as new programs can be installed and new settings and customizations added and remembered. Except that the username in terminal is lubuntu and at boot/startup am not asked for a password and the system starts without passing through the logging stage.\nBut there is a problem if one (e.g. in order to initiate certains settings) is logging out  instead of restarting/rebooting: the logging screen appears and contains initially no name and no space for password, and there's no login button: but if i click or press enter the name of user is \"Other\" and space for pass and login button appear. The name of the user cannot be changed (i guess there's no real user registered) and login doesn't work without password entered. Also, the passwords \"ubuntu\" or \"lubuntu\" are reported as incorrect.\nIs there a way of using logout-and-in or should this be avoided? \n\nA: In 14.04 the username is ubuntu and the password is blank. \n\nA: Yeah there is a way to have a consistent user:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot up the live USB again and create a new user account. You want it to be an administrator. Set the password, name, etcetera.\n\n*Log out\n\n*Log in to the account you just created\n\n\nTo create new user you need gnome-system-tools (more detail on that here).\nBut this is not a complete solution: indeed it is possible to log back in after logout, but only with the new/different user. This is useful in persistent USB in order to avoid restarting the computer after having logged out for some reason. Without a new user it was not possible to log in back at all  without restart. After creating a new user, one can log in with that new user, but not with the initial \"live\" one.\nSo, the problem is not completely solved, the initial user (here called \"lubuntu\") cannot log back in without reboot. \n\nA: go to console ctrl+alt+f1 if you're on a netbook or another funky keyboard you might have to press 'Fn' to activate the F buttons\nit is already logged in and as far as i can tell you can't log out\nrun passwd when it asks for CURRENT password press enter, that is, give it a blank password.\nthen enter a new password\nfinally use this new password to log in in x windows\n\nA: I've got it under lubuntu 14:04 beta2:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to TTY1: Ctrl+Alt+F1\n\n*Type sudo passwd lubuntu (just passwd will not work because lubuntu ask you for the old password)\n\n*Choose a new password\n\n*Go back to the X session with Alt+F7\n\n*choose lubuntu as a user and type in your new password\n\n\nWelcome back!\n\nA: \nGo to TTY1: Ctrl+Alt+F1\nType sudo passwd lubuntu (just passwd will not work because lubuntu ask you for the old password)\nChoose a new password\nGo back to the X session with Alt+F7\nchoose lubuntu as a user and type in your new password\n\n\nWorked for me as well—on a lubuntu 14.04 live usb stick. \nI'd added 'nm-applet' to the default applications in order to get the panel applet icon to appear in order to configure wi-fi and then needed to restart the session to activate it.\ntnx\n\nA: I have 14.10 ...use lubuntu for the user and enter nothing for the password(don't even click in the password field) and click login.\nHowever, if you log out your progs will be closed, instead use switch user and sign back in as the same user (lubuntu) as above.

I was installing Xubuntu onto the same hard disk that my huge installation of Windows was on and I accidentally pressed \"Okay\" after I chose to do my own partitioning. The last thing I saw before I did a hard shutdown was something about EXT4 partition tables. Is there a way to fix my (600+ GB) Windows 7 install to booting again so I don't have to redownload and reinstall all my stuff?\nI just booted the live USB I screwed my intallation with and it lists the Windows 7 partition as \"xubuntu\". \"xubuntu\" has a filesystem called \"lvm2 pv\". Am I screwed or can I change it back to whatever Windows uses without losing data?\n\nA: Unfortuantely, it would seem you are boned. From what little I understand about partitioning and the wiki article regarding ext4, the Xubuntu boot was in the process of wiping your partitions and creating its own. This does not, however, mean necessarily that the files are lost, but certainly enough information was changed or lost that the computer no longer recognizes how to boot the drive.\nYou can try removing the drive and, if you have a hard drive enclosure, a universal usb drive adaptor, or some other way of hooking up your PC's hard drive to a different and functioning computer. With any luck, your drive will appear just as any other external hard drive would and you may be able to access some if not most of your files. If it does not, or most of the files don't appear within the drive, there are various free and costly softwares available to attempt to recover the lost data.\n\n     Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_recovery_software\nThis above link offers a multitude of software. Barring any of these working your only remaining option would be an even more expensive professional recovery which carries 0 guarantee of success.\nFortunately, once you get your system up and running again, steam can re-download and reinstall all of your games.

See if everything there looks OK.\nDoes it show your current/recent print jobs in the print queue near the bottom of the page? You can post the output here if you're not sure.\nIf you have or can borrow another printer, does Firefox print to that?\nI've had printing do nothing for certain postscript files (from printing to postscript file from inside acroread).  It also happens if your printer is \"dumb\" and requires a firmware download before printing.  This is the case for HP1006C and HP1020 Laserjets, but I don't think inkjet printers have that \"feature\".\nSince it's Firefox, try entering about:config in your address bar. That will take you to the Advanced Configuration screen.\nPut \"print\" in the search bar and scroll down through the (many) entries that are still displayed.  Look for entries that contain the name of your printer.  (Once you see the actual name that is used for your printer, you can just search for that the next time you need to venture here.)\nAre there any entries for your printer at all?  If not, then that's a big problem that I don't know how to deal with, but it's a good place to start asking a more precise question.\nThere should be two types of entries. One type is about defining the printer and will start with printer_yourprintername. ...\nThe other type is about how some of the options are set right now and will start with print_tmp_printfeatures_yourprintername. (For now, ignore these.)\nIf they are there, are the entries right? This is pretty much a rhetorical question because there are a ton of them and it can be really hard to figure out what a lot of them mean at all before you even get to whether they're right or not. Look for things like whether it thinks it needs to download firmware, whether it has a definition for the size of paper you use, and whether it says anything about using a paper source (tray) that you don't have.\nThe whole about:config screen is not selectable or printable :( , so if anything looks funny or you just can't figure it out at all (It took me several years of flailing to understand what just a few of the settings do), you may want to copy the whole thing up to the web where we can see it. It should (usually) be found in $HOME/.mozilla/firefox/(some_random_string).default/prefs.js  which is a plain text file.\nFor now, don't open it with an editor.

Is this correct for my needs?\n\n\nThere can be only 4 primary partitions. That includes the extended partition sda4 which contains the logical partitions sda5 (swap) and sda6 (/home). This is as it should be. There is no way to make 5 primary partitions. \nGRUB vs Windows Bootloader\nThe WUBI install uses Windows bootloader. This is the simple one you had seen before. A full install, as you have just completed uses GRUB. There are reasons for these choices that I don't fully understand. However, I know trying to replace one with the other is a bad idea. So you may have to get used to the GRUB. Yes you can customize the GRUB menu, but that is another question.\nFile Sharing and common storage\nOut of the box, Windows does not recognize ext4 partition, but Ubuntu recognizes ntfs. So when you boot Windows you won't have access to the Ubuntu /home. \nWhen you boot Ubuntu you will have access to your Windows partition. However, Ubuntu uses a different system for storing file and folder ownership and permissions information (That's why /home cannot be in NTFS or FAT32). So when you put a file of Ubuntu origin in the NTFS partition some of the ownership and permission information may be lost. This may be fine for music, and photos at home, but is a potential problem for sensitive documents and personal configuration files.\nSearch this site for specific suggestions on how to share files between Windows and Ubuntu on the same machine. Look at Windows Ubuntu dual boot - Share files between OS for how to keep documents and files in NTFS partition and link them to folders in Ubuntu.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Will Nexus 7 with Ubuntu run Eclipse and FDT and compile out via OTG USB to another android device?

Introductory Background to the question below\n(so the question is more usable to more people)\nInside of an Ubuntu/debian-style package (*.deb file) there is a file named\n/DEBIAN/md5sums which has a content of this form:\n212ee8d0856605eb4546c3cff6aa6d35  usr/bin/file1\n4131b66dc3913fcbf795159df912809f  path/to/file2\n8c21de23b7c25c9d1a093607fc27656a  path/to/file3\nc6d010a475366e0644f3bf77d7f922fd  path/to/place/of/file4\n\nAs I assume this file will be used to check that the files which come with the package have not been corrupted somehow. Since the file is called `/DEBIAN/md5sums\" I assume the hexnumber before the path+filename is the MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm Hash of the package's files.\nNow everybody interested knows that the MD5 Hash has been broken already long time ago. Therefore it is totally possible to change the content of a file in the package (e.g maliciously) and still have the file having the same MD5-Hash (see for instance Prove of concept \"Predicting the winner....\").\nQuestion\nBearing in mind the information above I want to know the following:\nAssuming I install a package in my Ubuntu system. Is the DEBIAN/md5sums the only means to make sure the data has not been tampered with?\nAnswering the question I think it could help to figure out the following:\n\n*\n\n*Are the deb packages as a whole also hashed(Hashvalues made for) so that there is another way to make safe the files received are \"safe\"/\"untampered\"\n\n*If there are other ways then the DEBIAN/md5sums file to ensure integrity, what is the file included in the *.deb packages anyhow?\n\n*Does Ubuntu use hashes for repository/package-system that are \"less broken\" than SHA-1 and MD5?\n\nwhich unfortunately I do not know either.\nAny reponse which can shed light on the question (or even only a subquestion) is very welcome\nupdate\n(1)\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu#Authentication_Tab seems to indicate that there is (as I hoped for) some public/private gpg key going on (to keep the repos and package systems) safe from attacks. The information at the linked location is not very much though. It tells almost nothing about the security aspect of the Package-system. Anyhow I assume the link already indicates that the answer for the question will be \"NO -at least the deb packages from the repo - are also secured by .... \". Hope somebody has some insights to use for an answer here.\n(2)\nThis question seems to be also about the topic of \"security\" in Ubuntu package system. So I just add it here so its ad hand if somebody strives to figure the question out: Why are the proposed BADSIG (on apt-get update) fixes secure?\n\nA: I wanted this to be a comment, but I couldn't fit it in the box so I'm placing it here.\nYes, md5 has been broken cryptologically, but that doesn't mean it's a bad general purpose hashing algorithm. Modifying a file so it has the same hash is incredibly difficult, and doing so with a particular malicious change is nigh on impossible. From looking at the example you referenced, (Predicting The Winner) see this:\n\n\"The documents were first carefully prepared as valid PDF documents, with a hidden image object incorporated, containing a sufficient amount of random bits. Then, according to the diamond structure shown above, eleven chosen-prefix collisions were computed, and placed inside the hidden image objects at precisely the proper spots. In this way the twelve documents were turned into an MD5 multi-collision.\"\n\nWhat was done was filling the files with random data to make the hashes match. The technology isn't anywhere near capable of adding particular malicious code to a file and having the hashes line up without breaking it or making it obvious that the file has been changed (I don't know if apt does, but many file hashes are accompanied by their file sizes to increase the difficulty of an undetectable hash collision).\n\nA: Ubuntu publishes a manifest that is signed with an RSA key. The manifest lists individual Packages index files, each with MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256 hashes. Each Packages file lists individual .deb files with MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256 hashes.\nFor verification, apt uses the best hash that it supports and is published by the archive it is downloading from. In the case of the Ubuntu archive, this is SHA-256.\nSo the entire chain of installing packages on your Ubuntu system is protected by RSA and SHA-256.\nThe MD5 protection that exists in dpkg is really only useful for accidental corruption, and not necessary to protect the installation path.\nYou might be interested in the debsums package, but since it uses MD5s, it also is only useful for checking for accidental corruption.\nIf you want to check for malicious system modification, then these are not the appropriate tools for you. You will need to take the system offline and check against either a previous record, the original package files, or secure hashes generated from these.\nNote that since a successful malicious modification might be to simply downgrade a package to the one prior to a security update, checking that all installed package files match against their originals may not be sufficient either.\n\nA: md5 was not \"broken\".  What they found was a way to carefully craft an original message, and a modified message that had the same hash.  It is not possible to take an original message not specially crafted for the purpose of tampering with ( the correct file ), and modify it in such a way as to preserve its md5sum.\n", "Q: Installing swagger-ui I'd like to use Swagger, the api-documentation tool on my Ubuntu 12.04 system.

I am assuming s/he will not be able to extract anything from the main partition without doing some form of bruteforce code breaking attach?\n\nA: \nfull disk encrypted my laptop [...] swap partition [...]\n\nIt's totally up to you where you put swap partitions. Some typical set ups:\n\n\n*\n\n*dm-crypt on raw partition and /boot as small plain parition, then on top of the large crypto 'device' as LVM Physical Volume:\n-> LVM Volume Group (one PV as member) crypto -> LVM Logical Volumes:\n\n\n*\n\n*crypto-rootfs as /\n\n*crypto-homes as /home (optional)\n\n*crypto-swap as swap (optional)\n\n*leave some room in the volume group to be able to use LVM's features\n\n\nDon't try to set it up the other way around - crypto on top of individual LVs is not going to be of any advantage, but only giving you headaches.\n\n*dm-crypt on raw partition as / with separate /boot and separate non-encrypted swap.\n\n\n*\n\n*less flexible, yet more portable without LVM (e.g. FreeOTFE)\n\n*if more crypto partitions are needed this means multiple times unlocking at boot using passphrases\n\n*swap could be set up to use a random key crypto on every boot - disables hibernation\n\n\n*The above without any swap. Might be a good idea if you have plenty of RAM anyway.\nThe 'alternate' installer for 12.04 will allow you to do this in a semi-GUI way. See for example: \"How to install Ubuntu 11.04 on an encrypted LVM file system\" (while a bit old, still relevant for 12.04).\n\n\nwill the thief be able to extract my files from the swap partition?\n\nNot directly. Swap contains bare memory pages. It would be a hell of puzzle to reassemble this, but even single memory pages might contain too much secret data already. It is considered unsafe to have swap unencrypted. As long as you put your swap op top of a crypto device (no matter using LVM, RAID, or whatever), you're fine.\n\n\nI am assuming s/he will not be able to extract anything from the main partition without doing some form of bruteforce code breaking attack?\n\nNo, it's fairly safe, as that's the whole point of good encryption! To see more about the technical details like the cryptography used, please refer to What is used in the 12.10 full disk encryption? (which also covers 12.04 in my answer).\nSecurity concerns are elsewhere. You'll need a separate unencrypted /boot, no matter how you set it up. It contains kernel and initramfs. If someone can fiddle with the unlocking scripts or even put a backdoor in the kernel, they can steal your secret data. Practical advice: never leave your laptop unattended.\nWorkarounds for this (advanced set up!):\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a smartcard+reader rather than a password and carry it on your body if your laptop is not in use.\n\n*Put the dm-crypt encrypted key on a separate flash drive, rather than on the disk itself. Make copies of this encrypted key in case your flash drive dies and put them in a safe where nobody can reach it.\n\n*Always use a trusted set of kernel and initramfs, for example by using the same USB flash drive as /boot - and always carry this with you.\n\n", "Q: Issue with installing with wubi I have installed Ubuntu with wubi, dual booting with Windows XP.

This behaviour does not occur with Windows 7 (I am dual booting). \nI am thinking of installing a newer version of the Synaptics touchpad driver for Ubuntu. Anyone know how this can be done?\nSecond, any other approaches I should consider?\n\nA: I noticed this question is posted frequently without solutions being given. The problem makes the touchpad difficult to use, it is a serious problem.\nIn the end I found a solution (for a Dell XPS 15). It is all about the setting for FingerPress. When not set explicitly, the value is 256, which is way too high (value can be checked by typing \"synclient -l\". You can set it to a more reasonable value manually by doing \"synclient FingerPress=100\". I found it also better to increase the values for FingerLow and FingerHigh a bit.\nOf course you will want to make the setting permanent, so that it will survive a reboot. In that case you need to put the setting in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf (see e.g. How to configure the touchpad middle click? how to do that).\nI hope Ubuntu can improve auto configuring of different type of synaptics touchpads to a next level, for most users it is hard to solve.\n", "Q: External Mount.... is it possible \nPossible Duplicate:\nInstalling Ubuntu on external hard disk \n\nHow can I mount ubuntu to my external hdd.

I have the following rc.local script:\n#!/bin/sh -e\n#\n# rc.local\n#\n# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.\n# Make sure that the script will \"exit 0\" on success or any other\n# value on error.\n#\n# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution\n# bits.\n#\n# By default this script does nothing.\n\nsh /home/incero/startup_script.sh\n/bin/chmod +x /script.sh\nsh /script.sh\n\nexit 0\n\nThe first line, startup_script.sh actually downloads the script.sh file to /script.sh referred to in the third line.\nUnfortunately, it appears that it is not making the script executeable or running the script. Running the rc.local file manually after having started works perfectly. Can chmod not be run at startup or something?\n\nA: You can skip all the way down to A Quick Fix but that's not necessarily the best option. So I recommend reading all this first.\nrc.local doesn't tolerate errors.\nrc.local doesn't provide a way to intelligently recover from errors. If any command fails, it stops running. The first line, #!/bin/sh -e, causes it to be executed in a shell invoked with the -e flag. The -e flag is what makes a script (in this case, rc.local) stop running the first time a command fails within it.\nYou want rc.local to behave like this. If a command fails, you do not want it to continue on with whatever other startup commands might be relying on it having succeeded.\nSo if any command fails, the subsequent commands will not run. The problem here is that /script.sh did not run (not that it failed, see below), so most likely some command before it failed. But which one?\nWas it /bin/chmod +x /script.sh?\nNo.\nchmod runs fine at any time. Provided the filesystem that contains /bin was mounted, you can run /bin/chmod. And /bin is mounted before rc.local runs.\nWhen run as root, /bin/chmod rarely fails. It will fail if the file it operates on is read-only, and might fail if the filesystem it's on doesn't supported permissions. Neither is likely here.\nBy the way, sh -e is the only reason it would actually be a problem if chmod failed. When you run a script file by explicitly invoking its interpreter, it doesn't matter if the file is marked executable. Only if it said /script.sh would the file's executable bit matter. Since it says sh /script.sh, it doesn't (unless of course /script.sh calls itself while it runs, which could fail from it not being executable, but it's unlikely it calls itself).\nSo what failed?\nsh /home/incero/startup_script.sh failed. Almost certainly.\nWe know it ran, because it downloaded /script.sh.\n(Otherwise, it would be important to make sure it did run, in case somehow /bin was not in PATH--rc.local doesn't necessarily have the same PATH as you have when you're logged in. If /bin weren't in rc.local's path, this would require sh to be run as /bin/sh. Since it did run, /bin is in PATH, which means you can run other commands that are located in /bin, without fully qualifying their names. For example, you can run just chmod rather than /bin/chmod. However, in keeping with your style in rc.local, I've used fully qualified names for all commands except sh, whenever I am suggesting you run them.)\nWe can be pretty sure /bin/chmod +x /script.sh never ran (or you would see that /script.sh was executed). And we know sh /script.sh wasn't run either.\nBut it downloaded /script.sh. It succeeded! How could it fail?\nTwo Meanings of Success\nThere are two different things a person might mean when s/he says a command succeeded:\n\n*\n\n*It did what you wanted it to do.\n\n*It reported that it succeeded.\n\nAnd so it is for failure. When a person says a command failed, it could mean:\n\n*\n\n*It did not do what you wanted it to do.\n\n*It reported that it failed.\n\nA script run with sh -e, like rc.local, will stop running the first time a command reports that it failed. It doesn't make a difference what the command actually did.\nUnless you intend for startup_script.sh to report failure when it does what you want, this is a bug in startup_script.sh.\n\n*\n\n*Some bugs prevent a script from doing what you want it to do. They affect what programmers call its side effects.\n\n*And some bugs prevent a script from reporting correctly whether or not it succeeded. They affect what programmers call its return value (which in this case is an exit status).\n\nIt's most likely that startup_script.sh did everything it should, except reported that it failed.\nHow Success Or Failure Is Reported\nA script is a list of zero or more commands. Each command has an exit status. Assuming there are no failures in actually running the script (for example, if the interpreter couldn't read the next line of the script while running it), the exit status of a script is:\n\n*\n\n*0 (success) if the script was blank (i.e., had no commands).\n\n*N, if the script ended as a result of the command exit N, where N is some exit code.\n\n*The exit code of the last command that ran in the script, otherwise.\n\nWhen an executable runs, it reports its own exit code--they're not just for scripts. (And technically, exit codes from scripts are the exit codes returned by the shells that run them.)\nFor example, if a C program ends with exit(0);, or return 0; in its main() function, the code 0 is given to the operating system, which provides it to calling process (which may, for example, be the shell from which the program was run).\n0 means the program succeeded. Every other number means it failed. (This way, different numbers can sometimes refer to different reasons the program failed.)\nCommands Meant to Fail\nSometimes, you run a program with the intention that it will fail. In these situations, you might think of its failure as success, even though it is not a bug that the program reports failure. For example, you might use rm on a file you suspect already does not exist, just to make sure it's deleted.\nSomething like this is probably happening in startup_script.sh, just before it stops running. The last command to run in the script is probably reporting failure (even though its \"failure\" might be totally fine or even necessary), which makes the script report failure.\nTests Meant to Fail\nOne special kind of command is a test, by which I mean a command run for its return value rather than its side effects. That is, a test is a command that is run so that its exit status can be examined (and acted upon).\nFor example, suppose I forget if 4 is equal to 5. Fortunately, I know shell scripting:\nif [ 4 -eq 5 ]; then\n    echo \"Yeah, they're totally the same.\"\nfi\n\nHere, the test [ -eq 5 ] fails because it turns out 4 ≠ 5 after all. That doesn't mean the test didn't perform correctly; it did. It's job was to check if 4 = 5, then report success if so, and failure if not.\nYou see, in shell scripting, success can also mean true, and failure can also mean false.\nEven though the echo statement never runs, the if block as a whole does return success.\nHowever, supposed I'd written it shorter:\n[ 4 -eq 5 ] && echo \"Yeah, they're totally the same.\"\n\nThis is common shorthand. && is a boolean and operator. A && expression, which consists of && with statements on either side, returns false (failure) unless both sides return true (success). Just like a normal and.\nIf someone asks you, \"did Derek go to the mall and think about a butterfly?\" and you know Derek didn't go to the mall, you don't have to bother figuring out if he thought of a butterfly.\nSimilarly, if the command to the left of && fails (false), the whole && expression immediately fails (false). The statement on the right side of && is never run.\nHere, [ 4 -eq 5 ] runs. It \"fails\" (returning false). So the whole && expression fails. echo \"Yeah, they're totally the same.\" never runs. Everything behaved as it should be, but this command reports failure (even though the otherwise equivalent if conditional above reports success).\nIf that were the last statement in a script (and the script got to it, rather than terminating at some point before it), the whole script would report failure.\nThere's lots of tests besides this. For example, there are tests with || (\"or\"). However, the above example should be sufficient to explain what tests are, and make it possible for you to effectively use documentation to determine if a particular statement/command is a test.\nsh vs. sh -e, Revisited\nSince the #! line (see also this question) at the top of /etc/rc.local has sh -e, the operating system runs the script as though it were invoked with the command:\nsh -e /etc/rc.local\n\nIn contrast, your other scripts, such as startup_script.sh, run without the -e flag:\nsh /home/incero/startup_script.sh\n\nConsequently they keep running even when a command in them reports failure.\nThis is normal and good. rc.local should be invoked with sh -e and most other scripts--including most scripts run by rc.local--should not.\nJust make sure to remember the difference:\n\n*\n\n*Scripts run with sh -e exit reporting failure the first time a command they contain exits reporting failure.\nIt's as though the script were a single long command consisting of all the commands in the script joined with && operators.\n\n\n*Scripts run with sh (without -e) continue running until they get to a command that terminates (exits out of) them, or to the very end of the script. The success or failure of every command is essentially irrelevant (unless the next command checks it). The script exits with the exit status of the last command run.\nHelping Your Script Understand It's Not Such a Failure After All\nHow can you keep your script from thinking it failed when it didn't?\nYou look at what happens just before it's done running.\n\n*\n\n*If a command failed when it ought to have succeeded, figure out why, and fix the problem.\n\n\n*If a command failed, and that was the right thing to happen, then prevent that failure status from propagating.\n\n*\n\n*One way to keep a failure status from propagating is to run another command that succeeds. /bin/true has no side effects and reports success (just as /bin/false does nothing and also fails).\n\n\n*Another is to make sure the script is terminated by exit 0.\nThat's not necessarily the same thing as exit 0 being at the end of the script. For example, there might be an if-block where the script exits inside.\nIt's best to know what causes your script to report failure, before making it report success. If it really is failing in some way (in the sense of not doing what you want it to do), you don't really want it to report success.\nA Quick Fix\nIf you can't make startup_script.sh exit reporting success, you can change the command in rc.local that runs it, so that command reports success even though startup_script.sh did not.\nCurrently you have:\nsh /home/incero/startup_script.sh\n\nThis command has the same side effects (i.e., the side effect of running startup_script.sh), but always reports success:\nsh /home/incero/startup_script.sh || /bin/true\n\nRemember, it's better to know why startup_script.sh reports failure, and fix it.\nHow the Quick Fix Works\nThis is actually an example of a || test, an or test.\nSuppose you ask if I took out the trash or brushed the owl. If I took out the trash, I can truthfully say \"yes,\" even if I don't remember whether or not I brushed the owl.\nThe command to the left of || runs. If it succeeds (true), then the right-hand side doesn't have to run. So if startup_script.sh reports success, the true command never runs.\nHowever, if startup_script.sh reports failure [I didn't take out the trash], then the result of /bin/true [if I brushed the owl] matters.\n/bin/true always returns success (or true, as we sometimes call it). Consequently, the whole command succeeds, and the next command in rc.local can run.\nAn additional note on success/failure, true/false, zero/nonzero.\nFeel free to ignore this. You might want to read this if you program in more than one language, though (i.e., not just shell scripting).\nIt is a point of great confusion for shell scripters taking up programming languages like C, and for C programmers taking up shell scripting, to discover:\n\n*\n\n*In shell scripting:\n\n*\n\n*A return value of 0 means success and/or true.\n\n*A return value of something other than 0 means failure and/or false.\n\n\n\n*In C programming:\n\n*\n\n*A return value of 0 means false..\n\n*A return value of something other than 0 means true.\n\n*There is no simple rule for what means success and what means failure. Sometimes 0 means success, other times it means failure, other times it means that the sum of the two numbers you just added is zero. Return values in general programming are used to signal a wide variety of different sorts of information.\n\n*A program's numeric exit status should indicate success or failure in accordance with the rules for shell scripting. That is, even though 0 means false in your C program, you still make your program return 0 as its exit code if you want it to report it succeeded (which the shell then interprets as true).\n\n\n\n\nA: You can (in Unix variants I use) override the default behavior by changing:\n#!/bin/sh -e\n\nTo:\n#!/bin/sh\n\nAt the start of the script.  The \"-e\" flag instructs sh to exit on the first error.  The long name of that flag is \"errexit\", so the original line is equivalent to:\n#!/bin/sh --errexit\n\n\nA: @Bryce 's answer is perfectly fine in certain situations--depending on what you are using rc.local for.  If it's absolutely critical that nothing happen after the first error, of course -e is exactly what you want.

If it is on a different network, check both the gateway firewall and the host firewall (iptables) and make sure that port 22 is allowed.\nTo do this, follow these instructions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Login as the root user.\n\n*Open /etc/sysconfig/iptables file, enter:\n# vi /etc/sysconfig/iptables\n\n\n*Find line that read as follows:\nCOMMIT\n\n\n*To open port 22 (ssh), enter (before COMMIT line):\n-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT\n\n\n*Save and close the file. Restart the firewall:\n# /etc/init.d/iptables restart\n\n\n*Next check to make sure the service is listening.\n\n*Try issuing the command:\nnetstat -vatn | grep :22 and see if port 22 is listening.  \nYou could also try:\nnetstat -vatn | grep ssh\n\nThis will take care of the host-based firewall, but if there is a network-based firewall between you and the machine you are trying to remote into then you will have to consult that specific device's instructions for allowing connections to port 22 into the network.\n", "Q: Youtube web app not working in Ubuntu 12.10 I just installed Youtube web app in Ubuntu using this command,\nsudo apt-get install unity-webapps-youtube\n\nbut I cannot make it working or I do not find any Youtube icon on the dash.\n\nA: Have you installed the webapps feature and added it'd PPA before that?\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webapps/preview\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unity-webapps-preview\nTry that and then logout and back in to see if it works!\n", "Q: How do I install signal so I can install Octave? anyone can help me with this error?\noctave:4> pkg install signal-1.2.0.tar.gz\nerror: the following dependencies where unsatisfied:\n   signal needs optim >= 1.0.0\n signal needs specfun >= 0.0.0\n signal needs control >= 2.2.3\n signal needs general >= 1.3.2\noctave:4> pkg install optim-1.2.2.tar.gz\nerror: the following dependencies where unsatisfied:\n   optim needs miscellaneous >= 1.0.10\n optim needs struct >= 1.0.10\noctave:4> pkg install struct-1.0.10.tar.gz\nmake: /usr/bin/mkoctfile: Command not found\nmake: *** [fields2cell.oct] Error 127\n'make' returned the following error: make: Entering directory `/tmp/oct-fDBs5k/struct-1.0.10/src'\n/usr/bin/mkoctfile -s fields2cell.cc\nmake: Leaving directory `/tmp/oct-fDBs5k/struct-1.0.10/src'\nerror: called from `pkg>configure_make' in file /usr/share/octave/3.6.2/m/pkg/pkg.m near line 1391, column 9\nerror: called from:\nerror:   /usr/share/octave/3.6.2/m/pkg/pkg.m at line 834, column 5\nerror:   /usr/share/octave/3.6.2/m/pkg/pkg.m at line 383, column 9\n\nI need to install signal package, but I have to download other to work from I have noticed but it gets stuck when installing struct package.\n@edit\nThe same error when trying to install misc~ package.\noctave:5> pkg install miscellaneous-1.2.0.tar.gz\nerror: the following dependencies where unsatisfied:\n   miscellaneous needs general >= 1.3.1\noctave:5> pkg install general-1.3.2.tar.gz\nmake: /usr/bin/mkoctfile: Command not found\nmake: *** [__exit__.oct] Error 127\n'make' returned the following error: make: Entering directory `/tmp/oct-CA6o4U/general/src'\n/usr/bin/mkoctfile __exit__.cc\nmake: Leaving directory `/tmp/oct-CA6o4U/general/src'\nerror: called from `pkg>configure_make' in file /usr/share/octave/3.6.2/m/pkg/pkg.m near line 1391, column 9\nerror: called from:\nerror:   /usr/share/octave/3.6.2/m/pkg/pkg.m at line 834, column 5\nerror:   /usr/share/octave/3.6.2/m/pkg/pkg.m at line 383, column 9\n\n@edit\nadditional info:\noctave:6> which mkoctfile\n`mkoctfile' is a function from the file /usr/share/octave/3.6.2/m/miscellaneous/mkoctfile.m\n\nI have no idea what to do..\n\nA: You can install signal by entering the following command in the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install octave-signal\n\nThis will install signal-1.1.3, at least in Ubuntu Quantal.

I am hosting quite a lot of virtual hosts using Apache in a basic LAMP set up with the help of Webmin/Virtualmin. I am looking for a top-like tool in which I can monitor current connections. The virtual hosting part seems to be giving me trouble here. Here's what I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*netstat - I can see the connections, but they show me as if they're all using my primary domain, e.g. mydomain.com:www.\n\n*iftop -  I like it a lot, but similar downside as netstat: does not show the virtual host.\n\n*apachetop - seems to be showing not information for all my virtual hosts. I'm logging to separate custom log files, which I'm suspecting is the cause for why it doesn't work.\n\n*ntop, darkstat, MRTG, bwm-ng, IPTraf - not working either.\n\n\nSo, basically, I'm looking for something similar to the current output of netstat, but to include the virtual host the request is for, e.g.: avirtualsite.com:www.\n\nA: You can check this with:\nnetstat -na | grep 'ESTA'\n\n\nA: Andrea Corbellini's answer explains you why it won't work with the tools you're using and how Virtual Hosting works. Here's the most simple way I can think of to get it done in Apache...\nmod_status will help you out.\nDisclaimer: I can't tell how this is done in Webmin - I use bare configuration files to set up servers. Here's just a basic overview of the steps.\nIt's a top-like tool, but represented as a web page. It lists the current state directly queried from Apache, so it's not depending on parsing log files like apachetop does.\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable mod_status:\nsudo a2enmod status\n\n\n*Grant yourself access.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/status.conf and edit:\n\n*Set ExtendedStatus to On (optional, but more awesomeness and a little slower)\n\n*Within the <Location /server-status>, append your IP address to the line with the Allow directive. Example:\nAllow from 127.0.0.1 ::1 66.77.88.99\n\n\n\n*Restart Apache:\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\n\n*Enjoy the tool in your browser, for example: http://1.2.3.4/server-status\nIt will look like this example screenshot.\n\n*Keep pressing F5 to get updates. Or get an awesome browser plugin and watch it being updated!\n\nWebmin\naddendum by the OP for future visitors\nIn Webmin, the basic steps about the Status module can be found here:\n\n\n*\n\n*Servers -> Apache Webserver -> Configure Apache Modules\n\n*Select the Status module and click click Enable Selected Modules\n\n\nA: Another way is to type \ntail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log\n\nin your terminal \n\nA: All the tools you are trying will never give you the right answer. The reason is that the information you are requesting is lost when the connection is made.\nLet's use an example: suppose your web server has one IP address (1.2.3.4) and two host names (a.mydomain.com and b.mydomain.com) that resolve to that IP address.\nWhat happens when you use your favorite web browser when you visit a.mydomain.com?\n\n\n*\n\n*The browser asks your DNS server the IP address a.mydomain.com corresponds to.\n\n*The DNS server tells the browser the address is 1.2.3.4.\n\n*The web browser connects to 1.2.3.4.\n\n\nSo netstat & co. only know that there's an incoming connection made to 1.2.3.4. The reason why you see a host name instead of an IP address is that the IP address has a rDNS record, so netstat prefers to show that instead of the IP, because it's nicer. Try netstat -n (or remove the rDNS record) and you'll see the IP address.\nBut that's not all: when I said that the information about the host name that was used to make the connection was lost, I wasn't fully right. From the point of view of the TCP/IP stack, that sentence is true. But if we see the things from the point of view of the HTTP protocol, things are different. In every HTTP request there's a Host: header that contains the host name that was used by the browser to make the request.\nSo, in short, you should look at the log files of your web server. The web server is the service that handles the HTTP requests and therefore the only service that knows about the \"original\" host name.\n\nA: You can check all ips connected on port 80 with this bash\nnetstat -tn 2>/dev/null | grep :80 | awk '{print $5}' | cut -d: -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head\n\nNote: if you want to see other port, change 80\nOUTPUT:\n 19 x.174.143.1\n 13 x.175.135.1\n  9 x.68.135.1\n  8 x.144.87.1\n  7 x.68.150.1\n  6 x.92.4.1\n  6 x.188.23.1\n  5 x.190.164.1\n  4 x.189.156.1\n\n\nA: If you want pid, user and command:\nlsof  -i  tcp:443,80 | egrep 'PID|->' | sort -k9\n\n\nA: You can also use GoAccess interactively to view your current visitors.

I've got a monitor connected using Display Port to my laptop.\nWhen I switch secondary monitor to be on left (by default it's on right) and I turn off the monitor, all apps from primary monitor disappear (they go to secondary monitor which is turned off :)).\nThe workaround is to put everything in secondary monitor and turn of the screen (using \"Displays\" app).\nIt's really annoying and maybe some of you guys know to fix that.\nIt looks for me as a bug, but maybe there is some solution..\n\nA: I can't offer a solution, but rather an explanation and some workarounds.\nExplanation\nThis problem is caused because window positions are stored as positive coordinates from the top-left display.\nThe software doesn't consider any of your monitors to be \"secondary\", but the top-left display is kind of \"primary\" because its top-left corner is used as the origin for window coordinates.\nWhen you add or remove a display (by connecting/disconnecting it or turning it on/off) above or to the left of your laptop screen you are changing the origin of the window coordinate system and this will cause all your windows to move because in Ubuntu, sadly, the windows retain their absolute top-left coordinates regardless of display changes.\nWorkarounds\n\n\n*\n\n*Rather than having to move your windows before you connect/disconnect your external display, you can find them afterwards by pressing Super+S to show your workspaces. This is slightly less annoying.\n\n*Instead of aligning your external monitor to the left (which causes the coordinate system origin to move and the windows to change screen) you could keep it physically to the left, but aligned below in the display settings. This is still \"wrong\" but I find it less mentally jarring to have the \"secondary\" screen considered \"below\" than in the opposite direction to where it physically is.\n\nHopefully in the future there will be a fix to ensure windows' positions are updated during a display change so that they remain on the same physical display afterwards.\n", "Q: Ideapad Z580 won't boot kernels above 3.2.0-32 I'm running Ubuntu 64 bit 12.04.1 LTS.

Should I choose one over a tarball? I'm about to download Dungeon Defenders from the Humble Bundle website, and I am presented with two options: a .tar.bz2 tarball and a .mojo.run MojoSetup file.\nWhich should I choose? What are the benefits of a .mojo.run file? How easy is it to uninstall a MojoSetup file? How well integrated is it with Ubuntu?\nI'm interested in hearing a general answer about .mojo.run files, the Dungeon Defenders game was just an example and not the core of my question.\n\nA: What is MojoSetup?\n\nhttps://launchpad.net/mojosetup\nA cross-platform, standalone installer.\n\nFrom Phoronix:\n\n...With the Loki graphical installer (loki_setup) being fairly old, Ryan C. Gordon \"Icculus\" recent set out to work on version 2.0 of loki_setup. However, he came to the conclusion that he wanted to rewrite loki_setup from scratch, and thus MojoSetup was born. Ryan's MojoSetup is designed specifically to solve shortcomings in loki_setup while making this the next-generation graphical installer for Linux and other *NIX platforms. MojoSetup uses the Lua scripting language instead of XML, uses plugins for the user interface, a rollback mechanism for uninstallation, and the installer can access packages via FTP and HTTP (in addition to CDs, DVDs, SMBs, USB drives, etc), and is all distributed under the zlib license. The interface is also modern and Gordon had referred to it as looking like an Apple software installer...\n\nThis is the official site.\n\n\nWhich should I choose? What are the benefits of a .mojo.run file?\n\nFrom what I see, it provides an easier way of Installing and Uninstalling software. Without going through the package manager. Because you see not very distribution has a Ubuntu Software Center, Synaptic, Gdebi or Muon Software Center for GUI.\n\nHow well integrated is it with Ubuntu?\n\nIt seems like it's a Universal solution and not geared specifically towards Ubuntu.\n\nWhat are .mojo.run files? Should I choose one over a tarball?\n\nFinally answering your question, mojo.run files are Graphical Installers. Should you choose one over the other?, do you prefer a nice graphical installer or the .sh file you'd run in the terminal?.\n", "Q: I get a black screen trying to boot Live CD on MacBook Pro I've been trying to boot into Ubuntu using both a DVD and a USB Stick. They both work on my desktop computer, but not on my MacBook Pro (8,2). I can get them to show up in the boot menu, and I get to an ASCII menu where I can try Ubuntu, go straight to installation, or check for defects (there's a 4th option I can't remember). But when I choose to try Ubuntu, it just goes to a black screen. I can hear the DVD reading for a few minutes, then it stops. If I hit enter, it starts reading from the DVD again. This makes be think it's booting, but the display drivers aren't working. What can I do?\n\nA: It's a fairly common problem with dual card gfx card Macbooks on Linux. \nIt's usually caused by the fact that the computer has a discrete and integrated gfx card. And improperly uses the card that is not currently connected to the display panel.\nThe problem and a solution is mentioned here\n", "Q: Which document scanners work with Ubuntu? I'm searching for a scanner which helps me to turn my invoces and other random papers into pdfs. I need Linux support because I do not own a Windows/Linux device and using a virtual machine is not a solution.\nA automated document feeder (ADF) is necessary. Whether the device consists only of a ADF or is a combination of a ADF with a flatbed is not that important, I would go for the second solution if I have the choice.\nI thought about the Canonc P-215, but I was not able to check its Linux support. The SANE device list does not mention this scanner.\n\nA: You can use almost any printer that has a USB interface... USB would be on the front, not the output to PC connections. Look for Scan to USB, or Scan to Thumbdrive. All versions of Ubuntu, I have used, will recognize the thumbdrive on the Networked or Installed Printer. So you would need to use the internal scan functions on the printer.  This capability is found often in Multi-Function all in one Printers. If you use grayscale, and PDF for the scan and save config, often times the ADF will run quicker then Neatdesk. The problem being that integrated ADFs tend to start scanning crooked early on, so repairs and tunes ups occur quite frequently.  \"This is from personal experience\" :D Hope you found this helpful.\n\nA: HP has excellent Linux support, see HP's site here.\n\nA: I have the Canon P-215 you mentioned. I got it in 2013 because of the high recommendation it received on theWireCuttr. Sadly, I wasn't able to get it to work on Linux.\nHowever, Canon have released Linux drivers (release date February 4th 2015) which can be found here: Linux Drivers.\nThe driver page states that the drivers have support for the following Linux Distributions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu: 12.10, 13.04, 13.10, 14.04\n\n*Debian: 6.0, 7.0\n\n*Fedora: 17, 18, 19, 20\n\n*OpenSUSE: 12.2, 12.3, 13.1\n\n", "Q: What package should I install for driver of the Atheros AR8161 Ethernet Controller without net?

I was unable to login to the Ubuntu installation, it did not show a proper login screen and was unresponsive. So then using UBCD4Windows i deleted the main big Ubuntu partition.

Is there anyway to make this installation persistent? Or is there another way that I can install ubuntu live usb for mac without refit (I want to be able to use it on numerous computers) that can make it persistent?\nThanks!\n\nA: This is probably bug #1159016.  In short the persistence is created only on the syslinux boot, not on the grub boot, so you have to edit /boot/grub/grub.cfg and add the word \"persistent\" onto the linux boot line yourself.\n", "Q: When I try to install Ubuntu on my mac, the option to install alongside mac osx does not appear I've been trying for days now to install Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS on my mac but it does not give me the option to install it alongside my mac osx. The only options available are to replace mac osx or partition manually, which I have tried and tried to do but I have no clue what I am doing, and there is no easy to follow guide on how to do it. I have at least 20G on my HD that I reserved for Ubuntu, and I don't understand why the option doesn't appear. Help!\n\nA: To install manually alongside mac OS, first reduce the size of your hard disk partition in mac OS. Then start the installation, choose install manually and create two partitions. One big one type ext4, mount point / and a swap partition the size of your RAM or a bit more (4Gb?).\nThat should do the trick. The / partition is called the root partition and should contain all your Ubuntu system and your home folder as well.\nSince this is your first such operation it is strongly recommended to do a backup of your important data on the drive just in case you mess things up.\n", "Q: Lubuntu Taskbar Problem with X2go I have a box with Ubuntu 12.04 installed and then the lxde and lubuntu-desktop packages were installed.\nWhen accessing the box with X2go, suspending the session and returning, the taskbar is mostly blank.

How do I find out if a particular program in the \"Software Center\" is still being maintained?\n\nA: Open the USC \nFind the app in question:\nExample Gparted \nyou can see the installed date. If I were to scrolldown I can now see the add-ons the version and the updates from the source as well as reviews.\nIf you click on history, you now can view the installation dates as well as any updates\n\nA: \"Maintained\" means different things for different projects, but in general if something is available in the Software Center, then it was maintained on some level, at the time of the Ubuntu release you're running on.\nMany of the applications and libraries will never see updates throughout the life cycle of an Ubuntu release, simply because they are not necessarily maintained by specific people in Ubuntu, and do not get much attention. These tend to be in the universe archive, which you can disable (or enable) in the Software Sources properties from within Software Center. Some of them may get bug fixes, but don't expect much.\nOnly apps which are \"supported\" are definite candidates for fixes. This is mostly the \"main\" archive of the Ubuntu repository, and there are some things in universe as well.\n\nA: Every program in the Software Center is maintained for as long as the distribution is supported. You can check the date limits on Wikipedia.\nHowever, a program is not usually upgraded to a new version, and only bugfixes and security fixes are allowed for as long as you stay on the same Ubuntu release.\nSometimes, when there's a strong reason to do that, updated versions of the packages are published on ubuntu-updates repository (you should have it enabled by default, so don't worry). These updates are usually uploaded after a bug request on Launchpad that gains some popularity. For example, this about Inkscape on karmic.\nThere are some (not too much) exceptions, as Thunderbird and Firefox, that are always updated to new versions.\n", "Q: How do I remove or hide extra icons from Gnome-3 Shell?

You can start it via terminal or the gnome3 menu.\nLink to the Ubuntu Software Center: https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/alacarte/\nIn this program you can disable single programs or \"folders\". To deactivate the low resolution icons, just deactivate the \"Debian\" folder. This worked for me. I'm not sure whether I needed to start it via sudo, better try without first.\n", "Q: How to connect internet across a static IP network? I'm using Ubuntu 10.04 but without internet at home.\nThe reason I think is I have changed my network connections recently to static IP from DHCP because gnuradio needs static IP for accessing external hardware.\nSince then it works in college and I can't access internet at home. \nMy ifconfig eth0 result comes like below:\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr f0:4d:a2:86:5f:0c  \n          inet addr:192.168.1.100  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          UP BROADCAST MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)\n          Interrupt:28 Base address:0xa000 \n\nMy cat /etc/network/interfaces output comes like this:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.100\nnetmask 255.255.255.0\nnetwork 192.168.1.0\nbroadcast 192.168.1.255\ngateway 192.168.1.1\n\nHow can I make it work at home with static IP?\n\nA: It is possible that your home internet does not use 192.168.1.*. You could change the configuration on your router to use 192.168.1.* addresses. You should check the user manual for your router to learn how to do this.\n", "Q: XF86WakeUp keys - where do they come from? $ head -1 /etc/issue && emacs --version | head -1\nUbuntu 12.04.1 LTS \\n \\l\nGNU Emacs 23.3.1\n\nFrom time to time I get undefined messages in the echo area (that do not show up in buffer *Messages*) about XF86WakeUp.

Just to make this clear: Emacs gets Esc directly. Thus, Esc does not mean Soundoff within Emacs. But Fn-Esc does.\nSo what is the clean way to fix this without affecting the other Fn keycombinations within Emacs?\n\nA: This problem is solved most probably due to a recent update of 12.04.\n", "Q: Show window from another display From this question, I learned that I can't move windows between displays. But, can I show the contents of the window on another display somehow? Don't move it, but duplicate the output.\nOn the Bumblebee website is stated that it launches a second X server and uses VirtualGL to show the output of this second server on the other. Couldn't this approach be applied to classic X windows?\n\nA: I just found xpra, which could solve your problem. It starts your program in a virtual xserver (by default xvfb) and allows you to attach the display locally or remote. It describes itself as an screen for X.\nSo all you need to do is\nxpra start :100 --start-child=myprogram\n\non the initial display and\nxpra attach :100\n\non the other display.\n", "Q: How to install and use Ubuntu from a USB flash drive on Windows 8? I'd like to fully install Ubuntu 12.10 onto a 16GB USB 3.0 flash drive, not create a LiveUSB, but to treat the flash drive as an external hard drive. \nI've read it's possible and I know my computer can boot from it. However, it doesn't work when I try. I've booted a LiveUSB from another flash drive and installed Ubuntu onto the 16GB one. It finished successfully, but when I try to boot from it and it takes me straight to Windows 8 instead. I feel I've done something when installing the boot loader.\nIt'd be great if I had some step-by-step instructions for:  \n\n\n*\n\n*how many partitions to make, \n\n*what kind, \n\n*how big, and \n\n*where to install the boot loader.  \n\n\nA: Use the Universal USB Installer to copy your ubuntu ISO file to your USB drive and make it bootable, and on the step 4 you set the amount of space it will use to store the changes, this way it won't revert to the default state when you boot.\n(This software is recommended on the official Ubuntu guide).\n\n\nA: This is almost certainly a Secure Boot issue. The vast majority of Windows 8 computers ship with Secure Boot active, and it will prevent you from booting another OS unless that OS supports Secure Boot. Although Ubuntu 12.10 nominally supports Secure Boot, the statement that another computer was used to prepare the boot medium suggests that it was almost certainly installed without Secure Boot support -- and probably in BIOS mode, as well.\nThe easiest solution is to disable Secure Boot; however, be aware that the procedure to do this varies greatly from one computer to another. You need to dig into your firmware and locate a suitable option, which might or might not have an obvious label or obvious settings.\nWhen you're done, you might need to try both of two boot options in the computer's built-in boot manager.

This file has information about last suspend/hibernate and resume/thaw – and by convention is a good place to add your own logging. It also is a good place to look for errors. If a script fails, it should be logged here.\nA simple script 01_test:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nts=$(date)\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n\"hibernate\"|\"suspend\")\n    printf \"; %s: going down by \\`%s'\\n\" \"$ts\" \"$1\" >> /var/log/pm-suspend.log\n    ;;\n\"resume\"|\"thaw\")\n    printf \"; %s: waking up by \\`%s'\\n\" \"$ts\" \"$1\" >> /var/log/pm-suspend.log\n    ;;\nesac\n\nThen\n$ sudo chmod 755 /etc/pm/sleep.d/01_test\n\nSuspend and wake up, cat log and see:\n$ cat /var/log/pm-suspend.log\n; Sun Jan 13 06:38:14 CET 2013: going down by `suspend'.\n...\n; Sun Jan 13 06:38:19 CET 2013: waking up by `resume'.\n\nOK. That works. Now what you want is to set mouse by xset etc. It would be tempting to believe that a simple line like\nxset m 14/1 1\n\nIn a script in /etc/pm/sleep.d would suffice, but if you try (no harm by trying), you'll see some error in the log file. There is at least two issues. 1: xset require a display 2: root most likely does not have an Xsession.\nTo resolve this one could specify a user environment etc. by adding a line like this instead:\nsu YOUR_USERNAME -c \"xset -display :0 m 14/1 1\"\n\nbut as this is a global script one would presumably do it a bit more complex. This script check for users that are logged in and have an :0 display, check if they have an executable file in /home/user/bin/ named .resume that is executable; if so executes it 01_user_resume:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Time(stamp)\nts=$(date)\n# Log file\nlog=\"/var/log/pm-suspend.log\"\n# Array of Users\n#   Users (finger/who/w ... etc)\n#   Having Xsession (:0)\n#   Unique\ndeclare -a users=($(/usr/bin/finger | \\\n        /bin/grep ':0'| \\\n        /bin/grep -o '^\\w*' | \\\n        /usr/bin/uniq))\n# Array of scritps to look for (using array as it is easy to extend)\ndeclare -a user_scripts_resume=(\".resume\")\n\n# Run resume script fo all users with X session\nrun_user_scripts_resume()\n{\n    local user  # Each user\n    local home  # Users home\n    local scr   # Script to check for and run\n    for user in \"${users[@]}\"; do\n        printf \";; For User: %s.\\n\" \"$user\" >> \"$log\"\n        # Identify users home directory\n        home=$(/usr/bin/getent passwd \"$user\" | cut -d: -f6)\n        # If user has a file called $HOME/bin/<sctipt> and it is \n        # executable then run it\n        for scr in \"${user_scripts_resume[@]}\"; do\n            if [ -f \"$home/bin/$scr\" ] && [ -x \"$home/bin/$scr\" ]; then\n                printf \";;   Executing: $home/bin/$scr\\n\" >> \"$log\"\n                # DISPLAY is needed by e.g. xset\n                /bin/su \"$user\" -c \"export DISPLAY=:0; $home/bin/.resume\"\n            fi\n        done\n    done\n}\n\ncase \"$1\" in\n\"hibernate\"|\"suspend\")\n    printf \"; %s: going down by \\`%s'.\\n\" \"$ts\" \"$1\" >> \"$log\"\n# Nothing to do\n    ;;\n\"resume\"|\"thaw\")\n    printf \"; %s: waking up by \\`%s'.\\n\" \"$ts\" \"$1\" >> \"$log\"\n    printf \"; Executing User resume scripts.\\n\" >> \"$log\"\n    run_user_scripts_resume\n    ;;\nesac\n\nSo: \n\n\n*\n\n*Add that script to a file in /etc/pm/sleep.d/01_user_resume.\n\n*Make it executable: sudo chmod 755 /etc/pm/sleep.d/01_user_resume\nIn your home directory create the file bin/.resume - and add e.g. (err see Edit 2 below):\n#!bin/bash\n\nsleep 3  # See note on EDIT 2: below    \nxset m 15/1 1\n\nMake it executable: chmod 700 bin/.resume\nOr, better, use same script for boot and resume – aka re-run the script you used to set mouse on boot.\nSuspend and resume. Check if settings has changed by:\nxset q\n# or\nxset q | grep -A 1 Pointer\n\n\nEDIT 2: Mouse move\nTesting this it seems like there is yet another problem. The xset q | grep -A 1 Pointer command reveals that the settings are changed, problem is that once the mouse is used - it reverts. For me this was fixed by adding sleep 1 before xset in the .resume script. You might want to use a longer sleep time to be sure.\nChanged so that script was last executed, according to the log file, but this did not help - probably because the scripts seems to be executed in sub-shells - so some process from an earlier script might get executed after last script is executed.\n\nA: To fix suspend/resume issue, I finally resorted to using crontab:\n$ crontab -e\n\n* * * * * DISPLAY=:0 xset m 2 2\n\nI know its not pretty, but it works.\n", "Q: Commanding desktop cube to unfold causes freeze Whenever I enter the key command to unfold the desktop cube (configured in CCSM 0.9.5.92 on Ubuntu 12.04) with ANY command combination (so I'm not sure if this is the common cmnd-alt-down issue) doesn't simply cause CCSM to crash, it freezes up my entire computer.

I'm wondering if this has been done on Linux. I'm also trying to figure out which search terms to use. I searched for 'linux laptop touchpad absolute mode', and came up with an issue with track pad drivers which put the trackpad in absolute mode. but I'm really looking for a program which uses the absolute positions rather than a driver setting.\n\nA: Look at drivers, not applications\nYou won't find a program doing this, because of these three types of touchpads the drivers tries to abstract to a single representation to applications:\n\n\n*\n\n*Touchpads reporting absolute positions data is being translated by the Xorg driver to relative movement for the applications. A regular application can't talk to the touchpad directly (by design), so you really have to look for a solution in the driver.\n\n*Touchpads capable of both relative and absolute modes needs switching of modes, which is very hardware specific and not application-aware.\n\n*Some more basic touchpads don't have the capability of reporting the absolute positions.\n\n\nUnfortunately, even if you have a touchpad pretty much capable of reporting all absolute values, most touchpad drivers do not let you use them in Linux applications. The absolute data is really there, as the driver can detect whether you are touching it at the edges for scrolling for example. Test this for yourself using evtest in a virtual terminal (to suspend X). My Synaptics touchpad reports the absolute positions as follows:\nEvent type 3 (EV_ABS)\n  Event code 0 (ABS_X)\n    Value   3332\n    Min     1472\n    Max     5648\n    Fuzz       8\n    Resolution      39\n  Event code 1 (ABS_Y)\n    Value   2017\n    Min     1408\n    Max     4806\n    Fuzz       8\n    Resolution      79\n\nThe capability of actually putting a Synaptics device in absolute mode in Xorg has been removed recently by this commit in the xf86-input-synaptics driver:\n\nRemove absolute mode\n\nMoving a touchpad in absolute mode is unusual - touchpads are disconnected\nfrom the output device, so direct interaction is hard. There appears to be\nlittle usage of it (I haven't seen bug reports from people claiming to use\nit). Joe Shaw, author of the code and only known user doesn't have a use for\nit anymore, so purge it from the repo.\n\n\nSystem wide basic driver: evdev\nThe only way I see this to be possible at this moment in Linux is using the evdev driver in Xorg. It was discussed back in 2010 on the Xorg mailing list (an excerpt below):\n\n\nI have to get the absolute\n    position of a finger on the touchpad rather than just relative\n    movement.\n\nthe synaptics driver doesn't do this, but the evdev driver does. So\n  you need to configure your X server to use the evdev driver for the\n  touchpad instead. The following configuration snippet will do that for\n  you provided you're running server 1.8 or later.\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"evdev touchpad\"\n    MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n    Driver \"evdev\"\n    Option \"Mode\" \"absolute\"\nEndSection\n\nSave this as /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-evdev-touchpad.conf and restart\n  the server. Note that this only changes the behaviour of the touchpad\n  itself, not the data in the events but then again that data is always\n  absolute anyway. Also, by using evdev instead of synaptics you're\n  losing the ability for two-finger scrolling, tapping, etc.\n\nBottom line: create a feature request\nI see room for a feature request on the upstream bugtracker for the synaptics driver (and possibly others). It would be very much useful to have an interface in Xorg to be able to read the absolute position values of the touchpad. The main blockers I see is that this might be very much hardware specific and therefore hard to implement.\nI think talking to Joe Shaw and Peter Hutterer could also be of great value to see what the history in this is exactly, how to make it a great feature request and what to expect from it.\n\nA: https://pypi.org/project/fingerpaint/\nuse\npip install fingerpaint\n\nto install it\nit needs\npython3-tkinter\npython3-libevdev\npython3-devel\npackages too\nthen run fingerpaint -o out.png and start drawing\n\nA: That highly depends on the hardware I think.. Your trackpad needs to support giving away the absolute position of a touch. A normal laptop trackpad acts more like a mouse, only providing direction, speed and acceleration information. So wherever you touch, it will only move from the current direction of the cursor.\n", "Q: Files disappear when removing pendrive System updated the next day booted by the kernel that was installed.

It's not supported in the stable Ubuntu Linux kernels at the time of writing. A patch to enable support on it has been submitted: Patchwork Bluetooth: Add support for BCM20702A0 [04ca, 2003] in September 2012.\nTry a more recent kernel and it should just work. I'm running Linux 3.7.3 and it's supported:\nmodinfo btusb | grep -i 04CA.2003\nalias:          usb:v04CAp2003d*dc*dsc*dp*ic*isc*ip*in*\n\nSee my answer for wireless LAN issues step 6 (Try the latest stable Linux kernel) on how to upgrade your kernel to a more recent one.\nWhy do I see it using rfkill then?\nKillswitch support is something completely different than support of the device behind this switch. The message about Bluetooth being disabled may be a bit misleading. The application assumes the bluetooth adapter device to appear once it has unlocked the killswitch. In your case, the adapter isn't supported, so that explains why it doesn't show up.\nThe dmesg output always shows traces of Bluetooth as that's just the generic kernel module initializing for general Bluetooth support in the kernel. It has nothing to do with your Bluetooth adapter at that point.\nPlease report this as a bug\nPlease also open a bug on the Ubuntu bugtracker against the linux package to get support for this backported in the Quantal release kernel.

You can have a maximum of four primary partitions, and you appear to be at that number.  In order to create more partitions, you'll need to delete one of those partitions (probably sda4), and then create a new extended partition, which you can divide into logical partitions.\n", "Q: Is it possible for Conky to display Time in words and not in numbers? I want to have Conky display the time using words and not numbers.\nWhat I want to do is more or less how the Pebble Watch looks (Red watch).\n\nLike in the image, even if only the time and not the date can be shown.\nIs this possible?\n\nA: Lua scripting solution\nThis is indeed possible using Lua scripting. You can use the script below (the number conversion is taken from rosettacode.org).\nThe script can do a boring option, which will translate 12:45 to \"twelve forty-five\", and an awesome option which will translate it to \"a quarter to one\". It also does a Uri Herrera option which does the hour bold ;)\nAlso it automatically refreshes, when the time changes.\nwords = {\"one \", \"two \", \"three \", \"four \", \"five \", \"six \", \"seven \", \"eight \", \"nine \"}\nlevels = {\"thousand \", \"million \", \"billion \", \"trillion \", \"quadrillion \", \"quintillion \", \"sextillion \", \"septillion \", \"octillion \", [0] = \"\"}\niwords = {\"ten \", \"twenty \", \"thirty \", \"forty \", \"fifty \", \"sixty \", \"seventy \", \"eighty \", \"ninety \"}\ntwords = {\"eleven \", \"twelve \", \"thirteen \", \"fourteen \", \"fifteen \", \"sixteen \", \"seventeen \", \"eighteen \", \"nineteen \"}\n\nfunction digits(n)\n  local i, ret = -1\n  return function()\n    i, ret = i + 1, n % 10\n    if n > 0 then\n      n = math.floor(n / 10)\n      return i, ret\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nlevel = false\nfunction getname(pos, dig)\n  level = level or pos % 3 == 0\n  if(dig == 0) then return \"\" end\n  local name = (pos % 3 == 1 and iwords[dig] or words[dig]) ..

You'll need a script that takes in numbers and outputs words. A lot of frameworks like Django have this feature, but you might be on your own unless there's an equivalent Lua library for it:\nfunction conky_translate_number(number) {\n    if (number == 1) { \n        return \"one\";\n    } else {\n        return \"not a clue\";\n    }\n}\n\nYou may just simply want to write a Python script which leverages Django for the translation using its templating language. \n\nA: you can write a python script for this using pynum2word library available at this sourceforge page \nBasically what it does is:  \n>>> import num2word\n>>> num2word.to_card(10)\n'ten'\n>>> num2word.to_card(100)\n'one hundred'\n>>> num2word.to_card(1025)\n'one thousand and twenty-five'\n\na trivial example is what I did here:\n>>> import datetime\n>>> import num2word\n>>> now = datetime.datetime.now()\n>>> t = datetime.time(now.hour, now.minute, now.second).strftime('%H:%M:%S').split(':')\n>>> print \"%s hours %s minutes and %s seconds\" %(num2word.to_card(t[0]), num2word.to_card(t[1]), num2word.to_card(t[2]))\n>>> two hours thirty one minutes and fifteen seconds\n\nNow to make this rendered by conky, create a directory inside your conky config directory e.g. ~/.conky/pyscripts/ and put pynum2word library inside it, now create another file say timeToWord and put this script into this file:\n#!/bin/python\nimport datetime\nimport num2word\nnow = datetime.datetime.now()\nt = datetime.time(now.hour, now.minute, now.second).strftime('%H:%M:%S').split(':')\nprint \"%s hours %s minutes and %s seconds\" %(num2word.to_card(t[0]), num2word.to_card(t[1]), num2word.to_card(t[2]))\n\nYou can change the formatting of time and include the date too, if you want. For formatting options have a look at this page.\nthen open the conky config file /etc/conky/conky.conf and put this line somewhere:\n{execpi 30 ~/.conky/pyscripts/timeToWord}\n\nWhat this line does is, it execute the script file every 30 seconds and update the output on conky window.  \nOf course you can freely place the script files in any directory but make sure the pynum2word library is in same directory.  \n\nA: Couldn't you create a symbol-font which consists of images of the written word for every numeral? Than you should just have to choose this font (if possible) for the display of time.\n", "Q: Moving home/user directory to another drive? I'm installing a SSD and to save space I want to move my user folder to another drive, is there a way to do that?\n\nA: From Terminal type this:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/tmp\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/tmp\n\nwhich will allow you to temporarily mount the new partition, assuming /sdb1 as new partition for HOME.\nsudo rsync -avx /home/ /mnt/tmp\n\nThis will copy HOME to new location.\nsudo mount /dev/sdb1 /home\n\nThis will mount the new partition as HOME and make sure all data is present.\nsudo umount /home  \n\nThis will unmount the new partion.\nrm -rf /home/*  \n\nThis deletes the old HOME.\nTo make HOME permanent you need to know the UUID of the new partition for the fstab entry. you can get that by giving command:\nsudo blkid\n\nNote down the UUID and use the same to change fstab .\nsudo nano /etc/fstab   \n\nNow add the following at the end.\nUUID=<noted number from above>    /home    ext4    defaults   0  2\n\nNOTE: You need to select the exact file system that was formatted (for example ext4 as chosen here).\nNow you can restart your computer to see the new HOME.\n\nA: Copy all the files from your /home to another drive\nChange the /etc/fstab entry to point /home to that drive\nIf you don't how, reply.

Such installation works fine on the machine on which it was created, but on any other machine everything just hangs up after loading the initial ramdisk.

Then I tried Alexonlinux's method using Port 19999 and again it works fine.\nThe reason I can't stick to Alexonlinux's solution is, that it requires some commands to be entered on the PC behind the NAT, and that's not possible in my case.\nI really wonder what could be stopping the connection when using Fabelier's method.

It works for me - I have remote/unattended devices behind firewall and routing owned by other companies. Instead of having to work with them to expose my ssh port to the world via port forwarding so I can access the devices, I wanted to be able to use Reverse SSH. So built my own little system to get around that.\nThe server side runs a PHP & MySQL based website. I can click on a device and go to it's page. I click \"Reverse SSH\" button, which puts the command \"Reverse SSH\" into the database with the device ID.\nOn the client side, I have a python script that runs every minute via crontab. Everytime it runs, it reports the system health info, cpu load, memory, disk space, etc via HTTP to the server. During that HTTP transaction, if a command is waiting for the device that checked in, I send the command back. The client side then matches that command, and executes a call to bash \"expect /path/to/client/reversessh.expect\".\nThe expect script is prefilled with my server ssh info (yeah, I know it's \"insecure\", but it works for now.), and establishes the Reverse SSH connection for up to 1 hour (you can set it to longer if you need). I can then log into the remote device from my locality.\nThe server I am running is Ubuntu Server 14.04, and the remote devices range from beaglebone black and virtual servers to desktop Pc's, RPi and RPi2.\nOn the debian based systems, I install expect via apt-get:\napt-get install expect\nHere is the expect script, modify it as needed. It might take a moment to get it working but it does work. I hope the formatting doesn't get messed up, it is hard to copy and paste a large code block like this and get it to turn out right:\nExample reversssh.expect\n#!/usr/bin/expect -f\n#Author: g0 2010 , kod.ipduh.com \n#License:Same as Expect - Public Domain\n#revtun sets up a reverse ssh tunnel  \n#ssh example: ssh -R 1025:localhost:22 -p 443 user@192.0.2.123 -fN\n#Hardcode the arguments or pass them at this order on the command line\n#eg:$revtun 1025 22 443 user 192.0.2.123 password http://kod.ipduh.com\n\nset remoteport \"1234\" # this is the port on your server that will serve the tunnel\nset localport \"22\" # ssh port of remote/target device\nset port \"2222\" # This is the port in which the remote device will ssh into your server.

If you have other SSH connections going on, checking sshd may not work for you. Since this Reverse SSH script is the only SSH activity on the remote devices, it works for me. In my system, I can kill the Reverse SSH connection on a device by shooting off another command to the remote device when it checks in, \"Disconnect Reverse SSH\", and that causes the client side to run this command with bash:\nkill `pidof sshd`\n\nEdit your crontab with:\n    crontab -e\nThe first 6 lines of the crontab file below are nice to specify, you may want to edit them to your liking.\nExample crontab\nMAILTO=\"\" # local mail address to get cron messages, leave blank to disable\nSHELL=/bin/bash \nUSER=root # run these cron jobs as root user\nPATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin\nHOME=/root # root users home dir\nLOGNAME=root\n\n# Example check reverse SSH connection - runs every minute\n* * * * * bash /path/to/check_reverse_ssh.bash\n\nExample check_reverse_ssh.bash\n#!/bin/bash\nprocess_id=`ps aux | grep \"sshd\" | grep -v \"grep\"`\nif [ -z \"$process_id\" ]; then\n    echo \"process not running for certain.\"\n    expect /path/to/reversessh.expect &\nelse \n    echo \"sshd is running, If so, your tunnel should be good to go\";\nfi\n\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How to get wide character fonts on KDE?

This can lead to certain websites working incorrectly even though all others work fine. It will appear as a time out rather than connection refused. It will only show up with reasonably large transfers like whole webpages - telnet will probably not send any packets which need to be fragmented. It can affect outgoing ssh too.\nThe fix is to lower the MTU on your network device so that packets above a certain size are always fragmented. See for example:\nhttp://tldp.org/HOWTO/Adv-Routing-HOWTO/lartc.cookbook.mtu-discovery.html\nIn detail what happens is that when you send data over the internet it is split up into packets. The maximum size for these packets anywhere on the internet is 1460 bytes not including headers. If you send a message large than that it must be split up, or fragmented.\nNow, if your message goes over certain types of internet links it must be encapsulated in another protocol. That means that the packet including headers will get wrapped inside another packet. That obviously increases the size of the packet, so if your packet is already maximum size it must be split up again. However, because this can be exploited to perform DDoS attacks, many routers won't automatically fragment packets that they didn't create. Therefore your maximum size packets won't cross these routers.\nIn order to avoid this problem MTU path discovery was invented. If a packet is too big for a router it will send back a message saying to send smaller packets. However, it turns out this could be exploited too, and so many routers won't do that either.\nSo the way to overcome this problem is to always send packets slightly smaller than the absolute maximum. That's what the MTU setting is for. The idea is to set it just small enough that any extra overhead doesn't put you over the limit. Of course you won't know how small that is so you have to find the optimal value (biggest value that still works) by experimentation.\n\nA: From what I have seen of your curl output, you can access it.\nIf you can't see it on your browser, try with another browser. \nMy curl output.\ncurl -I http://imgur.com\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: nginx\nDate: Sat, 12 Jan 2013 03:21:00 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html\nConnection: keep-alive\nCache-Control: max-age=5, s-maxage=5, must-revalidate\nX-Cached: HIT\n\n", "Q: Shell script to -9 kill based on name Is there a way (perhaps a script) how to automate this process:\npetr@sova:~$ ps -ef | grep middleman\npetr     18445  2312  1 12:06 pts/2    00:00:01 /home/petr/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.3-p362/bin/middleman                                                                  \npetr     18581 13621  0 12:08 pts/0    00:00:00 grep --color=auto middleman\npetr@sova:~$ kill -9 18445\n\nUnfortunately, pkill is too weak as I have to go with -9 option on kill.\n\nA: There is an even simpler solution than the one of qbi: killall let's you kill processes by name, and you can specify signals. \nkillall -9 middleman\n\nSee man killall for more information and extra options (there are quite a few).\nAs the name suggests, this does send the signal to all processes named middleman. But that's not different from other ways (like pkill). Furthermore, pkill -9 middleman will target processes whose name match but do not equal middleman, such as middleman2, as well.\n\nA: You can use your shell to do this task for you:\nkill -9 $(pidof middleman)\n\nThe shell executes the command pidof middleman first. The output of pidof(8) is the process id. So the shell substitutes the pidof-command with the process id and executes kill -9 18845 (or whatever the correct process id is).\n\nA: The other answers are entirely correct, but I might as well add a third option so all are documented here. You can also use:\npkill -9 middleman\n\nSee man pkill for more information and extra options.\nIt doesn't really matter which of these methods you use. They will all work. But knowing the options if useful if you want to modify the behaviour in some way, since the corresponding man pages show what other matching options are available.\n\nA: Just for fun, I'd like to add a more manual, old school way\nkill -9 `ps aux | grep middleman | awk '{print $2}'`\n\n\nA: pkill -9 -f middleman\n\nThe -f option makes it match the complete command line, rather than only the process name.\nNote that -9 should be a last resort signal, not something to use routinely.\n\nA: killall -9 -ir regex_pattern\n\nwhich is interactive(safe) and matches the partial command name.\n", "Q: #!/usr/bin/php sometimes not working on 12.10 server I've recently moved some working code from a 12.04 server to a 12.1 server.\nEverything working well except....\nSome of my scripts include\n#!/usr/bin/php -q \nat the top so I can run them from the command line without explicitly invoking php/.\nSome of these work find, some others do not work at all - \nI get the error message:\nException: Zend Extension ./makeTracks.php does not exist\n\nThere is a correct link from /usr/bin/php to etc/alternatives/php and then on to /usr/bin/php5\nI don't know if something changed between 12.04 and 12.10 that is causing this or what else might cause it.

That or the latest LTS (long term support) version if you'd rather not upgrade more than every 2 years.\nThe only exception would be if your hardware falls significantly below the recommended minimum stats for the latest release.  In which case, instead of installing an older version of Ubuntu, I'd recommend opting for a different distribution.\nUbuntu (and most Linux distributions) can run on a surprisingly low specced machine.  512MB RAM and a 20MB hard drive, for example, is absolutely fine (and I even run full graphical Ubuntu in VMs with these specs).\nYour system is more than enough to support Ubuntu, and probably many future versions of Ubuntu too.\nI wouldn't go installing an old version of Ubuntu specifically to better support old hardware.  If you pick a version that is no longer supported, you are leaving yourself vulnerable to known security vulnerabilities which are patched in later versions.\n", "Q: unable to install Ubuntu12.10 on DELL inspiron 14z Ultrabook? \nPossible Duplicate:\n“No root file system defined” error while installing ubuntu \n\nI am unable to install Ubuntu12.10 on my DELL inspiron 14z Ultrabook??\nwhen i tried, it is saying something like \"root directory not defined\"\n\nA: What partitioning method are you using during the install? Install alongside Windows or Something Else. \nIf your using Something Else you need to set up the partitions like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ext4 filesystem mounted as /. This will be your root directory. (15-20 GB should be plenty.)\n\n*Ext4 filesystem mounted as /home. This will be your home directory where all your documents, pictures, music etc. will be installed.\n\n*swap area filesystem for the Swap partition (Once you select swap area the mount point option will be grayed out).

Sometimes terminal opens on a first try.\nThis is a very annoying situation.\nI also noted that open rate increases when I click on random spot on my desktop when all windows are hidden.\nAlso, when terminal finally is open, next Ctrl+Alt+T combinations open new terminal window immediately.\nThere are no loadings when combination does not work, which means terminal will not appear even if I wait.\nUbuntu 12.10\nCurrent computer:\nASUS P5K-E/Wifi-AP MB, CPU Q6600 Quad Core @ 2.4ghz, GFX GTX560Ti, DDR2 RAM @ 800mhz 4gb\nWhat am I doing wrong? Maybe there is some \"focus\" in shortkeys, global shortkeys, etc?\n\nA: It may actually be working the first time, and is just taking a long time to appear.  Try first opening System Monitor from the dash, and watching what happens when you hit Ctrl - Alt - T. \nYou can watch for CPU/memory spikes or for the process name (gnome-terminal, bash) to show up in the list.  If that happens right away, then you know it's not a keyboard problem.\nYou may also be able to use 'xev' to debug whether the keys are being sent correctly.  \nMy guess is that there is something in your .bash startup scripts that is doing a network lookup or something else slow, which is delaying the terminal's appearance. \n\nA: Seems to happen if the gnome-keyring-daemon is ill-configured or there are two instances of it. Try verifying that the daemon is indeed running, and that the output of $ ps aux | grep keyring is somewhat similar to this:\nuser     2775 … /usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon --daemonize --login\nuser     4501 … /usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon --start --foreground --components=secrets\nuser     8808 … grep --color=auto -i keyring\n\nIf there are e.g. two processes started with the --daemonize --login arguments, you may have encountered a bug, one symptom being what you describe.\n\nA: this going to sound silly but you actually have to press CTRL + ALT first and hold them and then press T at least a second holding both and then the third.\n", "Q: How can I play video file with .vmw extension?

I have already read a similar question about this card and none of them helped me to solve this problem.\n\nA: I dont think FGLRX will work. I think it will not even show on the restricted drivers section either. In my humble opinion, stick with the open source drivers. It will work without problem. But you can overclock or downclock your card using Rovclock app on software center.

Check /etc/xdg/autostart/ for examples. You can make a copy of the existing .desktop file, rename it and modify for your needs. You can also add X-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=XX parameter to set XX seconds delay for your task. If you need to add this only for the selected user, use ~/.config/autostart/ of that user to place your .desktop file and check with gnome-session-properties that this launcher is active.\nIn order to send the notification on terminal or ssh login you can use the script placed to /etc/profile.d/ or send this notification, adding echo \"My Message\" to /etc/bash.bashrc directly. Both of them are called from /etc/profile and will be run on every login to interactive shell, be it virtual terminal or ssh login. For the selected user use ~/.bash_login of that user and put the desired message there. Note: usage of /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bash_login makes sense if the default bash shell is used; if the user invokes some other shell, for example /bin/sh/, these files will be ignored.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS stopped detecting BCM4312 on DELL E6500 I have been using wireless seamlessly since I upgraded to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

I would like to install Ubuntu 11.04 on it, but I cannot boot the live CD. There is an SSD and HHD on the machine, but no operating systems are installed on it. System has UEFI architecture, and on the BIOS, CD/DVD drive appears under both UEFI Boot Sources and Legacy Boot Sources.\n\nA: According to HP's Web site, this computer ships with Windows 8. Therefore, it almost certainly ships with Secure Boot active. Ubuntu 11.04 was released well before Ubuntu added Secure Boot support to its OS (with version 12.10), so to get Ubuntu 11.04's installer to boot, you'll need to disable Secure Boot. (Note that the procedures to do so vary greatly from one computer to another; the reference describes how to do it on one computer, but yours is almost certain to be different.)\nAlso, Ubuntu 11.04 is nearly two years old, and it has some very serious EFI-related bugs, such as this one. What's more, it's so old that it likely lacks drivers necessary for a brand-new computer. Therefore, I strongly recommend against installing Ubuntu 11.04 on your system. Instead, you should try 12.10, or at the very least 12.04LTS if you want an LTS edition -- but given the fact that you're installing on such a new computer, 12.10 is likely to be a better choice.\n", "Q: How to boost mplayer (SMPlayer) sound (in Lubuntu)? \n*\n\n*I am thinking of the useful feature present in the MPUI video player (mplayer for windows) that can enable volume boost to impressive levels (not from the volume slider, but just from the mouse scroll).\n\n\n*In L/ubuntu I use VLC for the same purpose - normally up to 200%.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*I have found this and this related questions that imply overall volume boost and do not specify the desktop environment, which usually means they are Gnome-Unity specific. \nI think the answers related to using the volume properties in order to boost overall volume above 100% is useful in LXDE/Lubuntu too, as Pulseaudio Volume Control can be used in LXDE.\n\nBut I would like to know if there's a way to do that with mplayer/smplayer - to get more boost.\nI thought that maybe mplayer would do in Ubuntu/Lubuntu at least what it can do in Windows. But how? \n\nA: This is more of a complement to the question but it can stand as a partial answer or workaround.\nPulseaudio Volume Control (not installed by default in Ubuntu, to install go to pavucontrol  ) would display  the audio player/module that is runing and increase that.\nSo, VLC, already playing at 200%, can get a supplementary boost\n\nAnd from what I see the sound is not distorted.\nAlso while playing SMPlayer.\n\nThis involves directly the mplayer module.\nI guess that this solution can be added to the other answer (that i'll set as the permanent to the question \"how to boost audio in smplayer\").\n\nA: Open SMPlayer, go to Options > Preferences. Under General, click the tab Audio.\nThere should be an option Use software volume control and next to it the maximum amplification.

Or better two. This may take a while. Ideally, all further operations should be on the \"mirrors\" of your drive, not on the live data.\n\n*Try using TestDisk as already has been advised. Here's an article illustrating how to recover a damaged MBR using TestDisk, the key part is to use \"Analyze current partition structure...\" option - however, I would suggest to operate on a data snapshot, not on a live drive.\n\n\n\nBasically, if you read Wikipedia articles on MBR and GPT you'll see that the whole problem is caused by the GPT replacing 4 primary partition records in the MBR with a \"fake\" partition type EEh. Each primary partition record is 16 bytes, so the total damage is likely to be just 64 bytes, you could've just edited the data by hand in a hex editor if you knew exactly what the partitions were.\n\nA: This may help you, although I will profess to not being an expert in the MBR, TrueCrypt etc. : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreUbuntu/XP/Vista/7Bootloader\nEDIT: following on from Web-E's comment, this link refers to the use of TestDisk to rebuild the partition table: \n\n\"TestDisk (http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk) can be used to\n  rebuild MBR / partitions (available in SystemRescueCd\n  (http://www.sysresccd.org/Main_Page), which seems to be a good distro\n  for system rescue.)\"\n\n", "Q: How do I fix \"mdadm: /dev/sdc1 not large enough to join array\" for three identical discs?

Than you need to reboot your computer an add disk to RAID\n\nA: Ok, what's going on is that you originally built the array with the whole disks, without any partitions.  It looks like you may have later added a partition table, which kind of corrupts the array.  You can't add the disk partition now because it is too small since mdadm expects the whole disk.\nThe errors you see from grub are due to the fact that with the 0.9 metadata format, it can not tell if the raid metadata is supposed to apply to the whole disk, or the partition.  You should rebuild the array using the newer metadata format, and preferably partition the individual disks first this time.\n", "Q: Perl doesn't include directory I have a problem with perl5 with ubuntu.\nI've got a script, in which I include several directories.

I'm using Ubuntu 12.10 and I have been trying to make my new keyboard (Logitech K810) and Nokia Phone 700, work with my Thinkpad T410. It just does not work. I have tried the instructions mentioned over here but it still doesn't work.\nAs for the phone it says that the phone is paired but then gives an error message when I try to transfer files and unexpectedly shuts down.\nAny solutions? I'm desperate to make this keyboard work, and I really don't want to revert to Windows!\n\nA: Transfering files to an Ubuntu system requires the Obex demon obexpushd to be up and running which is not the case by default. Which is a pity because it renders bluetooth file transfer useless for most users (Ubuntu should start the demon by default - at least if there is a bluetooth device present).\nAs for the keyboard - I couldn't pair it either. But I manage to use it anyway by:\nhidd --search\n\nThe biggest drawback is that the connectin lasts unil reboot. One has to press the pairing key on the keyboard each time. Not good. Even worse - I do not know if the connection is encrypted.

How to uninstall the Grub and restore the Windows 8 system with secure boot and UEFI?\n\nA: Simply use this tool from a live disc: OS-Uninstaller\n\n\nA: I recommend the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from an emergency system (Ubuntu in \"live CD\" mode, PartedMagic, System Rescue CD, or whatever).\n\n*Mount your EFI System Partition (ESP). This is often (but not always) /dev/sda1. It's always a FAT32 partition that has its \"boot flag\" set (in parted terminology) or a partition type code of EF00 (in gdisk terminology).\n\n*Launch a shell and change to the ESP.\n\n*Type sudo rm -rf EFI/ubuntu. (You can omit sudo on some systems.)\n\n*If you ever used Boot Repair on the disk, undo its damage:\n\n*\n\n*Change to EFI/Microsoft/Boot on the ESP.\n\n*Move bootmgfw.efi.bkp to bootmgfw.efi, overwriting the existing file.\n\n*Change to EFI/BOOT on the ESP.\n\n*Move bootx64.efi.bkp to bootx64.efi, overwriting the existing file.\n\n\n*Launch GParted, parted, gdisk, or cgdisk on the disk.\n\n*Delete the Linux partition(s).\n\n*Optional: Resize the Windows partition(s) to fill the disk. It's probably best to skip this if you intend to do a fresh re-install of Ubuntu, since you'll just undo this change shortly.\n\n*Reboot into Windows to test that it still works. This will probably also clear out the EFI's NVRAM entries for Ubuntu.\n\n\nA: Insert windows repair disk to restore the startup (grub).

I removed Ubuntu and all the partitions I created for it. I booted into a Ubuntu Live-USB and opened the LSR partition created by windows which is filled with EFI files. I found and deleted all mentions of grub and a couple of other files and it removed grub from the startup. Hope that helps, it was more of a trial and error, there are a couple of files that don't belong which you need to delete and it will work fine.\n\nA: You can just do it as you would if UEFI and \"Secure Boot\" were not involved, but re-enable \"Secure Boot\" in your firmware (\"BIOS\") before installing Windows. It might be even simpler though, depending on what you have set up right now and what you want to acccomplish.\nUbuntu supports (but does not require) \"Secure Boot,\" so if you are dual-booting Ubuntu and Windows 8, you likely already have \"Secure Boot\" enabled, especially if it is the stock, OEM-provided Windows 8 installation. If that is the case, then there is no difference at all between the usual procedures for removing Ubuntu and making Windows bootable, and your situation.\nIf you just have Ubuntu installed now, and you want to remove Ubuntu, enable \"Secure Boot,\" and just have Windows 8 installed (at least for the time being), then it is very simple. Just do one of the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wipe your disk (for example, by running GParted from an Ubuntu live CD and telling it to create a new partition table), enable \"Secure Boot,\" and install Windows 8. Or:\n\n*Skip wiping your disk, enable \"Secure Boot,\" install Windows 8, and tell Windows 8's installer to wipe the disk (or delete all existing partitions). Windows installers have been capable of this for the last several Windows OSes.\n\n\nIf Windows 8 is already installed in a way that does not need \"Secure Boot\" (for example, a 32-bit Windows 8 installation), then probably it too will not work when Secure Boot is enabled. In that case, you would probably have to remove both Ubuntu and Windows 8, to enable \"Secure Boot.\" So for that situation, you can just wipe your disk, enable \"Secure Boot,\" and install Windows 8.\n(Alternatively, if you wanted to try to make a non-\"Secure Boot\" Windows 8 installation work with \"Secure Boot,\" or a \"Secure Boot\" Windows 8 installation work without it, you could ask about that somewhere Windows question that don't relate much to Ubuntu is supported. Super User is often good for that. But from your description, it doesn't seem like that's what you're trying to do.)\n", "Q: How to boot as root without password on a headless Ubuntu 11.04? I'm using a Pandaboard as a closed system (no Ethernet, wireless, or display) which runs ubuntu 11.04 server edition. I have a external power switch and I would like to boot up the system with this switch and launch a program automatically. That means I need to get around the login procedure. On top I need sudo rights to launch the program. \nWould be great to get your help.\nSide question: At the moment I login in as a normal user and use $sudo su to get root rights. But when I want to login as root directly it says that my password is incorrect. How is that possible?  \n\nA: Have you set the root password yet? On default ubuntu installations, the root password usually isn't set. You could set it by sudo passwd. And then use that password for logging in as root. And as for the first part of your question, you could add the program to init scripts and it will run automatically on startup witout any login at all.\n", "Q: How to Install Oracle 10gR2 EE database on Ubuntu 12.04 I've been able to install an Oracle 11gR2 EE database on Ubuntu 12.04 by using a tutorial found online.

I want to convert a .pdf file to an .odt file so that I can further convert it to a .doc file. Is there any software/script that can do this. I have tried to copy the content of the .pdf file and paste it in LibreOffice Writer but the formatting isn't preserved.\nThe document is confidential so I'd prefer not to use any on-line service for the conversion.\nAny help is highly appreciated.\n\nA: Try Calibre. It converts to html and then into other formats. It did a pretty good job on a large (183 pages) file I would have otherwise had to print.\nIn my case I converted it to an epub, but for fun just converted it to a .docx which turned out very well.\n\nA: If the poppler-utils package is installed, a file manager script including a command like the one below will help convert PDF file to HTML (the option \"-i\" can be deleted to include images as well), which can then be opened with LibreOffice Writer and saved as ODT although the success of formatting conversion depends very much on how PDF is created.\npdftohtml -noframes -q -s -c -i -p -noframes <filename>\n\n\nA: You could take a look at PDF Utilities (poppler-utils via Synaptic or apt-get) which includes pdftotext:\n\nPoppler is a PDF rendering library based on Xpdf PDF viewer.\nThis package contains command line utilities (based on Poppler) for getting\n  information of PDF documents, convert them to other formats, or manipulate\n  them:\n   * pdfdetach -- lists or extracts embedded files (attachments)\n   * pdffonts -- font analyzer\n   * pdfimages -- image extractor\n   * pdfinfo -- document information\n   * pdfseparate -- page extraction tool\n   * pdftocairo -- PDF to PNG/JPEG/PDF/PS/EPS/SVG converter using Cairo\n   * pdftohtml -- PDF to HTML converter\n   * pdftoppm -- PDF to PPM/PNG/JPEG image converter\n   * pdftops -- PDF to PostScript (PS) converter\n   * pdftotext -- text extraction\n   * pdfunite -- document merging tool  \n\nOf course, success will depend on how the pdf file was generated.

It's from the description tab in Synaptic for PDF Utilities (based on Poppler).\n\nA: I was annoyed by the lack of a free PDF to ODT converter too. I didn't even need anything complicated. Just a tool that generates ODT files that I can then annotate in LibreOffice (e.g. to fill out forms).\nI know how to do this manually, by converting the PDF document into graphics files and then importing them into LibreOffice, but that gets tedious quite fast.\nSo, I finally wrote a quick little shell script that does all the required steps automatically. You can find it at https://github.com/gutschke/pdf2odt\nIt can take any number of PDF and image files as input and generates a ODT file that can be opened and edited in LibreOffice. Images show up as page background, so you can write over them freely. Each image is associated with its own page style. Keep that in mind, when inserting page breaks and adjust the page style as necessary.\nI tested the script on both Linux and Mac. Given that it only needs a handful of reasonably standard tools, it should be quite portable.\n\nA: LibreOffice is capable of importing .pdf files. Simply open it in a current version of LibreOffice for best results. It will, however, open the document as a drawing, and you will be able to convert it only to one of the supported image formats, not as a Writer document.\nNaturally, not all formatting is preserved, but at least some. \n", "Q: I cannot copy and paste between window and ubuntu with LXDE desktop I installed VNC in the VPS with Ubuntu OS, then I installed LXDE desktop.\nI remoted to the desktop of VPS via VNC, then I tried to copy between my Windows computer and the VPS, but it did not work.\nI tried to search many articles in askubuntu.com and also in google.com but I cound not find the answer.\nWhen I tried the comand vncconfig in the VPS, it did not work, it says:\n-bash: vncconfig: command not found\n\nI tried to remote VPS via both ways: tightvnc and realvnc, but no luck.\nCan you tell me how do I fix it now?\n\nA: I fixed the proplem, so I think I can answer my question for myself\nTHe proplem is from tightvnc\nI tried to reinstall the VPS with same desktop LXDE, but then, I installed vnc4server, and now I can copy + paste between window pc and linux desktop\nthanks you!\n", "Q: Intermitent Facebook connection on Empathy I'm using Empathy on Ubuntu 12.04 (32 bits) to connect to \"people near me\", gtalk and facebook.

However, the dual boot menu did not pop up upon reboot. It loaded Windows directly. (Secure boot & rapid technologies are disabled). \nAfter some research & forum reading, we verified that Ubuntu was indeed present in the EFI partition and we ran boot-repair. Eventually, the boot menu appeared, but it did so at every second reboot (from a shutdown not a restart). Then, it disappeared again and the laptop goes directly into Windows. \nWhen the dual boot menu appeared, we went into Ubuntu and life was good so the installation  -or some parts of it- worked... But how do i now get the dual boot menu to appear as it's supposed to? \nFurthermore, I read that with Windows 8 the dual boot menu becomes graphical... But we just had the regular old list. \nAny tips?? \nThanks! \n\nA: As I read it, GRUB isn't appearing at all when you boot; the computer is booting straight into Windows. If so, you probably need to use the Windows bcdedit program from a Command Prompt window started with Administrator privileges:\nbcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\n\nBe sure to type that command precisely. Note the difference between slashes (/) and backslashes (\\), and note that the curly braces ({bootmgr}) don't denote a variable; type them as-is.\nNote also that GRUB is not part of Windows, so its appearance doesn't change with Windows 8. Windows does come with its own boot loader, but AFAIK, on UEFI systems, it's really only useful for selecting between different Windows installations; it can't redirect the boot process to another OS. If you want a graphical boot manager, look into my rEFInd, which can redirect to the Windows boot loader (which will boot Windows directly) or to GRUB (which can boot Linux automatically or present its own menu, depending on its configuration). With 3.3.0 and later kernels, rEFInd can boot them directly, bypassing GRUB; but Ubuntu 12.04 ships with 3.2.0 kernels, so you'll need to upgrade your kernel if you want to use rEFInd without GRUB.\n\nA: *\n\n*Disable FastBoot / QuickBoot in your BIOS  (it may also be possible to disable it from within Windows)\n\n*Reboot your pc\n\n", "Q: Can I change file systems inside of partitions within GParted?

Initial boot into 12.04 on newworld ppc mac. b43 driver is missing. To run the live CD I booted with b43.blacklist=yes install went fine. Now I am stuck at boot. I want to boot regular Linux (as it's installed, not the live CD), just without loading load b43. I don't know how to tell it to do that.\nIs it something like boot Linux b43.blacklist=yes? linux b43...? How should I do this?\n\nA: You can either make the boot loader give the b43.blacklist=yes option to the kernel automatically, or you can add the b43 module to the blacklist file.\nBooting b43.blacklist=yes Every Time\nAll boot options are set the same way, so you can follow these instructions but with b43.blacklist=yes instead of nomodeset. Or you may prefer this excellent guide. (Or this.)\nTo summarize, here's an essentially identical way to what's given in those sources:\n\n\n*\n\n*Hold down Shift while booting. When the GRUB menu comes up, press e to temporarily edit the first entry. Add b43.blacklist=yes to the end of the line that begins with linux, then press Ctrl+X to boot.\n\n*Once booted and logged in, open a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run these commands to back up and edit your boot loader configuration:\nsudo cp /etc/default/grub /etc/default/grub.old\ngksu gedit /etc/default/grub\n\n\n*In the text editor that opens up, find the line that says:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nChange it so it says:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash b43.blacklist=yes\"\n\nSave the file and quit the text editor.\n\n*Back in the Terminal, run sudo update-grub. Once that's done, reboot to verify it's working.\nIf you ever need to undo the change, you can run gedit /etc/default/grub and remove b43.blacklist=yes from that line, or you can restore the backup (overwriting the new file) with sudo cp /etc/default/grub.old /etc/default/grub. Either way, you must run sudo update-grub again to apply the changes.\nAdding the b43 Module to the Blacklist File\nCustom boot options are not the only way to prevent kernel modules form loading. Another way is to add them to the blacklist file. Usually, this file does not exist initially, and you must create it.\nA complete, general procedure is here. But you can follow this shorter procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot using Step 1 above (under Booting b43.blacklist=yes Every Time).\n\n*Open a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run:\necho blacklist b43 | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-b43.conf\n\n\n*Reboot to verify it works.\nIf at some point you want to undo this, you can run sudo rm /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-b43.conf. (Then to load the b43 module, you'd reboot, or run sudo modprobe b43. You're unlikely to want to do that though, since as you said you don't have the b43 module at all.)\n", "Q: trying to install 12.10 does not have option to run alongside of windows, i have 444780 MB of shrink space Windows says i can shrink the space. Should i use their option or is that too risky also will this change allow me to run ubuntu alongside of windows? \n\nA: Use the shrink option. It works fine. Leave space for windows, too. It will need it for updates. Then, use the disk to install Ubuntu in the free space. You can also create an extended partition with a linux primary partition and swap primary partition inside it. Then create an ext3 file system. Then install Ubuntu. That shrink space is about 400 GB. You need about 20 GB for Ubuntu. You can probably get away with 100 GB of shrink space.

One has been happening for years through multiple versions of Ubuntu (at least from 11.10 to 12.04), the other is new since I update the kernel.\nFirst problem first, this is the one that's been happening for years.  During a normal boot the system will appear to hang on the \"purple\" screen, but really it's just at an initramfs prompt behind the purple screen.  I usually type \"exit\" and the boot continues as planned, loading into Ubuntu within a second or two.  I've always had the suspicion that this hang was due to my novice setup of a RAID array a couple years ago.  Something went wrong, I deleted the array and started over and the second time everything was fine.  But, that's about the time that this problem started happening.  I've lived with it because I only reboot my computer a couple times a year.  I can live with typing \"exit\" a couple times a year...\nSecond problem, I updated to the latest Kernel (something I hate doing because it ALWAYS gives me trouble, but the tinkerer in me insists that I get the latest updates...) and now after the first error I type exit and then the system hangs showing numerous warnings none of which I feel have anything to do with the actual problem because none of them are about mounting /dev/md/1 (even though it started as /dev/md1 when I created it the array is now known as /dev/md/1).  If I change my /etc/fstab to comment out the line about mounting /dev/md/1 everything will start up OK.\nOnce Ubuntu loads up I have to stop /dev/md1 (that is not a typo) and then mdadm --assemble --scan will properly start /dev/md/1.  I then edit my /etc/fstab so that /dev/md/1 is a device to mount and then run mount -a\nNowhere can I find why /dev/md1 is starting but /dev/md/1 is not.\nI don't know how to find the logs for previous boots or else I would put the warnings that I'm seeing during boot...  \nIn order to boot into Ubuntu OK I go to a recovery shell remount the filesystem as read/write, edit /etc/fstab to remove the /dev/md/1 mount and then continue with the boot.\n\nA: https://superuser.com/questions/454864/mdadm-ubuntu-12-04-fails-to-assemble-raid6-during-boot\nThat link gave me the answer I needed.

From what I've read it looks like maybe this is due to usermod expecting the password given to be encrypted?\nHow can I get back in?\n\nA: Yes, this problem happened because usermod -p expected the password hash (i.e., the encrypted password), not the cleartext password.\nFrom man 8 usermod:\n\n-p, --password PASSWORD\nThe encrypted password, as returned by crypt.\nNote: This option is not recommended because the password (or\n  encrypted password) will be visible by users listing the processes.\nThe password will be written in the local\n  /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow\n  file. This might differ from the password database configured in your\n  PAM configuration.\nYou should make sure the password respects the system's password\n  policy.\n\nYou can get back in the same way you would if you lost the administrator password under any other conditions.\nIf you have an administrator account, and it's not the account you specified as <username>, you can get it back by changing the password in the usual way:\nsudo passwd <username>\n\n\nA: From man usermod:\n   -p, --password PASSWORD\n       The encrypted password, as returned by crypt(3).\n\n       Note: This option is not recommended because the password (or encrypted password) will be visible by users listing the processes.\n\n       The password will be written in the local /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow file. This might differ from the password database configured\n       in your PAM configuration.\n\n       You should make sure the password respects the system's password policy.\n\nwhich basically means that the -p option needs a pre-encrypted password hash, not the actual value you're typing when logging in. This is a rarely-used option.\nThe recommended way to change your password from command line is to use passwd command.\nTo fix things, now you need to boot into recovery mode, log in as root and change your password using passwd username\n\nA: If you have root permissions you can enter\nsudo passwd loginname\n\nThe command will change the password of this specific user. After that you are able to log in again.\n", "Q: In XBMC, \"OK\", \"Vol +/-\" and \"Back\" buttons not working I have an Asus S1-AT5NM10E HTPC which has an integrated IR receiver. On Ubuntu 12.04, I have installed XBMC, but when I press \"OK\", \"Vol +/-\" or \"Back\" on my MCE remote (in fact, a Logitech Harmony 300i configured to emulate an MCE remote), XBMC doesn't seem to detect the signals. However, arrow buttons do work well.\nI know that the faulty buttons are detected by the computer because, when I run cat /dev/lirc0, a bunch of weird characters are displayed each time I press one of them. The IR receiver is also able to detect a completely different remote (TV) because another family of characters were displayed.\nI have installed lirc (sudo apt-get install lirc) to see the output of irw. Unfortunately, irw didn't output anything.\nThanks to ir-keytable, I could determinate the integrated IR receiver is from Nuvoton:\n$ ir-keytable \nFound /sys/class/rc/rc0/ (/dev/input/event4) with:\n        Driver nuvoton-cir, table rc-rc6-mce\n        Supported protocols: NEC RC-5 RC-6 JVC SONY LIRC other \n        Enabled protocols: LIRC \n        Extra capabilities: <access denied>\n\nWhy are some buttons not working?

How do i remove it I tried to compile and install manually a new version of compat wireless on my ubuntu 12.10, because i had a bit wifi problems. The problems aren't gone but now my internal wifi card (atheros ar9485) doesen't show (tried modprobe ath9k, no success), and i want to get back to like things was before. Used checkinstall and have tried dpkg -r compat-wireless but when i reeboot after the uninstall then i get no visible  wifi connections (i have an usb dongle which uses rt2800 driver too which doesent show).\n\nA: This problem sometimes happens because installing the new package replaces an old (or otherwise different) version, and uninstalling the new one leaves you without either.\nPerhaps a previous version of compat-wireless was installed before you installed with checkinstall. If so, you should reinstall that.  You can check whether or not this was the case by looking at /var/log/dpkg.log.\n", "Q: To convert a Windows machine to Ubuntu, can I just boot the CD and install? Rather than reinstall Windows I thought I would use my older machine to come up to speed on Ubuntu and dedicate the machine to that.\nI have another Windows machine operating do I just download Ubuntu, save and burn to a CD and install from that on to the machine which has lost the ability to boot currently?\n\nA: A working Windows system is only required to run Ubuntu if you install Ubuntu inside Windows using Wubi. (Even then, the Windows system can be pretty badly broken without affecting the Ubuntu system at all.)\nSo yes, all you have to do is to download an Ubuntu ISO image on another machine, burn it to CD/DVD or write it to a USB flash drive, and then boot from the CD/DVD/USB on the machine where you want to install.\nHowever, if there are files on the old computer you want to recover, it's advisable to do that first. Typically, the Ubuntu installer will give you the option to install alongside existing systems, which resizes their partitions while keeping the data intact. There is always a small (but significant) risk of data loss during dynamic partition resizing, though. The risk is probably increased in this scenario as there's a chance that what's wrong with the Windows system is related to filesystem corruption (which could contribute to a situation where dynamic partition resizing fails and is unable to fully recover the old state).\nPerhaps more importantly, you probably do not want to keep the old Windows XP system. Unless you plan to attempt fixing it, it does you no good. So you'll probably want to tell the Ubuntu installer to install over the existing operating system instead of alongside it. This will get rid of the XP system and all files in it, so if there are any documents or other important files in it, you should offload them first.\nConveniently, you can do this from the Ubuntu install CD. Boot the live CD/DVD/USB flash drive and select Try Ubuntu instead of Install Ubuntu. Open a folder window and find your Windows partition under Devices. Click it to mount it. Now you can browse and view your files there, and offload anything important.\nYou cannot copy the files to the desktop on the live CD/DVD/USB, as that's just stored in memory--when the machine shuts down or reboots, everything there goes away. Instead, depending on their size and the resource available to you, you can put them on an external hard drive or USB flash drive (other than the one you're using for installing), email them to yourself, use an Internet file storage service like DropBox or Ubuntu One, transfer them to your other Windows machine over the network (Ubuntu supports sharing files with Windows systems), or burn them to a CD/DVD.\nOnce you've offloaded any files you wish to keep, just double-click on Install Ubuntu on the desktop, and tell the installer to install over existing operating systems (not alongside them).\nSpecifically, the option to select is to install to the entire disk.\n\nA: First, keep Windows in case you need it. Then shrink the windows partition and leave at least 20 GB for Ubuntu as free space (not partitioned). Now, restart the computer and boot from the cd/dvd by bringing up the boot menu before windows starts (you have to press a key that the bios tells you in the first screen you see when you boot). Now, choose try it without changes option. If it boots up and works, then install it. At install, choose to install in the free space. Alternatively, You can take your free space and partition it as extended, partition and label a linux partition inside it, and use mkfs.ext3 to create an ext3 file system. Then create swap with the remaining portion of the extended partition.\n", "Q: libglib2.0-0 broken I accidentally broke libbglib2.0-0 by trying to install a newer Debian package version.

Loss of any disk with raid0 results in loss of the entire array.

Can I upgrade this distribution to precise LTS, then from there, convert to non-LTS releases?\n\nA: As an add-on. Once you have changed the upgrade target to normal, you can run \nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nto prompt the upgrade manager into action.\n\nA: \nconvert to non-LTS releases?\n\nThere's no such thing as converting in this context.\nThe only thing that you want to change here is the awareness level of new releases. One can set this to \"supported\" (regular) releases, \"long term only\" (LTS) releases, or even \"nothing\" (no major upgrades).\nThe GUI way of setting this op is mentioned in the answer of Im'juz ChanYun, but for command line, this is changing this file: /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades:\n# Default behavior for the release upgrader.\n\n[DEFAULT]\n# Default prompting behavior, valid options:\n#\n#  never  - Never check for a new release.\n#  normal - Check to see if a new release is available.  If more than one new\n#           release is found, the release upgrader will attempt to upgrade to\n#           the release that immediately succeeds the currently-running\n#           release.\n#  lts    - Check to see if a new LTS release is available.  The upgrader\n#           will attempt to upgrade to the first LTS release available after\n#           the currently-running one.  Note that this option should not be\n#           used if the currently-running release is not itself an LTS\n#           release, since in that case the upgrader won't be able to\n#           determine if a newer release is available.\nprompt=lts\n\nOnce you set this to prompt=normal you'll be notified (and allowed in a regular way) to upgrade to a regular release. Do this only after you've upgraded to 12.04 directly, as it's the fastest upgrade path. You really want to avoid the path in the first line here:\n10.04 -> 10.10 -> 11.04 -> 11.10 -> 12.04 -> 12.10 (if you would select normal now)\n10.04 ----------------------------> 12.04 -> 12.10 (if you select normal after 12.04)\n\n\nA: There is a setting in update manager (or software updater) to notify you about new versions. You can select only LTS (once in two years) or for any new versions (the twice a year version).\n\nA: Yes, you should be able to upgrade it straight to 12.04, and then to 12.10 if you wish.

If I set the router as default DNS on my pc, it would use DynDNS as the DNS. Then what if I set Google Public DNS as DNS on my pc, and DynDNS on my router, which DNS will it use?\n\nA: Your all-in-one-router (effectively also DNS+DHCP+Switch, etc.) is just a 'relay' device in this. It needs another DNS server to relay your DNS queries to and this is called a recursive lookup. PCs can 'ask' these DNS queries either to your router, or they can talk to another one on the internet directly if you want to, e.g. 8.8.8.8 (one of Google's Public DNS service). It will then just bypass the router in DNS queries. \nThe router might see the queries passing, but unless it intercepts it, it will just happily pass that as all other traffic you send into the world via it.\n\nA: Network Manager settingsfor your network would actually determine how would a computer resolves domains. Open the Network Connections editor (you can do that either through Network Manager indicator -> Edit Connections or typing in terminal nm-connection-editor  ). Select your network name, click Edit button, and go to IPv4 Settings tab. \n\nNow, take a look at the Method drop-down menu. There's two options of particular interest Automatic (DHCP) and Automatic (DHCP) addresses only. Automatic (DHCP) would use router's DNS. If you had specified another DNS server, like in the image above, your computer would use router's DNS as well as the one you specified. Which one would be used then ? The closest, your routers. If that one couldn't resolve - the second DNS server is asked to resolve. Try using these settings, and you will see the output of nm-tool | tail tell you two DNS addresses, just like here\n\nWhat would happen if you used Automatic (DHCP) address only ?  As the name suggests, suggests , your machine would only receive an IP address from the router, but use DNS that you specified. And again, we can verify that with nm-tool\n\nHow do you know it works ?  You could always test with websites that your internet service provider blocks ( if you know of such, of course ). Or you could also use dig command , which is a domain information look-up\n\nAs you can see in the image above, on line 13 it confirms that with Automatic (DHCP) address only setting, my machine sends requests to the DNS server I specified, which in this case, 208.67.220.220, is OpenDNS\nNote: when you make changes to your desired network, remember disconnect and reconnect or restart network manager for changes to take effect\n", "Q: is OpenJDK Vulnerable to 0-Day Exploit? I was curious to know if OpenJDK is also vulnerable to the Zero-Day Exploit that is currently afflicting Java 7 because of which experts are telling people to disable Java until a solution is found on all operating systems.\n\nA: update: see Ubuntu Security Notice USN-1693-1\n\nIt was discovered that OpenJDK 7's security mechanism could be bypassed via\n  Java applets. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, a\n  remote attacker could exploit this to perform arbitrary code execution as\n  the user invoking the program.\n\n\nProbably not for the specific exploit being used in the wild for Oracle's Java 7 plugin. These exploits are usually specifically crafted to run with a specific set of software.\nHowever, OpenJDK can be vulnerable in a similar way, if it's because of a design/architecture error in the way Java works in a browser. I could not find any details on it (at the time of writing) to support that statement with facts, but previous vulnerabilities were specifically for Oracle's JRE/JDK while OpenJDK has its own.\nPlease note the difference between an exploit and a vulnerability in this context.\nAlso note that you are probably affected to some extent if you're running Oracle's JRE/JDK on Ubuntu. However, the exploits are probably targeted for Windows hosts, and Oracle's JRE/JDK is no longer distributed by Ubuntu, due to licensing issues (Oracle doesn't allow redistribution anymore).\n\nA: I wouldnt take it lightly. OpenJDK shares most code with Oracle Java. Most apps written in Java work on both implementations. Naturally, the malware is just another application. If the vulnerability is a common one, you might get a surprise.\nNow, it might be trickier to crack open (I mean root) Linux than Windows (and probably not worth the effort of researching  and trying to defeat all possible Linux variants' security models, patches and so on) - but, they can work in the userspace stealing data or even deleting it or something. If the application is launched succesfully with even the current users rights, it might reach any data that is available to the user for reading. I dont think its that complicated to implement a cross platform data miner.\nI suppose your passwords stored in the browser (not to talk about other personal data like pictures) might get some Russian bot herders happy.\nSo. Caution. This might happen to you regardless of the OS you use. The simplest solution is to enable click to play (all major browsers support it) and not being click-happy.\nAlthough Java plugins (do not mistake it for Java script, that is NOT Java) arent that widespread nowadays, i personally have the plugin disabled for ages and never needed it.\n", "Q: Installing MS office in Ubuntu without CD-ROM I wanted to install MS Office in Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS.

In this case, how can I install it? Anyone knows?\n\nA: I've had that problem once too.\nIf you have an .exe file\nIt all depends on the type of setup file you have. Microsoft allows both .exe files as downloads and .iso files. If you have an .exe file you can just follow standard installation instructions using PlayOnLinux or just click or right-click on the file and use wine to process the install.\nIf you have an .iso file\nBurn a CD\nIf you have an .iso file, there are a few easy solutions.

Then you can install from the CD (again using PlayOnLinux).\n\nOr mount the .iso file\nThe other option is to mount the .iso file directly. You can do so as follows:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/iso\nsudo mount -o loop the-path-to-your-iso-file.iso /mnt/iso\n\nOnce the .iso file is mounted it is possible to install office using PlayOnLinux and use the /mnt/iso directory as if it were a CD.\nIn that case you need to select your directory in this dialogue box: \n\nAfter the install you can sudo umount /mnt/iso.\nThe last screenshot comes from http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/easily-install-microsoft-office-2007-linux/ which also provides a nice HOWTO for installing Office 2007 using PlayOnLinux.\n\nA: Since Microsoft sells Microsoft office for money you won't be able to install it for free.  You will probably need to get a Microsoft office Installation disk to install the program.  Or if you have a purchased copy of Microsoft office try running the installer with wine program loader.\n\nA: you can do an .iso and mount it into a virtual drive... more on this link \nhttp://www.liberiangeek.net/2012/12/create-virtual-cd-dvd-drives-in-ubuntu-12-10-with-cdemu/\n", "Q: Are we affected by the JAVA vulnerability?

Back then, Ubuntu not even recognized that hardware as integrated to the computer. I purchased a cheap USB wireless network adapter that has worked excellent on Ubuntu; it has the form of a USB pendrive, and I connect it through an extension wire (I read that for health purposes is better to place it 15 cm. far to your body). \nThe name of the adapter is \"Realtek RTL8187B WLAN Adapter\". --it works pretty good in Ubuntu by just conecting it to USB port. \nIf you buy an adapter, I recomend you to take your laptop to the store and ask to try the adapter right there before buying it.\nToday I have upgraded to Ubuntu Precise Pangolin LTS and now the atheros works..., but with that same problems you mentioned.

Think of it as for each socket in the motherboard there is one physical id.\nNext we have the core ids that reference that physical id. If you look at it, It repeats itself. This is because of the Hyper Threading. There are actually 4 cores and 4 HT ones. So in the end it shows for that one physical id, 4 core ids and 4 HT.\nIf you have more sockets in your motherboard, the amount of physical IDs will go up along with the amount of cores. In your case it is suppose to show 8 cores (In my case it is 4 cores) so it will show a long list but since it is repeating itself after the 4th core, it looks like is either not reading the other cores (BIOS issue, Kernel issue) or the cpuinfo is not detecting it correctly.\nIt would also help to find out why if you could execute the following:\nsudo dmidecode -t processor | grep -e Core -e Thread and add the information to your question.

This might be do to how cpuinfo shows this for AMD or that specific family model. If commands like lscpu, dmidecode can show you the amount of CPUs, Cores and threads/siblings for each, then the issue is with how cpuinfo handles the information.\n", "Q: Latest two images will not install on Nexus7 (32GB + 3G), but older were Ok The latest two (newest) daily images will not install on my Nexus 7, 32GB + 3G. The older versions work fine. Background looks like coloured snow. (I can not post the screenshot.) \nThere is no on-screen keyboard visible. So I can not enter anything [like user] name, password ..\n\nA: You installed from at least two daily-live images before. They were both successful.\nThen you tried the most recent two daily-lives when they came out, and they failed. You've gone the extra mile and verified that it fails by attempting to reinstall with it several more times. It's continued to fail at the same point and in the same way as before.\nYou should file your bug report now.\nYou don't have to go back again and make sure it still works the way it used to work. It's a daily-live. It's expected to work, fail, and (with hope, eventually) work again, from one day to the next.\nSome Guidelines for Hard-to-Report Bugs in Daily Builds\nIf you haven't done so already, make sure to read this thoroughly. For good general information (not specific to Ubuntu) for reporting bugs, take a look here. It may be a good idea to be familiar with this and this too.\nWhich package you'll report the bug against, and what kind of technical information you should try to collect, will be determined by how the error occurs and what it looks like.\nThis is less of a flowchart and more of an explanation of basic bug troubleshooting and reporting for alpha/beta releases, starting with the chronologically earliest (after booting) and hardest to report bugs, and building up to the later and often more easily filed bugs.\n\nYou will need a keyboard in order to do some of this, but if you're unable to provide as much information in your bug reports as a\nconsequence, you should still report bugs as you find them.\nI have written this to address the general case of your situation\n(with the hope that it will help others too in a variety of\ndaily-live testing scenarios); don't worry when some of this doesn't apply to you.\nHowever, you may want to attempt to install a Bluetooth keyboard so that you can perform a wider range of troubleshooting methods.\nDepending on where the bug happens, this might or might not be\npractical. If you want to attempt that, these resources may help.\nAlso, please note that a laptop with Bluetooth can be used as a\nBluetooth keyboard for your tablet.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you never get as far as the GUI loading, and the Plymouth splash screen (with Ubuntu and the colored dots) doesn't even come up, try booting with nomodeset. Whether or not that succeeds, report the bug against the package linux.\nIf it succeeds, that's important information, plus it lets you report the bug better by starting with ubuntu-bug linux or, if you only have a command-line, apport-cli linux. For more information, see man ubuntu-bug and man apport-cli.\n\n\n*If the GUI never loads but you get a virtual console, or you are able to get one by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 or Ctrl+Alt+F2, then report the bug against xserver-xorg (unless you suspect it's a particular video driver and know or can find the name of the package that provides it). Use apport-cli if possible.\nMake sure /var/log/Xorg.0.log gets attached to the bug report. On a live system, especially one that fails early such that you cannot get the GUI up and working again, there will usually be no Xorg.0.log.old in /var/log, but if there is one, make sure it gets attached too.\nAlso make sure /home/ubuntu/.xsession-errors and /home/ubuntu/.xsession-errors.old are attached, if they exist. If the problem happens early, it's likely neither will exist.\nIf you can get a virtual console at any point, and you can connect to the Internet, it's not too hard to file bugs with excellent technical information included.\nYou can use apport-cli, and you can transfer any additional files you need to attach to the bug report to another machine (as you might find Launchpad cumbersome to use with a text-based web browser like links2).\nIt's usually hard to connect a machine to the Internet via wireless without a GUI (most wireless users have GUI's so it's sort of a niche thing and there hasn't been a command-line client for the Network Manager for several releases now). So if possible, the easiest way to connect to the Internet may be via Ethernet (if you have the necessary hardware, including an Ethernet card in your computer). Of course, if you're testing on a virtual machine, connecting it to the Internet should be no problem.\nIf you have another machine (or this is a virtual machine), sometimes it's quite useful to install an SSH server so you can connect to it from outside. This makes copying and pasting text from the terminal easy, and for that reason I almost always do this when I have to use apport-cli.\nYou can also run graphical programs on the testing system and have their interfaces appear on the SSH client (this works even if the GUI on the testing system has problems and even if the X server does not start at all). This can be very handy--you can run ubuntu-bug graphically, for example. (You can also run the ubiquity installer even when the GUI isn't working on the the machine...but when the GUI isn't working, your energy as a tester would usually be better devoted to investigating and bugreporting that.)\n\n\n*If the desktop loads but you cannot select between Try Ubuntu and Install Ubuntu, see if the text-based boot menu works to let you choose one. Press Spacebar (or any key) as the keyboard and person icons appear near the bottom of the screen (this is around when the DVD/USB is first starting to boot). This should make the text-based boot menu appear. You can select the option you want with the arrow keys and press Enter.\nIf selecting between trying and installing Ubuntu is just broken on the graphical screen, it's likely you've found a bug in the ubiquity-dm executable, which is provided by ubiquity, the same package that provides Ubiquity, the graphical installer. In this case, the best thing to do would be to produce the bug, then go to a virtual console, use pidof or pgrep, or ps piped to grep (ps ax | grep ubiquity-dm) to get the PID for ubiquity-dm, then run apport-cli PID (replacing PID with the actual number of course).\n\n\n*If you can select between Try Ubuntu and Install Ubuntu but one of them doesn't work, that's important information. Try again and pick the other one.\n\n*\n\n*If Try Ubuntu works and you get a fully functional desktop, try running the installer. It will likely (though not necessarily) not work. Then you can report a bug against it. (You have a fully working desktop environment, after all.) Sometimes additional information about what goes wrong can be obtained by running Ubiquity from a terminal window. To do this, press Ctrl+Alt+T. For Ubuntu, run ubiquity gtk_ui; for Kubuntu, ubiquity kde-ui. The --debug/-d flag is sometimes useful but read the manpage first so you understand where it's putting the verbose debugging output, and remember it causes just about everything to be logged including any passwords you enter during installation!\n\n*If Install Ubuntu works, the installer runs. Normally, it's possible to cancel the installer, which drops the user to a fully functional desktop. See if that works.\n\nWhatever doesn't work, you can bugreport (which is the most important thing). Whatever does work, you can test (and bugreport anything about it that turns out not to work, or not to work right). In all your bug reports, make sure to report exactly what you were trying to cause to happen, what you did, and what did happen.\n\n\n*If you're in the installer, or another application, and the GUI stops working (to such an extent that you cannot continue running graphical applications on the machine), see if it's reliably triggered by the same event. If it is, cool! That should definitely be reported as a bug. (If it just happens from time to time, that should still be reported as a bug.)\nGo to a virtual console and see if it's due to a crash. One easy way to do this is to check if there is a .crash file in /var/crash. If there is not, then either Apport crash reporting is disabled (which has sometimes been the case for early alphas, you can run cat /etc/default/apport, if enabled=1 it's enabled).\nIf there is a crash file, run apport-cli on it to report the crash. If the problem wasn't a crash, report it against xserver-xorg (unless there's another package you suspect is the cause), using apport-cli xserver-xorg if you can.\n\n\n*If the GUI stops responding but still looks OK, that might be triggered by an application (such as Ubiquity) freezing in such a way that it monopolizes the X server and prevents new input from given.\nIf someone can explain better how and why that happens, an edit would be most welcome!\nI'm not sure if it's better to report that against the app that triggered it or against the X server, but I think probably the app, as something went wrong there first.\nIn any case the first thing to do is see if this is the case, by quitting the application. You can use the same process utilities explained in part 3 above to figure out the PID (or PID's, some applications, including Ubiquity, have more than one associated process) of the application you suspect is the trigger. Then you can attempt to terminate them with kill, killall, or pkill. For example, to terminate a process whose PID is 4000, run kill 4000. If that doesn't do the trick (you can use ps or similar utilities again to see), try kill -KILL 4000 (which sends SIGKILL instead of SIGTERM). If you get a Permission denied or similar error, try running it as root--that is, sudo kill 4000 or sudo kill -KILL 4000.\nAfter you've killed the application successfully, go back to the GUI (Alt+F7) and see if it's responding again. If so, that reasonably well confirms that the application whose process(es) you just killed were responsible for, or at least involved in, the problem.\nOnce you've verified that this is what's happening, reproduce the freeze, then switch to a virtual console and report the bug with apport-cli PID.\n\n\n*If a problem occurs that doesn't keep the GUI from working right, great! Finding bugs is the main purpose of testing, and finding bugs that don't make their own reporting difficult is the best scenario.\n\n*\n\n*If it's a crash, let Apport collect and send the stack trace and other important technical information, then fill out the report.\n\n*If it's any other kind of bug, use ubuntu-bug whenever possible as some valuable information is still sent. Generally, if it's a bug that's showing itself in the way an application is running--especially if the application is not responding--it's especially valuable to invoke ubuntu-bug with the PID of the application. Or, since your GUI is working, you can run ubuntu-bug -w and click on the ailing application window.\n\n\n\nHere are some general considerations to keep in mind, no matter when your bug occurs, what it looks like, and what information you're able to discover about it:\n\n*\n\n*When you report a bug that isn't a crash, what package it's in is often a guess. It's best to make it as educated as possible a guess, but sometimes the bug has to be seriously investigated before anyone can know. Furthermore, there's no way for me to give a thorough explanation of how always to figure out what package is affected (mainly because I often don't know how, but also because there are many considerations; a full treatment of the subject might be an entire book).\nThe package for a bug can be changed after the bug is reported, so you shouldn't let not knowing what package a bug affects keep you from reporting it for too long.\nIt's also possible to have a bug filed against more than one package at a time. After you submit a bug report on Launchpad, you can add additional packages. You can also add upstream projects (typically those corresponding to the affected package or packages in Ubuntu against which the bug was first reported), and packages in other distributions (but you should generally only add them if you know the bug occurs there, and there is a bug report on the other distribution's bug tracker).\n\n\n*Search first before submitting a bug report, especially if it's not a crash bug. (The materials linked to near the top of this answer explain how to do this properly.)\n\n\n*Your bug report should be clear, and as detailed as you can reasonably be. Bugs in daily-lives should indicate the date of the daily-live if possible. If you know what daily-live appears to have introduced the bug, definitely include that information!\nObtaining a Particular Daily Build\nUsually, you want to use the latest daily-live. See if there's a newer one here than what you already have. It's virtually always best to test with the latest daily-live.\n(Or the latest daily-preinstalled, if that's what you're testing...though that's largely outside the scope of this answer.)\nIf a bug appears to arise with a particular daily build, it's often unnecessary to test again with a previous one. This is especially true for bugs that always happen (which appears to be the case in the example scenario you have). For random crashes, on the other hand, it might be worthwhile to go back to a recent previous daily-live to see if you can produce them. However, typically this should only be done if (a) it's reasonably quick and easy for you to accomplish, or (b) something is known about the bug that indicates it's especially important to figure out exactly when it started.\nUsually, it's sufficient to go back one daily-live. The server always stores two. (On rare occasion there's more than one daily-live in a day, and then the server will sometimes have three at a time, but still not spanning more than two days.)\nIf you feel you really do need (or want) an even earlier daily-live than what's on cdimage.ubuntu.com, I don't think old daily-lives are officially retained for distribution, but it's sometimes possible to get a three-day old (or perhaps occasionally even older) daily-live from a mirror that is not yet fully up to date.\nYou can search the web for this, with ubuntu, the string of digits representing the date of the daily live you want, and \"daily live\". For example, to get the daily live you were looking for in your question, I searched Google for:\nubuntu \"daily live\" 20130110\n\nUsually, most of the results will be from cdimage.ubuntu.com itself. Since you've checked that the daily-live you want isn't still there, you can disregard these. It's just cached data (and Google does not cache the ISO's themselves).\nWhen you find a server other than cdimage, check it out. I found this:\n\n*\n\n*ftp://ftp.tu-chemnitz.de/pub/linux/ubuntu-cdimage/_LASTMIRROR.txt\n(I am providing this for illustrative purposes; anyone reading this more than a day or two after I post it shouldn't expect any significant likelihood of this server still carrying that particular daily-live. But that doesn't matter. This to show how to do it for an arbitrary daily-live.)\nThat's actually a log showing what files the mirror downloaded from the central server. The key is to navigate up the directory tree. So, I went up to ftp://ftp.tu-chemnitz.de/pub/linux/ubuntu-cdimage/.\nThere I found a daily-live directory containing the daily-lives shown in the log Google had found for me. One of those files was the daily-live I was looking for, 20130110.\nOften an FTP site will have a web server also, so it's worth trying to replace ftp:// with http:// in the URL. (The rest is usually the same, even if it starts like ftp..) Sometimes the HTTP server will be faster, and sometimes the FTP server will be the fastest. Mirrors that update slower might be slower to download from, too, so the difference in speed could matter. Generally both the FTP and HTTP versions of a site will be updated at the same time (or almost exactly the same time) as typically they serve the same files from the same server, though this isn't universally the case.\nIf you have a later daily-live, you can \"update\" to an older one withzsync, just as you'd update from an older one to a newer one. zsync is packaged for Ubuntu, and is available for other OSes as well. If you want to use is on Windows, there's information in this answer about how to do that. zsync requires HTTP to work; it will not download a file via FTP. (It will of course download a file via HTTP where the domain name starts with ftp., though.)\nIf you need this particular old daily-live and you're not able to grab it in time, please comment to let me know. I might be able to come up with something else.\n", "Q: How to get thumbnails for Hi10p videos?

I changed the permissions of /var/ folder to 777 and I think this causes the error. Please help me get back a functional sudo and /var.\n\nA: You have a really big problem, but not really for the reasons stated here.\nChanging the permissions on all of /var will make it likely you will not get them all back correctly, because you will not know what permissions every file should have. You may have problems later. Depending on the circumstances, your problems might be security-related.\nTherefore, you may wish to consider reinstalling Ubuntu. Alternatively, you can try to get the permissions from the files in another, similar, unbroken system. The permissions are usually the same. Usually. A more serious problem is that it's likely your system has some files in /var that are not present on the other one, so probably not all the permissions will be fixed.\nPerforming administrative tasks on a desktop system without a working sudo is usually trivially easy, though.\nChanging the permissions back when you know what they should be is easy, and rarely requires booting into recovery mode or from a live CD. This is because, while it's not widely known, desktop versions of Ubuntu (and most other GNU/Linux operating systems these days) have two ways set up to perform administrative tasks:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo, which will not work because it requires the permissions in /var to be correct.\n\n*PolicyKit, which tends to be more tolerant of wrong permissions and usually still works.\n\n\nWhile we tend to think of sudo as the way you perform actions as root on Ubuntu, actually PolicyKit is the way most, though not all, graphical utilities become root. (It has been this way for some years now.)\nActually, running a graphical program manually with PolicyKit is sometimes a significant undertaking as graphical applications must have special configuration files for PolicyKit to be willing to run them. But terminal applications don't -- it's just as easy to run a text-based command with PolicyKit as with sudo.\nTo do it, type pkexec where you'd otherwise type sudo. (They don't take all the same command-line options, but the most common syntax for sudo is sudo command, and pkexec works perfectly in its place.)\nSo, because sudo is broken, you cannot run:\nsudo chmod 0755 /mnt/var/lib/sudo\nsudo chmod 0700 /mnt/var/lib/sudo/<username>\n\nBut you can run:\npkexec chmod 0755 /mnt/var/lib/sudo\npkexec chmod 0700 /mnt/var/lib/sudo/<username>\n\nThat's a good start, and it will probably make sudo work again. (It's not going to fix all the other files in /var, though.)\nRelated (but, in most cases, not identical) situations where pkexec is helpful:\n‣ How to modify an invalid /etc/sudoers file? It throws an error and it's not allowing me to edit again to fix it\n‣ accidently blocked access to sudoers.d whilst trying to change ushare config\n‣ 'sudo' not working after changing the permissions of '/usr' directory\n‣ How to fix sudo after \"chmod -R 777 /usr/bin\"?, sudo error, is mode 0777, should be 0440,\n           How to repair \"sudo: /etc/sudoers is mode 0640, should be 0440?\"\n‣ Installing ZFS changed my sudoers file\n‣ Password not working for sudo (\"Authentication failure\")\n‣ Why does nothing work after I randomly changed some file permissions?\n‣ changed /etc permission in oneiric (ubuntu11.10) by using \"sudo chmod 665 /etc\" cant use sudo now\n‣ How do I run specific sudo commands without a password? (just if something goes wrong)\n‣ Can't write /etc/sudoers from Ubuntu live CD (just if something goes wrong)\n\nA: You have a really big problem in your hands.  First of all, in order to get you sudo working again, you will need to change the permissions of the /var/lib/sudo folder and the file navneet inside of it.\nBut, in order to do it, you will need root access.  If you happen to have changed the root password, then you will only need to su - and change the permissions as below:\n$ chmod 0755 /var/lib/sudo\n$ chmod 0700 /var/lib/sudo/navneet\n\nAnd you are good to go.  But, if you haven't changed your root password, you will need to obtain root access by other means. On a standard Ubuntu install you can do this by booting into recovery mode. This is done by rebooting and hitting the shift key after the BIOS screen disappears. It is advisable to hit it repeatedly, but slowly. If you succeed the GRUB Menu will  come up and you can chose the second option (marked recovery mode). From the next menu you should chose root shell. This will bring you to a root prompt. On 12.04 you will need to make the hard drive writable to make any changes. The command for this is mount -o,remount,rw /. It make take several attempts to bring the GRUB menu up.\nAlternatively you may use a boot CD.I suggest you to use the Gentoo minimal installation CD, as it is small in size and will get the job done, there are also several specialist recovery CD's available. A standard install CD will often  work if you choose to live boot rather than install.  Boot your computer through the CD, and mount your partition to /mnt/ (mount /dev/sda1 /mnt), for example.  Then you may change the permissions like this:\nchmod 0755 /mnt/var/lib/sudo\nchmod 0700 /mnt/var/lib/sudo/navneet\n\nIt is best to use this to backup your data and then do get a fresh install. Since other applications may stop working because of wrong permissions, and there could be other consequences that compromise the security of your machine.\n\nA: I had a similar error, but was still actually able to use sudo (It displayed the error message, and it did what I told it to do after that.), so I fixed it with:\nsudo chmod -R 0700 /var/lib/sudo\n\n(I was running Ubuntu 14.04)\n", "Q: python-problem-report python-apport apport break apt-get I can no longer install or upgrade packages with apt-get since the packages python-problem-report, python-apport and apport seem to cause some problems.

Never figured it out except that ls is a valid command. Using ls displays various (hdx , *) files/directories/drives.\nNote that, as I never got to load Windows 8 from GRUB despite various tutorials, I use rEFInd to switch between loading GRUB (which, in turn, I use to load Ubuntu) and Windows 8.\nHow do I re-enable GRUB (and get to Ubuntu) and does anyone know what just caused this problem? I remember installing Ubuntu updates last night but I can't remember if there was anything that might relate to something UEFI-specific.\n\nA: I haven't figured out an exact solution for this but I managed to get back to Ubuntu by a more \"general\" (for lack of a better term) solution.\nI was having a look around at my BIOS when I noticed an option to turn off Secure Boot (wonder why I never noticed it before when I was having trouble dual booting Win8 and Precise). I turned this off and voila, GRUB loads. What's more is that I can now load Windows 8 from GRUB; I no longer need rEFInd as an intermediary. Choosing Win8 from GRUB shows some error tho (which I can bypass with just a press of any key). I'll look into this some other time, unless I figure it's something really risky.\n\nA: As you've discovered, disabling Secure Boot fixes the problem. My hunch is that you either had it disabled before and somehow accidentally enabled it or you were using a Secure Boot-enabled version of GRUB before and a software update installed an unsigned GRUB or changed the boot path in a way that bypassed the shim program (which is what Ubuntu uses to support Secure Boot).\nAnother option is to add Secure Boot support more generally. If your first boot loader is rEFInd, you can read rEFInd's Secure Boot documentation for details of how to get it to work with Secure Boot. Unfortunately, Ubuntu doesn't yet ship with a MOK-enabled version of shim, so you'll need to install another version of shim and add Ubuntu's public key to your MOK list. This is possible, and it's not even all that hard, but it involves using several command-line tools and following instructions pretty precisely. Note that Ubuntu added Secure Boot support with version 12.10. I noticed a 12.04 tag on your question, so if you're using 12.04, your kernels are almost certainly not signed, which will complicate this fuller use of Secure Boot. Overall, it's probably best to leave Secure Boot disabled; I mention this alternative in case you have reason to enable it.\n\nA: the problem you are facing could be due to the fact of some mandatory (arm) based and not so mandatory (intel) processors bearing the windows 8 logo.. Which in majority is secure boot, which \"With Secure Boot active, the firmware checks for the presence of a cryptographic signature on any EFI program that it executes\". To get around this, you most likely will need to disable secure boot.  Take a look into this article for some history and what you need to know to get the  job done:\nhttp://www.rodsbooks.com/efi-bootloaders/secureboot.html\n\nA: As discussed in another thread, this is due to your grub image not being installed with --uefi-secure-boot parameter (you can find one already made here). \nOf course you'll have to whitelist it again in UEFI. \n", "Q: Glitching and delayed output when recording PulseAudio loopback I try to make a screencast where I need to record both microphone and pc output sound (and video of course) . \nI tried to make a loopback in pulseaudio to \"merge\" them and using this sink with the recording tool (first i tried recordmydesktop then ffmpeg/avconv).\nBut the issue is when I use this loopback , the sound is glitching (I think this is the better word describing it) and have progressive delay (meaning a lot lot delay after 2/3 minutes).

I used to use an 8GB card for storage with no problems, but recently upgraded to a 32GB card. When I insert the card, nothing happens. It is not automatically mounted like the 8GB one was. When I type in sudo fdisk -l, the information for /dev/sda appears immediately, but the computer then pauses several minutes before giving the information about /dev/sdb (which is the SD card slot). \nI have to manually mount the card via sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/SIGMA. This takes even longer than fdisk; up to ten minutes. The drive is then mounted and accessible, but does not appear in the Places section of the Lubuntu file manager. \nI don't know very much about diagnostics. Is there any way to tell whether the new SD card is damaged? Alternatively, can you suggest how to work out what is going wrong and how to fix it?\nEDIT: Should point out that the SD card mounted with no problems on Windows 7.\nEDIT2: The output from sudo blkid was:\n/dev/sdb1: LABEL=\"SIGMA\" UUID=\"148ACD4F8ACD2E54\" TYPE=\"ntfs\" \n\nEDIT3: \nSee my comment to fabricator4's answer below.  I added the SD card to the fstab file with the following line. The card now mounts automatically on boot, however it still takes a very long time for this to mount, which means booting the computer now takes several minutes longer than it used to.

It's working great.  I did delete the partition table and remade it with gparted as I've seen problems with Verbatim partition tables on SD cards and USB sticks.\nHave a look at the this question and my my answer for possible reasons for the problem and the solution.\nIn particular you might try this test from that that answer to verify the problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Running fdisk -l on the thumbdrive will often declare that it has no partition table, even though you know there is one and can write data to it if it is still mounting OK.\n\n\nIf you have a 900SD or similar I can recommend using the SD card to mount as /home, since the SSD is generally only 8GB - fine for Ubuntu but a bit tight if you store any work or data on it at all.\n\nA: if it is a hardware issue it should be mentioned in the log-files (Gnome Log File Viewer or the output of dmesg should do) just search for the vendor name or other device references (sdb1) and see if any errors or warnings are mentioned\nBut: I think its more likely to be a problem with ntfs.

I managed to install Ubuntu 12.10 with the option acpi=off, as it didn't work without.\nNow it boots only with this option. Is it possible to solve the problem for the need of this option? With this option it is booting is quite slow.\nCould it be related to the Nvidia GeForce GT 520M card I have with Optimus technology? Maybe its drivers?\nMy laptop is a one year old ASPIRE 5750G.\n\nA: Turning ACPI off on a mobile PC (laptop/notebook) is not a good idea - it disables all power management you really want on those devices.\nThe root cause is probably a 'broken' BIOS that presents a false, corrupt or confusing ACPI table to the kernel. It may have been noticed by others and a workaround could be available. Also, your laptop vendor may have fixed this.\nSome options I see you have from here (in your now somewhat vague but general situation):\n\n\n*\n\n*Note that the kernel in the image to install Ubuntu is older than what is now 'stable', as some updates have been made available after the release. First thing to try is to apply all system updates and temporarily remove the boot parameter. Boot into Grub holding Shift, select the right entry, press E, remove the acpi=off kernel parameter and boot with F10. Keep using this with all options below to try!\n\n*Try to boot with acpi_osi=Linux as kernel parameter.\n\n*Upgrade to a more recent kernel. See this answer on how to do that.\n\n*Try to see if your laptop vendor has a BIOS update available. Apply it if so.\n\n*Try to boot with just one graphics card. Disable the discrete/Nvidia one and try also with the integrated one disabled.\n\n*In case you have an Nvidia Optimus enabled machine (hybrid graphics, often found in laptops), try to install Bumblebee for proper support of this technique. You can find some instructions in this answer.\n\n*Try to see if you have OS/ACPI specific settings in your BIOS.\n\n*Google around using your device vendor/type combination together with the keyword 'Linux'. Another distribution may have fixed it, someone may have proposed it to the kernel developers, but it may not have been merged in the main kernel tree yet, etc.\n\n*Report it as a bug. How do I report a bug?\nOnce you've managed to fix the issue, remove the kernel parameter permanently by removing in from the file /etc/default/grub and running sudo update-grub. (And if your solution was to boot with another kernel boot paramater, just edit the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT setting accordingly in that file.)\nIf you have more specific information on that and need assistance, make it a new question, e.g. \"How do I apply this workaround for my HP Probook... ?\"\n\nA: The OP (Marce) found a solution. On 12/1/2012 the OP said:\n\nI finally solved the problem following the instructions given by Arttu\n  at the question\n  Desktop does not show when I installed nvidia drivers!.\n  The problem was about the nvidia drivers.\n\nThis is the answer to which the OP was referring.\nNormally we'd close this as a duplicate of that question, but gertvdijk's answer here is valuable and addresses this but not that.\n", "Q: Rearranging Indicators (Dropbox, Clementine and Recent Notifications) Here are my indicators on the top bar.\n\n{From left to right, first one is Free Rapid Downloader and second is Recent Notifications (jconti)}\nI have managed to reorder some of them using the file \n\n/usr/share/indicator-application/ordering-override.keyfile\n\n[Ordering Index Overrides]\nnm-applet=1\ngnome-power-manager=2\nibus=3\ngst-keyboard-xkb=4\ngsd-keyboard-xkb=5\nindicator-sensors=6\nindicator-cpufreq=7\njupiter-client=8\nclassicmenu-indicator=9\ncaffeine-cup-empty=10\nmultiload=12\n\nI would now like to place multiload on the complete left. \nI.E move Dropbox, Clementine and Recent Notifications(jconti) right\nI do not need to move Free Rapid Downloader and I've changed default icons of recent notifications.\nWhat are the names of the dropbox indicator, clementine indicator and recent notifications indicator to be used in the ordering-override.keyfile ?\n\nA: The names of the indicators can be found out with:\ndbus-send --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=com.canonical.indicator.application /com/canonical/indicator/application/service com.canonical.indicator.application.service.GetApplications | grep \"object path\"\n\nReplace underscores with hyphens in the keyfile.\nSource: http://www.acetous.de/179/ubuntu-12-04-finetuning\n", "Q: Installing ubuntu besides windows 8 I have been trying to install ubuntu (I tried 12.04LTS, 12.10, 12.10-secure-remix) using the wubi installer on Windows 8 and all the three times ran into the same problem showing some cannot find /ubuntu/winboot/wubildr when I tried to start ubuntu.\nI tried to change the boot settings from UEFI to Legacy and then my laptop restarted and showed that \"No operating System Found\".\nI then tried to install Ubuntu using a cd and after a lot of effort and using boot repair,etc. I landed into a new trouble. When I select UEFI on, the laptop loads Windows and windows too does not detect ubuntu. When I select Legacy mode, it starts ubuntu, shows me an option to start windows 8 but gives an error showing windows failed to load.\nSo in legacy mode, i am able to use only ubuntu and in UEFI mode, I am able to use only Win8. Please explain any process of starting windows in legacy mode (which I tried without any success) or starting ubuntu in UEFI mode.\n\nA: You have installed Ubuntu in Legacy mode, but you need it in UEFI mode as Windows is in UEFI mode.\nTo fix this:\n\n\n*\n\n*set up your BIOS in UEFI mode, and disable SecureBoot /FastBoot /QuickBoot\n\n*boot on your Ubuntu-Secure disc (in UEFI mode if possible), choose Try Ubuntu, run Boot-Repair's Recommended Repair\n\n*Reboot the PC. You should see the GRUB menu with access to both Ubuntu and Windows.\n\n\nA: Try to turn off \"Secure Boot\" in UEFI, then install Windows 8 first, then install Ubuntu, and agree to install GRUB. It should detect both Windows 8 and Ubuntu.\n\nA: If Windows 8 came pre-installed on your computer, it almost certainly boots in EFI mode. The last I heard, WUBI did not work with EFI-mode boots. Thus, any attempt to use WUBI with an EFI-booting Windows system is doomed to failure. You should switch tracks and do a standard (non-WUBI) Linux installation.\n", "Q: AMD catalyst driver 12.1 Kubuntu 12.10 (64 bit) I have an ASUS N56DP laptop and I have Kubutu 12.10 working on it with the default graphics drivers.

I had the same \"hang\" problem after installing the AMD Catalyst 12.10 drivers. I'm going to try and install the AMD Catalyst 12.11 beta driver when I get home. If you Google around, there are many people experiencing problems with AMD's Catalyst 12.10 driver on Linux.\nI'll report back here after I've performed the AMD Catalyst 12.11 beta install.\n\nA: When you switch to the Catalyst driver you have to add \"nomodeset\" to your kernel boot flags to turn off Kernel Mode Setting. The catalyst driver doesn't work with KMS.\nPS: I also have this N56DP. Suspend/Resume always crashes for me. Have you had any luck with it? Also, it always tries to suspend when you close the lid.

When I was installing several programs from the Ubuntu Software Center, I installed several of them in a row; for some, I was asked to provide my password; for others, I wasn't. When I removed them, the same programs that needed a password for installation, needed a password for removal; the others didn't. Why is that?\nI thought I needed to provide my password each time I make any changes. If not, doesn't my system become insecure? Many thanks!\n\nA: It's normal. I also noticed it. The reason is when you first want to install a software, it ask for password, and you give it. The software center will grant you to install some more software for a short time,  it does so to make the installation process for the user more friendly. But since it also is a concern of security,  after this short time is expired, you will again be asked for password.  \nSame is true for uninstallation process. Hope I you got the point \n\nA: It is beacuse when you provide password you have privileges until you shut down program (terminal, Ubuntu Software Center, etc.), or if you want after short amount of time.\n", "Q: 'no active partition found' error after install of Ubuntu 12.04?

There is no desktop environment installed. Is there a way I can clone my boot drive to a USB drive so that it can be restored at a later date if needed?\n\nA: Rsync is great utility to do backup and cloning. It is pre installed on Ubuntu. \nYou can take backup of live server either on local server or on remote server.   \nFor example\nrync <source> <destionation>\n\nfollowing command will backup my all Ubuntu root partition to my remote server (192.168.1.55).\nrsync root@kk:/  root@192.168.1.55:/backup_kk\n\nAnother Technique to clone server is take snapshot of root partition of server with Clonezilla, But it requires to reboot server.

I have a Dell inspiron 1525 and was wondering if I needed an ethernet cable to connect to the internet during installation of Ubuntu? Or is an ethernet cable required to connect for the first time after installation?\n\nA: This question is fairly vague, but in brief, the answer is \"no\" - the Ubuntu installer will allow you to pick a WIFI network for installation. Even then, a connection to the internet is only recommended, not required, to complete Ubuntu installation.\n\nA: Your family model, the Dell Inspiron 1525 all come with a wireless network card. They either have a:\n\n\n*\n\n*Broadcom 4312 Based Card\n\n*Dell Wireless 1397 802.11g Half Mini-Card (Based on Broadcom 4312)\n\n*Dell Wireless 1490 802.11a/g/n Full Mini-Card (Based on Broadcom 4311)\n\n*Intel Next-Gen 4965AGN 802.11a/g/n Wi-Fi Card\n\n\nIf you happen to have a Dell with the Intel 4965 chip then the wireless card should work out of the box. If you happen to have any of the others then I suggest you read this answer which covers all models here and more.\nSo there is no need to use a ethernet wired connection except in the case that the wireless card needs proprietary drivers (Not detected or installed during installation), in which case, you need a wired cable connection to download all updates and drivers for your wireless card (And anything missing for it) before disconnecting the cable and using the wireless card.\n", "Q: How to setup Canon InkJet Pixma IP 1300?

I have some computers which only operate on Unity 2D because of their hardware, so I rely on Unity 2D and Ubuntu 12.04. In the future I could use Gnome Shell, I could use Unity 3D via llvmpipe (which is real slow) or even LXDE, but I just love Unity 2D and its speed. Is it ever coming back for newer Ubuntu releases?\n\nA: The only way unity 2d will ever come back, is as part of petition, etc.\nIt is such a shame to see it go, maybe a community version might come about?\n\nA: Unity 2D is definitely deprecated now in favour of standard Unity via llvmpipe. It's not coming back.\nPerformance of llvmpipe may, however, continue to improve over time. I couldn't guarantee that it will ever match the speed of Unity 2D, but time will tell.\n", "Q: How to keep only ubuntu-minimal? How can I remove all packages from Ubuntu and make sure ubuntu-minimal will not be lost?\n\nA: ubuntu-minimal is a metapackage. Its function is to have other packages as dependencies. Those other packages are the packages needed for a minimal system. ubuntu-minimal does not actually provide any files directly. If you tried to remove all packages except it, you would remove its dependencies too...which would not be what you want.\nIf you recently installed software atop a minimal system and now want to get back to the minimal system, that's shouldn't be too hard. If you remember what you installed, uninstall it. If you don't, look in your logs (if the installation was recent, /var/log/apt/term.log should do the trick).\nYou could try to figure out all the packages that are direct or indirect dependencies of ubuntu-minimal that are installed on your system. Some of the indirect dependencies (i.e., dependencies of dependencies, or even further removed) may be satisfiable by different alternatives, so it's not guaranteed that causing you to have all the packages a minimal system has when it's first installed would be the same thing as removing all your currently installed packages except those necessary to preserve ubuntu-minimal. It probably wouldn't be too big a difference, though.\nPresumably something like this could be achieved, and with a minimum of hassle, by running all the removal commands here, here, here, and here (for 12.10; for another version, you'd remove all the packages list in the relevant section on that website).\n\n\n*\n\n*If you wanted to attempt this, you'd run just the apt-get remove commands, not the commands afterwards that install packages or perform configuration. So near the end of each command, sudo apt-get install ... appears. Don't run that or anything after it.\n\n*Those commands are crafted to remove what's present in one Ubuntu flavor / desktop environment, except that which is present in another. There's plenty, but not total, overlap, and specifying the same package for removal multiple times isn't a problem.\n\n*Theoretically by running all of them you could get rid of all the packages associated with each desktop environment, without having to do the work of figuring anything out. However, this would keep everything that's simultaneously in Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu, and Edubuntu, and that includes a significant number of packages, including minimal GUI packages, that aren't present in a minimal command-line only system.\n\n*For a considerably less extreme version of this (four huge commands instead of sixteen), do just the \"Remove Ubuntu\" removals at the top of each of those four pages. Assuming you have a \"vanilla\" Ubuntu system, this should take care of most of your packages. Be aware, though, that it will likely leave more than the more extreme version.\n\n*At the end, it's important that you run sudo apt-get install ubuntu-minimal. It might be automatically removed to resolve dependencies removing other packages. The pages with the commands refer to a possible bug that would cause it to be removed when running them. And generally speaking it's best not even to assume metapackages are installed in the first place.\n\n*This might not work, and it might mess things up very badly. While it's unlikely you'd experience actual loss of documents from this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Back up your documents because they should always be backed up and you're running huge commands with sudo. If nothing else, you might paste in some other huge thing by accident that causes harm when run. :)\n\n*Make sure you're prepared for your Ubuntu system to stop working completely. It might not boot. You should still be able to access its contents with a live CD/DVD/USB. Make sure to have one of those. (It's hard to try to repair the system using the alternate or minimal CD's.)\n\n\n\nIn the end, 'Call me V' is correct and you should just reinstall (though the minimal CD is just as good as the alternate CD, for installing a minimal system, and it's a considerably smaller download). Try the above suggestion for fun if you're willing to have it blow up in your face, but installing from scratch will be simpler, faster, and easier.\nIf you want someone to try to give you a better answer, detailing exactly what packages need to be removed, then you'll have to provide more information. At minimum, you should tell us what Ubuntu release you're using. But it would also help if you told us about all the packages on your system.\n\nA: It's fairly easy with aptitude. First, make sure you have it and ubuntu-minimal installed:\nsudo apt-get install aptitude ubuntu-minimal\n\nThen, mark all packages as being automatically installed, except ubuntu-minimal:\nsudo aptitude markauto '~i!~nubuntu-minimal'\n\nAfter that, you should be left with only ubuntu-minimal, and the things it depends on.\nWARNING: This doesn't include a kernel, so I suggest installing linux-image-generic immediately.\n", "Q: Problem with sound in wine and system I tried to search for my problem, but couldn't find the solution...\nThus; I'm using Ubuntu 12.04 64bit, and PlayOnLinux to play Guild Wars 2...

So, I tried, and came to conclusion that, if I start the game with paused music, I won't be able to hear it play when I unpause it (it actually plays, but without any sound)... On the other hand, if I start music and then start the game, I will not be able to get any sound from game, even if I pause the music during the play...\nI was looking through sound options in-game and fount out that if I play music before starting the game, my device list will have 3 rows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Default Device\n\n*Out: HDA Intel PCH - ALC889 Digital ((null))\n\n*Out: HDA Intel PCH - HDMI 0 ((null))\n\n\nAnd if I start the game before music I will have 4 options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Default Device\n\n*Out: HDA Intel PCH - ALC889 Digital ((null))\n\n*Out: HDA Intel PCH - HDMI 0 ((null))\n\n*Out: HDA Intel PCH - HDMI 0 ((null))\n\n\nI use classic integrated audio card with 3.5mm audio jack pluged in into my VGA TV...\nDo you have any idea what could be the problem?\nThanks.\n\nA: I have notice the same issue.

How can I block entire C class IP blocks when they send too many SYN packets to my ubuntu 12.04 server?\nExample of what I see during a SYN flood attack:\n\nEach different IP only sends 1 SYN packet, so the firewall doesn't block it. But the range 192.132.209.* all together is sending a lot of SYN packets in a very small time period.\n\nA: Taking 10.0.0.0/24 as an example, something like\niptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s 10.0.0.0/24 --syn -m limit --limit 1/s --limit-burst 3 -j RETURN\n\nshould do the job and is quite self-descriptive, so that doesn't need any explanation I guess. Here's a good, easy to read article on how to prevent TCP SYN flood attacks: Linux Iptables Limit the number of incoming tcp connection / syn-flood attacks. It explains more about the options, and provides a more extensive way too (logging, separate chain, etc.).\nI can't see the current state of your iptables from here, so you might want to add this at the top of the INPUT chain or integrate it properly in your current scripts.\n\nIn the comments you've mentioned you're looking for an automated way of finding these IP blocks. Well, I should just leave out the source address filter in the command (-s 10.0.0.0/8), so the limit will apply to the whole world.\n\nA: I've found a similar solution. Not what I wanted exactly, but very similar:\n/sbin/iptables  -A INPUT -p tcp --syn --dport 80 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 20 --connlimit-mask 24 -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset\nLimits new tcp connections (port 80) to 20 per C class block. I've found it here:\nExample: Class C Limitations\n\nA: Class C IP Address: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255.\nIn this case --connlimit-mask option must be 192.0.0.0/3 in CIDR notation.\nIf you specify a mask of 24, it will apply to Class A and Class B too. You have to use CIDR notation to specify the Class for sure.\n--connlimit-mask 192.0.0.0/24 \n\n", "Q: Is there a target package list for Ubuntu phone? I know it's not released yet.

I've removed an old HDD from a computer and to install in another computer to use for data storage (personal files, specifically tv series episodes, not system files) and the file system that I've used was the Ext4, then, for some reason I decided to install another operating system in this HDD, I used the same file system for this OS (Ext4).\nBut then I realized that this HDD, had a lot of tv series episodes that I forgot to burn into DVDs.\nNow I'd like to recovery this old data. There is any software with GUI and if possible native, available to Ubuntu, to perform this task?\nThis is the output of sudo fdisk -l for that disk:\nDisk /dev/sdb: 20.0 GB, 20019314176 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 2433 cylinders, total 39100223 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x21033f16\n\n   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sdb1   *          63    36132875    18066406+  83  Linux\n/dev/sdb2        36134910    39098367     1481729    5  Extended\n/dev/sdb5        36134912    39098367     1481728   82  Linux swap / Solaris\n\n\nA: You had one system that contained a number of video files, then a new OS installation was performed.\nIf the new system was installed without reformatting, then the files may just be there, not needing recovery at all. (Check what folders are in /home; perhaps an old home directory from a previous installation is in there, next to your own home directory in the new installation.)\nHowever, if the partitions containing the video files were removed or reformatted, and then data was written on the disk where they existed, it's highly probable the new data (from the newly installed operating system) irreversibly overwrote large parts of the video files. It's likely some parts of all of them were overwritten. This is hard to recover, it could take hours, days, weeks, or you might not succeed, and it would involve trying to repair damaged video files, since it's unlikely you'd be able to recover the files intact.\nUnless the TV episodes you lost are rare and cannot be obtained again, it's not worth it to attempt recovery. What you'll likely get from recovery after the drive was formatted and another OS installed is, at best, highly corrupted files. While better outcomes are possible, probably most of the files would cut out and stop playing altogether, somewhere in the middle. It would be one thing if you had just accidentally formatted it, but once a overwriting has happened, data recovery is only worthwhile in cases where valuable, difficult-to-reconstruct data are lost.\nIt's a hassle to get the files again, and takes time, but so does data recovery, and data recovery will likely take more of your personal time and effort (while preventing that computer, or at least that hard drive, from being put to productive use).\nUsually, I only recommend attempting data recovery if the likelihood the data has been overwritten is very low (not the case here), if the value of the lost data is very high (probably not the case), or if the data has intangible value that's hard to quantify but you are very attached to it (e.g., your own creative/artistic works regardless of whether or not they are monetizable; the only copies of pictures of your children or from a vacation with a now-deceased relative).\nStill, if you want to try, there's a slight possibility you may recover significant data. It's possible that, by chance, the files were mostly located somewhere on the disk that was not overwritten by the new OS installation.\nIf you want to attempt recovery, first take a look at this page:\n\n\n*\n\n*Data Recovery (Ubuntu wiki)\nYou would image the drive, then perform analysis on the image to recover files from it. Photorec (it's not just for pictures) might be a good analysis tool to start with.\nAlso I recommend taking a look at this question:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there any recovery software available for ext4?\nSome of these other questions may also be of help.\n", "Q: Does this need a desktop environment to run?

On the requirements page of several emulators, it says they need GTK. Does this mean they won't work without installing a desktop environment?\n\nA: You don't need any desktop environment to run GTK programs. You just need the GTK libraries. Which packages is determined by the specifics of the programs you're installing. But you can install them through Ubuntu's package manager--both the binaries and the -dev packages that provide header files for compilation (if you're building these programs from source and linking them against GTK).\nIf you provide more information about what you're installing and how you plan to install it, a more detail answer could be given.

I'd recommend using the XP driver, as I've always done with ndiswrapper. Otherwise the driver should be on the original driver CD. This thread claims you should use the rt2870.inf from the XP2K driver. Make sure you have ndiswrapper properly configured (add ndiswrapper to /etc/modules, run sudo modprobe ndiswrapper to have the driver kick in right away...). Otherwise you can try the XP64 driver if the XP2K driver fails.\nFor blacklisting rt2500usb, you can try that, you can also add rt2870sta to /etc/modules.\nThat's the best I've found on the forums, seeing as I don't own that device myself.

You cannot simply delete Windows and continue to use Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Submit merged Debian package for inclusion in Ubuntu I'm currently working to update the version of autogen shipped with Ubuntu from 1:5.12-0.1ubuntu2 in the repositories to 1:5.17.1-1 in Debian. The merge has been completed on my computer and the commit made, but I'm not sure how to proceed from here.\nFor context, I did the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*bzr branch lp:ubuntu/autogen raring\n\n*bzr merge debianlp:experimental/autogen\n\n*Resolve merge conflicts (there only was one in debain/control anyway)\n\n*dch -i\n\n*bzr commit -m \"New Debian version\"\n\n*bzr builddeb -S --package-merge\nThat last step resulted in a successful build, but now I'm a bit stumped as to my next move.

One should look at the differences between the Debian and Ubuntu packages, and figure out if each one is still needed and make sure that the ones that have, have been forwarded upstream.\nPersonally, I don't like reviewing merges done with bzr, it's really hard to figure out what's going on. So, I suggest generating a debdiff between autogen_5.17.1-1.dsc and autogen_5.17.1-1ubuntu1.dsc, and attaching that to the bug.\nStick your nose into #ubuntu-motu or #ubuntu-devel on IRC, people will be only to happy to guide you.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10 does not boot on Dell D600 I have an old Dell Latitude D600 using USB boot Ubuntu 12.10.  When booting, it said that I have the wrong kernal for my CPU.  Very odd, Ubuntu 11.10 was working just fine.  I tried the 12.10 on another PC (newer Dell), and it works.  Not sure what is going on here. \n\nA: Please see the first answer here.

Whilst installing Oracle 11gR2 Express Edition on Ubuntu 12.04 by following the Oracle 11gR2 Express Edition on Linux Ubuntu 11.10 howto and have encountered the Oracle memory target problem with /dev/shm (as documented in section 7. of that guide)  since /dev/shm is now implemented by default as a symbolic link as noted in the Ubuntu 11.10 release notes from /dev/shm to /run/shm.  The symbolic link is incompatible with what Oracle expects and this results in an Oracle error (ORA-00845: MEMORY_TARGET) on database startup.\nSection 7) of the 'Oracle 11gR2 Express Edition on Linux Ubuntu 11.10 howto' documents a startup script /etc/init.d/oracle-shm that is meant to configure /dev/shm to use Ubuntu’s /run/shm, however this does not appear to have the desired effect on Ubuntu 12.04 and /dev/shm is not mounted as expected - presumably it did work on 11.10.   Although this has already been noted and various solutions proposed I chose to work around the problem in a slightly different way by adding an entry to /etc/fstab and modifying the /etc/init.d/oracle-shm script as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adding an entry for the shared memory temporary file system to /etc/fstab, say (for a 2 gigabyte file)\nshm /dev/shm    tmpfs   size=2g 0   0\n\n\n*Changing the mount line in /etc/init.d/oracle-shm from:\nrm -f /dev/shm  \nmkdir /dev/shm\nmount -B /run/shm /dev/shm\n\nto simply \nrm -f /dev/shm\nmkdir /dev/shm \nmount /dev/shm\n\nRegardless, all the proposed solutions involve undoing the default Ubuntu behaviour at bootup, by first removing the symbolic link and then implementing the desired behaviour.\nI would like to be able to setup the shared memory file system once and for all by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adding an entry for the shared memory temporary file system to /etc/fstab, say (for a 2 gigabyte file)\nshm /dev/shm    tmpfs   size=2g 0   0\n\n\n*Remove the existing symbolic link to /dev/shm and create as a directory, as sudo.\nrm –f /dev/shm\nmkdir /dev/shm\n\n\n*Mounting the shared memory temporary file system\nmount /dev/shm\n\nThis all works fine until you reboot, at which point the symbolic link from /dev/shm to /run/shm re-appears instead of /dev/shm being mounted as a shared memory temporary file system.\nHere’s the question then.\nHow can I modify the default behaviour of Ubuntu 12.04 (& 12.10) to prevent a symbolic link from /dev/shm to /run/shm ever being created in the first place on boot up?\naction=show&redirect=OneiricOcelot/TechnicalOverview#Upgrades\n\nA: In /etc/init/mounted-dev.conf remove the line\n [ -e /dev/shm ] || ln -s /run/shm /dev/shm\n\n", "Q: Problems after installing Ubuntu 12.10 and GRUB I installed everything correctly as mentioned here.

I have a game made with the LÖVE framework and I want to package it into a .deb file so it can be easily installed by others and be easily findable through the Unity dash for example. \nI also have the LÖVE framework love_0.7.2.deb which I want to be in the deb file also somehow.\nFiles that I have:\ngame_icon.png\ngame .desktop\nthe_game.love\nlove_0.7.2.deb\n\nCould someone explain to me how to do this?\n\nA: In order to make one package depend on another, you need to specify the relationship in the debian/control file. You can read about the syntax of this file in the Ubuntu Packaging Guide. The rest of that guide will probably be helpful in giving you an overview of packaging programs for Ubuntu.\nBriefly though, your debian/control file might look something like:\nSource: my-game\nSection: devel\nPriority: optional\nMaintainer: Jane Doe <packager@example.com>\nStandards-Version: 3.9.3\nBuild-Depends: debhelper (>= 7)\nHomepage: http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/\n\nPackage: my-game\nArchitecture: any\nDepends: ${shlibs:Depends}, love (>= 0.7.2)\nDescription: a game made with the LÖVE framework\n This game is really amazing.\n .\n It has many features.\n\nEspecially note the line: \n\nDepends: ${shlibs:Depends}, love (>= 0.7.2)\n\n", "Q: Which installation drive to choose?

This is because Ubuntu uses a totally different formatting system (ext4) than Windows uses (NTFS).  Ubuntu won't run on NTFS and Windows won't run on ext4. \nAt this point you have two options:\n1. You can create a new partition for Ubuntu (shrinking one of your others) and install Ubuntu there.  NOTE:   if your using a newer computer, you might already have four (4) primary partitions, the maximum  a hard drive can support. (There are ways around this, but I don't recommend them for new users)\n2. Or you can use the Windows installer (WUBI) to safely install Ubuntu inside of Windows in a kind of virtual partition.  If you install Ubuntu this way you can uninstall it like any other Windows program, which is great for beginners. \nI recommend using WUBI if this is your first time using Ubuntu and aren't sure you want to commit.  Using WUBI eliminates accidental mistakes while partitioning, making it a safer route for beginners.\n", "Q: Why can't I delete a file even though I have write permissions?

Occasionally the sound of the Flash player breaks and remains broken until I restart my system. This happens especially often when I play videos from epicfail dot com. Like every second video or so.\nBy \"broken\" I mean that it sounds like... er... well... farting. While it does seem to have something to do with the actual video sound (in terms of volume for example) it is absolutely unintelligible. \nWhen the Flash sound is broken, it is broken for every flash instance - videos, games, etc. Restarting the browser or shift-esc -> plugin-shockwave-flash-> end-process does NOT fix it. The sound in other applications (Rhythmbox, Movie Player, Installed games) works fine. Only Flash seems to be affected.\nRestarting the computer fixes it (until it gets broken again). So far it hasn't happened if I'm watching Youtube videos or playing Kongregate games. Epicfail is the surest way to break it, and it does happen every once in a while after a Wimp video.\nSo, has anyone experienced this? Is there a way of fixing it, or if not, at least getting it to work again without having to restart my machine?\n\nA: Try restarting pulseaudio by sending a regular SIGTERM signal to it (it will recover). In the terminal run:\nkillall pulseaudio\n\nThat tends to fix the problem for me.\nOne more option is going to chrome://plugins (location bar), and disable \"pepperflash\".\n\nA: Just want to say that I ran into this problem and the solution was unexpected so I thought I'd share here.\nThere was another process using pulseaudio (a CLI music app) that starts on bootup, and I just have it paused when not using it. This process was monopolizing the flash player and preventing my browser from playing sound.\nIf anyone else runs into this, make sure to check and see if you have any other apps/processes using flash.\n\nA: I had the same symptom on Chrome v 26.0.1410.63 on Ubuntu 10.04. \nI have two Adobe Flash plugins registered in Chrome (both were enabled). When I disabled /opt/google/chrome/PepperFlash/libpepflashplayer.so (version 11.7.700.169) and left /usr/lib/adobe-flashplugin/libflashplayer.so (version 11.2 r202) enabled, the problem was fixed.

I was trying to Rename the folder Trash to Crap.\nI did this \nI first ran cd /home/username/.local/share/\nNow my present working directory is /home/username/.local/share\nthen when I typed ls I could see the folder Trash.\nthen I renamed it to Crap by typing mv Trash Crap\nand then when I again typed ls I could see that the folder was renamed to Crap but on the launcher when I open the Trash folder it's still named as Trash and not Crap. Why is that so? \n\nA: From the Freedesktop Trash Specification:\n\nFor every user a “home trash” directory MUST be available. Its name\n  and location are $XDG_DATA_HOME/Trash ; $XDG_DATA_HOME is the base\n  directory for user-specific data, as defined in the Desktop Base\n  Directory Specification .\n\nSo, no. It seems there is no way to rename the directory. \nHowever, you can make a soft link with the name you want, and then hide the Trash directory:\nln -s ~/.local/share/Trash ~/.local/share/Crap\necho Trash > ~/.local/share/.hidden\n\nNot every file explorer will honor this .hidden file, for example the terminal itself. However, it seems to work properly on Nautilus.\n\nA: Yeah, you can abuse the translations system to do this.\nMake a temporary text file using gedit\ngedit /tmp/foo.po\n\nand enter this text into it:\n\nmsgid \"Trash\"\nmsgstr \"Crap\"\n\nChange to /usr/share/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES\ncd /usr/share/locale/en/LC_MESSAGES\n\nAnd then apply changes\nsudo msgfmt -o unity.mo /tmp/foo.po\n\nNow restart unity to make the changes take effect.\nunity --replace\n\n\nSource: https://askubuntu.com/a/225023/17722\n\nA: Go to http://ubuntu-tweak.com/\nThere you can download the program and use it to change it to whatever you want.

However, doesn't this make it more vulnerable to hackers also, as they can alter the code in a malicious way more easily?\nDo the code or updates undergo some review before being released to the public?\nThanks.\n\nA: My understanding is that when an update is released, it is reviewed by the whole sayd community and then published. So i think it would be very hard to slip some bad code in when so many people who know their code, watch the code very deeply before it gets published.\nWhy it is a double-edged sword tough is that it's being developed by a big community who don't all work under one company with a single view on things.

I used to be able to move the icons permanently but now I can only change their positions until I reboot. I couldn't say for sure when the problem first presented.\nTo chaskes:\nI know how to do all this stuff but, from my original post:\n\n...how on earth can icons be moved permanently so that after the next\n  boot they are where they were left?\n\nI'm trying to say that I have the following icons, in this order:\nDash Home, Chromium, Firefox, Thunderbird, Blue Fish, Filezilla, Picasa etc. I can move them wherever I want. But if I reboot they are back in the order shown above, as though this is a default order. It's not alphabetical, as you can see.\nTo blvdeer:\nYes, you understand what I want and you are getting near, I think. If I run the command you gave:\n\ngsettings get com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites\n\n\nI get this:\n['chromium-browser.desktop', 'firefox.desktop',\n'/home/Scooby2/.launcher/Thunderbird.desktop', 'bluefish.desktop',\n'filezilla.desktop', '/home/Scooby2/.launcher/Picasa 3.desktop',\n'gimp.desktop', ....]\n\n(The four dots represent the rest of the file, omitted for simplicity.) It is slightly different in its content, I don't know why. However I can then drag the icons to where I want them. If I run the same command again, the list shows the new order - which I can save to a file or script. However if I run \ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites\n\"['/usr/share/app-install/desktop/dvdstyler-data:dvdstyler.desktop',\n'kde4-kdenlive.desktop', 'gimp.desktop', 'vlc.desktop',\n'ssvnc.desktop', ....]\"\n\n(The four dots represent the rest of the file, omitted for simplicity) I get this:\n\nUsage:   gsettings [--schemadir SCHEMADIR] set SCHEMA[:PATH] KEY VALUE\nSet the value of KEY to VALUE\nArguments:   SCHEMADIR A directory to search for additional schemas\n  SCHEMA    The name of the schema   PATH      The path, for relocatable\n  schemas   KEY       The key within the schema   VALUE     The value to\n  set\n\nIf this command would run I could put it in a script to run at start-up to rewrite the Unity Launcher order - problem not solved but a work around effected. Looking at the man page for gsettings and Googling for help makes me realise how complex this is and how little I know. Does anybody have any ideas?\n\nA: To change the order of icons in the Launcher, you can drag them to a new position. Just left click the icon and hold, drag it to where you want it to be, then release。\nA note on the click and hold: You can immediately drag the icon to the right; that is, off the launcher before dragging it back to a new position. Before you can move the icon vertically without dragging it off the launcher, you need to wait a second or two before moving it. Otherwise, you will scroll the launcher icons.

Overall, this seems a bit unlikely, but it's the possibility that I hope is correct.\n\n*Your firmware is one of the many broken designs that violates the EFI spec and boots Windows despite the fact that another boot loader is correctly configured as the default.\n\n\nThere are several possible solutions, depending on which of these things is happening and your personal preferences for how to proceed. These include:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot a Linux emergency disc in EFI mode and type sudo efibootmgr -c -p 2 -d /dev/sda -l \"\\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi\" -L \"Ubuntu\" to re-register Ubuntu's boot loader with the ESP. You may need to change /dev/sda if your method of booting changes what is currently /dev/sda to something else. Depending on the disc you use, you may also need to install efibootmgr and perhaps do an insmod efivars before using efibootmgr. This method will work only if my first hypothesis about what is wrong is correct.\n\n*Run the Boot Repair tool and tell it to fix things. This has a high probability of working and is easy to do, but it will likely do so in a way that could create further problems down the road. If it doesn't work, it will become harder to disentangle everything.\n\n*Mount the EFI System Partition (ESP; your /dev/sda2), move the EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi file down one level (so that it's EFI/Microsoft/bootmgfw.efi), and then copy EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi to EFI/Microsofot/Boot/bootmgfw.efi. This is the key thing that Boot Repair would do, but done in a slightly different way. You'll then need to modify your /boot/grub/grub.cfg file before you'll be able to boot Windows. I'm not sure if the update-grub script will pick up the change automatically. It might, but if not, you'll need to create a new Windows entry in /etc/grub.d/40_custom for the new location of bootmgfw.efi.\n\n*Download and install my rEFInd program. There are several ways to do this, each with its own quirks and caveats. If you can get your non-booting installation to boot, say by using Super GRUB 2 Disk, installing the Debian package is likely (but not certain) to succeed.

I changed the port to something non-standard (57757) and then set my router to forward to that port. On my LAN, I'm able to ssh into my machine fine using port 57757, but not able to do so on the WAN. \nIf I'm outside the LAN, and I try to access my machine by an incorrect port, I immediately get a \"connection refused\" message. However, with the correct port it just hangs and then timeouts. \nWhat can I try to debug the issue? I tried a traceroute, but it didn't tell me anything useful.\nEDIT: I realized that my problem was that my router didn't support accessing it by WAN IP internally. I ssh'd out to a different server and back in and it worked fine.\n\nA: Usually this means you've forwarded the port to the wrong IP address on the LAN.\nYour NAT router receives incoming traffic on port 57757, and sends it to a particular IP address and port on the LAN.\nBy default, Ubuntu doesn't filter incoming connection attempts with a firewall. So unless you've changed firewall settings in Ubuntu, an attempt to open a connection to any TCP port, 1 through 65535, will either:\n\n\n*\n\n*accept the connection, if the port is open\n\n*reject the connection attempt, if the port is closed\n\n\nIf ports were filtered by a firewall, then you'd get what you're seeing--no response to a connection attempt. But:\n\n\n*\n\n*unless you've changed firewall settings (e.g., ufw, iptables), no ports are filtered, and\n\n*in any case, you can connect to port 22 on the LAN, so it's open.\n\n\nWhen you forward a port to a nonexistent machine with a NAT router, it sends incoming traffic on that port to the nonexistent machine, which is to say that it sends it into a black hole; it is effectively dropped.\nThat causes exactly the situation you've described. So you can most likely fix this by making sure the port is being forwarded to the correct IP address on the LAN.\nIf that turns out not to have been the problem...\n...then you'll have to do some troubleshooting.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is the port specified for the LAN side correct? That is, assuming you haven't changed the SSH server's configuration, is port 57757 on the WAN side set to forward to port 22 on the OpenSSH server? (You may want to double-check this.)\n\n*Maybe there's some problem with the specific port you've chosen (57757). Try a different one and see if that works better.\n(If it doesn't, and you proceed with these instructions, either change it back or replace \"57757\" below with the new number.)\n\n*Try restarting the OpenSSH server. That may help if there is a network problem. If that doesn't help, try restarting the router and cable/DSL/ISDN modem too.\nIf for some reason you cannot restart all three devices, I recommend restarting whatever you can. If you can't restart the OpenSSH service, at least you can restart the service and (more likely to fix this) take the interface down and bring it up again.\nTo restart the OpenSSH server:\nsudo restart ssh\n\nTo bring the network interface down, first figure out what interface it's on:\nifconfig\n\nTypically, for a machine with a single Ethernet card and/or a single wireless card, the Ethernet is eth0 and the wireless is wlan0.\nIf the wired Ethernet connection is what you want to take down and restart, run:\nsudo ifdown eth0\n\nThen run:\nsudo ifup eth0\n\nAlternatively, you can run:\nsudo ifconfig eth0 down\n\nFollowed by:\nsudo ifconfig eth0 up\n\nIf the machine is using NetworkManager to manage the interface on which the OpenSSH server is running, I still recommend trying the above ways, but you can also try disconnecting and reconnecting in NetworkManager.\nFor an Ethernet connection, also try unplugging the cable and plugging it back in. For a wireless connection, try turning it off with the hardware switch (if there is one), and back on again.\nSomething strange is going on here and none of this takes very long--it's worthwhile to be thorough before undertaking more painstaking troubleshooting steps.\n\n*How are you attempting to access it from the WAN side? If you're using a machine on the LAN to do this (just connecting from the LAN to your router's WAN IP), this is only supported for some routers. After all, a router's job is to route traffic between the WAN and LAN sides, not to route traffic from one side to itself. Support for connecting to forwarded ports on the WAN IP from inside the LAN is actually the exception rather than the rule, though many home/office routers do have this feature.\nSo if you're not testing the port forward from a host on the WAN side, you should do so. Your options for this are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Connect yourself from the WAN side. This works if you have access to a machine there, for example, SSH access to a remote machine at school, work, a friend's house, or similar.\n\n*Connect the test machine between the router and whatever provides its Internet connection. If you have a cable/DSL/ISDN modem with an Ethernet port and your router is plugged into that, you can connect a switch to the modem and connect the router to the switch. Connect a computer to the switch. First see if that machine just gets Internet access--these days, many ISP's provide two or more separate IP addresses. If it doesn't, go to your router's setup page and check its WAN IP and WAN subnet mask, then statically assign an IP address to the switch-connected machine that is within the same subnet.\nThis method has some disadvantages. It's a pain! Also, it's theoretically possible for an ISP to configure their network incorrectly so that the test machine connected to the switch could access the Internet. (Unless it's your ISP's intention to let you connect with more than one WAN IP and you happen to have picked a WAN IP for the test machine that your ISP has assigned to you, traffic between it and a true WAN host should be blocked/dropped by the ISP. But some ISP's have weird practices, so who knows?) If this happens, it won't likely cause anyone serious problems (and even if it did, you only have it connected for up to a few minutes). However, it could potentially be seen as an attempt to obtain additional access beyond the bounds of your subscription, and--more importantly--if another user has that same IP, it could intefere with their connection. Therefore, if you want to try this method, don't try to access the Internet from the test machine, stop immediately if you find the test machine can access the Internet, and don't attempt this at all if it's prohibited or advised against by your ISP. (And don't use this if the WAN side of your router is an office LAN, without consulting your network administrator first. That's not an ISP and there's no assumption that resources are provisioned to prevented undesired access.)\nThere is a variation on this technique that is sometimes more appropriate. Your router probably gets its connection information--IP address, subnet mask, the IP address of the gateway (router) on the WAN that it uses when it doesn't know where to send something, and information about DNS servers--from your ISP, via DHCP, through the cable/DSL/ISDN modem. This is why you have to have the router plugged into the modem to give it the necessary configuration to make the results of WAN-side testing meaningful. But the router will typically remember this information, so long as it is actually connected to a network on the WAN side. So you can connect the router, modem, and test machine, but then, quickly, and before doing anything with the test machine besides making sure the switch sees it as connected, disconnect the modem.\n\n*Use an free service on the Internet to test your ports. Since inserting a test machine between your router's WAN interface and the Internet (above) is highly involved--and since it will show a port as accessible even if it's inaccessible due to being blocked by your ISP (which is also true of connecting to the router's WAN IP from the LAN side)--it's usually better to use a web-based port scanning service.\nThere are many port scan services. (Some sport the phrase \"check your firewall\" with the idea that most people are trying to block rather than facilitate access.) This is one. If you choose to use that one, click Proceed, type 57757 into the text box, and click Use Specified Custom Port Probe. For the purposes of getting a server to run, you want it to be \"open.\" \"Closed\" means the port is accessible but the server is not running (and thus the connection attempt was rejected). \"Stealth\" means the port was inaccessible--it's as if no machine was located there (or as if the port were forwarded where there's no machine).\n\n\n*OK, so you've determined it really isn't accessible from the Internet. Potentially you can scan it (ideally from the WAN side) to get details, though often this won't give helpful information.\nIf you want to do this, then on the WAN side, you can run:\nsudo nmap -sS -sV -p57757 -vv WAN-IP\nIf the port is shown as filtered, that confirms that packets sent there are probably going nowhere (or are blocked/dropped along the way).\n\n*It's worth checking to see if the problem is arising from the port exposed to the WAN being different from the port the server is actually listening on. Forwarding port 55757 on the WAN to port 22 on the LAN machine should make things work out fine, but perhaps somewhere (the server, the client) something is assuming the port number is the same from the server and client's perspective.\nPresumably you cannot forward port 22 through the router. Perhaps your ISP blocks that port. But if you can do that, do that!\nOtherwise, you can make the OpenSSH server actually listen on port 57757.\nTo do this, back up the server configuration file:\ncd /etc/ssh\nsudo cp sshd_config sshd_config.old\n\nThen edit it:\ngksu gedit sshd_config\n\nOr use a console text editor if the machine doesn't have a GUI:\nsudo nano -w sshd_config\n\nNear the top of the file, this block of text appears:\n# What ports, IPs and protocols we listen for\nPort 22\n# Use these options to restrict which interfaces/protocols sshd will bind to\n#ListenAddress ::\n#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0\nProtocol 2\n# HostKeys for protocol version 2\nHostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key\nHostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key\nHostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key\n#Privilege Separation is turned on for security\nUsePrivilegeSeparation yes\n\nJust change the Port 22 line at the top, to say Port 57757 instead.\n\n\n*\n\n*You could add a port rather than changing it. I recommend testing with the simplest effective configuration, though.\nSee man sshd_config for more details about configuring the OpenSSH server.\nSave the file, quit the text editor, and restart the SSH server with:\nsudo restart ssh\n\nNow change the port forward on the router so port 57757 forwards to port 57757 (not 22) on the OpenSSH server, and see if it's accessible from the Internet.\n\n*If it's still not working, see if maybe Ubuntu's firewall actually is blocking traffic originating from outside the LAN.\n(This is unlikely if you didn't configure it this way yourself, but if all your settings are right and none of the above steps revealed anything about the problem, it's worth checking.)\nRun:\nsudo iptables -L\n\nBy default, in Ubuntu, the output looks like:\nChain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \n\nChain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination         \n\nChain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)\ntarget     prot opt source               destination\n\nThis is a simple permissive policy, essentially equivalent to not running a firewall. (Indeed, if the netfilter firewall module weren't compiled into your kernel, your system would behave the same way as with the above settings, although the iptables command, which queries netfilter's settings, wouldn't work of course.)\nIf your configuration doesn't look like that, read man iptables to figure out what they're doing, and/or edit your question (or, if you're a different person with a similar problem reading this, post a new question) to include them. Please note that, potentially, your iptables rules could disclose sensitive information about your configuration. Practically speaking, this is usually not the case--with the possible exception of rules about specific hosts that are blocked, or if your configuration is very bad/insecure--typically the usefulness of this information to an attacker, especially for a machine on a home/office LAN behind a NAT router, is minimal.\n\nA: As it works from inside your LAN your setup of the server seems to be correct. You must tell your router to forward from the port you want to use on the outside to port 57757 on your machine.\nA traceroute will be of no use in this case.\n", "Q: How to toggle wireless using a script My laptop comes with the option to toggle wireless with the Fn+F12 key, but unfortunately this key doesn't work.

My computer won't let me delete anything else that is big, but still doesn't have enough space.\nSo I downloaded Ubuntu 12.10 onto my USB and loaded the boot setup, however my down arrow key doesn't work so I can't make it boot from my USB and can't use WUBI because the computer thinks it needs the space. Are there any shortcuts to replace the down arrow key?\nOr any other ways to install Linux?\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS should work fine, except for GUI 'features' which will be partially disabled. I would not try 12.10 (or 13.04), other than as an experiment (that may need to be undone).\n\nYou need to fix the keyboard, but using Tab should work for now. I assume you need this key to work in BIOS.\n\nA: I would rather take the newest version of Xubuntu or Lubuntu than an old version of Ubuntu (definitely nothing that is out of support).\nXubuntu should work just fine with a GUI and all the other stuff. I used it once with an older PC (1GB RAM, AMD 2600+) and it was pretty fast.\nAnd if the Hardware is that old/bad there are still ditros like tinyCore\n", "Q: QT creator tutorial: Itemstyle invalid Running the Currencyconverter tutorial \"itemstyle\" in the following line is underlined with red:\nItemStyle.class: \"title\"\n\nwith an error \"invalid property name\"\nHow to fix this error?\n\nA: You can fix the invalid property name if you import the Ubuntu.Components as Theming:\nimport QtQuick 2.0\nimport Ubuntu.Components 0.1\nimport Ubuntu.Components 0.1 as Theming\n\nHowever, the fact that the editor shows it underlined with red does not mean it doesn't work - it works just fine even if it's red.

Eventally I did Ctrl-C and it booted.\nI only have 1 file system in /etc/fstab (other than proc & swap).\nIs this supposed to happen? I searched for other posts in AskUbuntu about recovery mode, and from what I can tell, it should continue somehow after doing the fsck(s).\nI did find link which seems to have same behavior but in that case the system was unbootable.\nI also booted from 12.04.1 Live DVD and selected 'Test Linux' and manually ran\nsudo fsck /dev/sdb5\nwhich ran for about the same time (10 seconds) and also didn't find any errors.\nMy system dual boots Linux & Windows 7 and Windows C: is an SSD.\n\nA: It definitely is not \"supposed\" to do that - but it happens.\nWorkaround: in the recovery menu just select Drop to root shell prompt\n\nand inside try  \nsudo fdisk -l\n\nto get a list of drives and partitions\nmount\n\nshould give something like\n/dev/sdb5 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro)\n\nand then with the partition you just found\nsudo fsck -f /dev/sdb5\nsudo mount /dev/sdb5 / -o remount,rw\n\nfsck -f forces a check, even if there is no indication of a problem on the partition.\nNow your root partition is error free and mounted (rw). You would now be able to do anything there with root permissions - so be careful!\n\nA: It seems this is a known bug: system hangs after selecting certain menu items in Recovery Menu (Launchpad bug 1061239).\n\nA: If you don't boot with the splash screen, then the hotkeys for mountcheck are not visible. The system is actually waiting for \"M\" for maintenance shell, \"F\" to fix FSCK problems, \"S\" to skip fsck, or \"C\" to cancel a check.

I looked at all the posts on Internet and come up no working solution. I install nvidia-current than remove , install nvidia-current-update than remove. I tried all the possibilities that are proposed on internet. Only working solution was removing all the nvidia related packages with apt-get remove nvidia* then installing nouveau by apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-nouveau. It takes all the things as usual but I guess without correct nvidia driver. Am I installing wrong driver or what? Wha might be the problem?\nMy graphical card is Geforce GT635M on Ubuntu 12.10 \n\nA: MY solution goes with the link https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee#Installation\n\nA: There's nothing wrong with using the Nouveau driver if it is working for you.  It's simply the open-source driver that is freely available.  Problems with the proprietary NVidia device modules on some older cards means that the Nouveau driver is sometimes the best option.  \nThank goodness for the Xorg nouveau driver!\n\nA: If I understand correctly that when using the Nvidia drivers, you're seeing only the desktop and not Unity, then it seems to me you ran into this bug (there are a few variations of it):\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers/+bug/1070392\nIf this is indeed the case, than for some reason, kernelheaders related to you graphic display (headers essetially link different bits of the kernel or kernel and userspace together) got corrupted. I had the same problem. In my case it was caused by switching to a low-latency kernel. Switching back to the regular 12.10 kernel didnt help because the headers stayed the same.\nI resolved it by falling back to the 12.04 kernel from which I upgraded a few months back. In 12.04 the Nvidia drivers worked correctly. I removed the later kernels and then upgraded again. This fixed it and now I am again running Nvidia prop drivers on 12.10\nIn your case however that is not a direct option because you dont have a 12.04 kernel to fall back to. \nIn some cases this:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers/+bug/1070392/comments/7\nwill work.\nIf it doesnt, what you may have to do a reinstall of Ubuntu.Thats not as dramatic as it sounds, providing you have your /home in a seperate partition.

After the install  I did not get the option of choosing OS and directly went to Windows XP. \nI think it has something to do with GRUB, but I'm not really sure.\nPlease help. \nThank's \n\nA: Grub2 probably got installed on the Ubuntu hard drive, while the machine is booting off the First (Windows) drive.  Change the boot order in BIOS to boot off the second hard drive first and you should either get a boot menu with both OS's listed, or it may boot directly into Ubuntu.\nIf it boots directly into Ubuntu then you should update the grub boot menu with the command \nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: Allow creating directories from applications I just started using Ubuntu a week ago. I noticed that applications don't have permissions to create directories. E.g. I can't create a new directory from my LibreOffice Writer save as dialog.\nCan I do something to change that and is it wise to do so?\n\nA: You have default permissions to write and create folders in your home directory.  You do not have default permissions to write or create folders anywhere else.\nYou home folder will be found at /home/username/ and most applications like LibreOffice will default to here, or possibly /home/username/Documents\nWith a few exceptions it's a bad habit to get into writing elsewhere in the filesystem for just data.  These special cases are set up with special permissions and are for specific purposes - eg /media/username.\nIf you are having problems writing to your home directories or creating folders in them then it might indicate that there is a permissions problem which needs to be addressed.\n\nA: Any application that you start runs with exactly the same permissions as you have - so LibreOffice can create folders where you are allowed to do it.\nYou should keep all your own files within the tree of your home directory, that makes backups easier - there you will have full permissions to create folders, documents etc.\n", "Q: How do I install ra3290.bin wireless driver into /lib/firmware I have a HP ENVY dv7 that has the rt3290 wireless card.

Can someone give me the steps necessary to ehtirely getting rid of ubuntu and then installing/booting Windows 8 from my SD card?\n\nA: Note: Do you have a Windows 8 Product key? Windows 8 now requires the product key at the start of the installation. Unlike XP/Vista/7 where you had a certain trial period after it was installed.

I'm wondering if it is possible to change evince font rendering and make it render fonts like Adobe Acrobat Reader.\n\nA: Evince uses default system fonts when they're specified in the document, and custom ones when they're embedded. This suggests that the problem may be with your font set. If this is the case, I suggest making sure that ttf-mscorefonts is installed and up-to-date.\nAnother possibility is that the document is using embedded fonts that may be corrupted or just didn't download properly. You can check the fonts by selecting \"Properties\" from the menu and the \"Fonts\" tab (I can't post an image because I don't have enough reputation...).\nOther discussion of this issue have referenced other PDF readers, the most popular being Okular (KDE), xpdf, and epdfview. You may want to try one of these to see if you prefer them, but I haven't seen any clear solution to the question of why fonts would render better in any of these other applications than in evince.\n", "Q: Missing volume app from notification area in Xubuntu panel! The volume control icon is missing from the panel. The n/w and battery icons are shown. When I try to edit the Notification Area from the Panel preferences I see the volume is not available as a known app. I need help. Am a newbie :)\n\nA: I ran into this in an Ubuntu installation that I had installed the xfce4 pacakage on, not a proper Xubuntu installation. But in case if anyone else has the same problem, I had to install the indicator-sound-gtk2 package:\nsudo apt-get install indicator-sound-gtk2\n\nand then log out/log back in.\n\nA: The volume control icon is part of the xfce4-indicator-plugin, which can contain various icons. You can accidentally remove the volume control icon, which will close the plugin; when it is running it is listed in system monitor as xfce4-indicator-plugin.\nTo return to your old panel setup as displayed here:       , please follow these instructions.   \n(Only the volume and mail icons are actually part of the indicator plugin; the networking and power-management icons are separate plugins).\n1) Just right-click the panel and go to panel preferences, as in the screenshot below:\n\n2) Then, just make sure the appropriate panel is selected, move to the items tab and click the green + in the items tab (not the one at the top of the screen) to add an item.\n\n3) Now, scroll down the list and select the indicator-plugin, click add, and close the menus. Your volume control icon and mail icons will be restored.\n\nThis should sort out your problem unless you have uninstalled some xfce4 items or icons.\n\nA: That's not intuitive. \nYou need an icon separate from the notification area called \"sound icon\" or \"volume control.\"\nThis is a common problem.\n(EDIT: answer in 16.04 be sure to install & add to panel: \n'xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin' current version is 0.2.4-1 as of 7/2017\nSeems to work fine, ugly icon but you can also just hover & mousewheel it up and down. )\nI was using an indicator that I like better than the standard one,that shipped with 13.04 to 16.04 (I think) using the indicator-plugin, it is called \"Volti\" and it's available for Precise and Oneric. (EDIT... AND the rest up to ZESTY. Current version 0.2.3-7 from Zesty works on 16.04 as well.) Simply add it using Synaptic (or, I imagine, the Ubuntu Software Center.) This uses ALSA without having to use Pulse Audio, as well.\nUnfortunately there is a problem where it does not work after resume from suspend! :( Have to kill it then restart it.\nInfo: code.google.com/p/volti/‎\n\nA: sudo apt-get install xfce4-mixer  \n\nThis installs a plugin that you can add straight to any panel.\n\nA: I am missing the volume icon in Xubuntu 14, and the solution here didn't work for me (I already had the Indicator plugin added to the panel). The only way that worked (and I also use this when the panel has other issues too), is to restart the panel, using:\nxfce4-panel -r\n\nI actually have this setup as an alias in ~/.bashrc since I run into panel issues as lot.\nalias panelbug='xfce4-panel -r'\n\n\nA: Similar to @Ulad answer, if you want to install a sound plugin that will work with your panel, try  \nsudo apt-get install xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin\n\nThat worked for a new install of xUbuntu 16.04LTS where I'm using the notification area instead of the buggy \"indicator plugin\".\n", "Q: Why aren't new programs showing up in the KDE menu?

My understanding is that the first takes precedence but it's possible some weird confusion may be occurring?  \n\nPlease look at Opera.desktop again. See if you find a line, or lines, like this:\nOnlyShowIn=Unity\n\nA list of other OnlyShowIn= options is here.\nIf there is such a line, open Opera.desktop with a text editor (and sudo) and comment out that line by adding #. Save the file. You may now see Opera in your menu.\nYou can read more on the subject here. The \"opposite\" of OnlyShowIn= is NotShowIn= and if there's a line like NotShowIn=KDE that could be to blame.\nAnd you may need to refresh things by running  \nsudo update-desktop-database\n\naccording to this answer.\nOf course, it's entirely possible that there's some other solution altogether!\n", "Q: Downloading a previously purchased app with Ubuntu Software Center Fresh install of Ubuntu 12.10 but I want to claim a purchase of Minecraft that I bought with the old install using Ubuntu Software Center.

In our cloud, we generate MACs with the prefix 2c:c2:60 for instances.\nWhen we re-use an instance, or duplicate it, the new copy gets another MAC address.\nWhen the new copy boots, the NIC gets the name eth1 due to the new MAC.\nI see that in /lib/udev/rules.d/75-persistent-net-generator.rules, there are rules for known prefixes such as 52:54:00 (KVM) and VMWare (00:0c:29).\nBut this file should not be edited as stated in its first line.\nWe would like to use our own registered MAC prefix and not others' ones.\nHow to disable net rules generation completely?\n\nA: Based on JasminJ's answer, I read the manual. Well, I read a very small portion of it. The fifth sentence in the \"Rules files\" section states:\n\nThis can be used to override a system-supplied rules file with a local file if needed; a symlink in /etc with the same name as a rules file in /lib, pointing to /dev/null, disables the rules file entirely.\n\nI just tested this with a VM and it does indeed work as described. I prefer this to conventional/hacky methods of disabling this functionality.\nHere is the command\nln -s /dev/null /etc/udev/rules.d/75-persistent-net-generator.rules\n\n\nA: cd /etc/udev/rules.d\nrm -f 70-persistent-net.rules\nrm -f 75-persistent-net-generator.rules\necho \"# \" > 75-persistent-net-generator.rules\n\nSee https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/udev/udev.html\nchapter \"Rules files\"\n\nA: You can override the /lib/udev/rules.d/* by copying them to /etc/udev/rules.d and then modifying them.\nOr alternatively, you can create a new file with a lexically higher name e. g. /etc/udev/rules.d/99-stop-persistent-net.rules with the following \"do nothing\" entry:\nSUBSYSTEM==\"net\", DRIVERS==\"?*\", NAME=\"%k\"\n\nThis should prevent new rules from being created as udev thinks the interface is already listed.

In the server guide, which is part of the official documentation, you can find a chapter for Windows Networking which contains a section on how to set up a Domain Controller.\nYou are free to use other guides, of course. But you should know how to read and follow them and how they do apply to different distributions and skills of the reader. Most projects start their documentation with how to compile the software. However when you are using a distribution like Ubuntu that provides precompiled packages, you should install the provided packages instead, because maintaining a self compiled installation can be quite a burden, as you have to compile every update and sometimes even need to backport patches.\nAlso notice that Ubuntu comes with a precompiled Samba 4 (meta)package.\n", "Q: Require duplicates to be imported in Shotwell I have some drawings that I have imported and tagged by date. Now I want to take some of them that I have organized on my disk and put give them a new tag. Shotwell thinks they are duplicates and won't import them.

I have connected to the server with putty.\nI have installed xubuntu and gdm but do not know how to login into xubuntu from putty terminal.\nAny help?\n\nA: I'm assuming you mean that you want to use graphical applications from the terminal, forgive me if I'm incorrect.\nThere are many ways to do this. I'm going to assume you mean one of the following: \n\n\n*\n\n*You can log in via ssh and then remotely start gui applications over ssh via X11. One could use this to run gui only apps on a headless machine.\n\n*You want to log in using a gui, and avoid the terminal altogether.\nFor the first solution, make sure you can send those protocols over ssh. You'll need to check the ssh config file located at /etc/ssh/sshd_config. Make sure X11 forwarding is on. You'll also need an X server on your windows machine for this to work. I've heard good things about Xming. You can check if X11 forwarding is on by running xclock on the terminal by simply typing xclock, you should see the clock show up on your screen.  \nIf what you want is to log in remotely to a gui without the terminal, you'll need some sort of vnc server on your xubuntu machine. I use vncserver which you can get by running sudo apt-get install vncserver and it does the job, although many people have noted that it lacks appropriate security. If you choose this path, make sure you have the appropriate access over the firewall and that any ports aren't blocked, or that you can tunnel the connection over your ssh port.\n", "Q: Could I make Ubuntu a rolling distro? From what I understand, Debian testing/unstable/experimental are rolling release, right? Since Ubuntu is based on Debian, could I the Debian testing repo to my software sources and make my Ubuntu a rolling release?\nWould that be possible and how would I add Debian to my sources? If it were possible, does that mean when Ubuntu 13.04 comes out, I wouldn't have to upgrade as my computer is already up to date? Unity stuff doesn't matter to me, I use Gnome Remix.\n\nA: What That Wouldn't Do\nYou can add Debian's software sources in Ubuntu the same way you add them in Debian. This will not do what you seem to be saying you want, though. You should almost certainly not do this.\nThis will not give you the same software that will appear in Ubuntu 13.04 in the future, because Ubuntu's packages are specially built for Ubuntu, incorporate some changes compared to the Debian versions, and because your package versions would almost always be ahead of the ones in Ubuntu (especially on Ubuntu 13.04's release date, which would take place well after a freeze on the introduction of new features).\nUbuntu's packages are not identical to the packages in Debian, and you cannot get the same exact packages through an official Debian software source that you get through an official Ubuntu software source.\nWhat That Might Do\nIf you added Debian's experimental software sources to your Ubuntu system, they would almost always have higher-versioned packages than provided by the Ubuntu software sources (since most Ubuntu packages come from Debian). Consequently all the software in your system would be upgraded to the Debian experimental versions. This upgrade process would very likely fail, leaving your system or the package manager in a non-functional state.\nHowever, if it succeeded, the result would be a Debian experimental system that happens to have some Ubuntu repositories enabled (but providing almost no software).\nYou mentioned that you don't need \"Unity and stuff.\" By \"and stuff\" I presume you mean other packages present in Ubuntu but not Debian. Since you don't need any Ubuntu packages and you're interested in using a system where all the packages are provided by Debian's official software sources, it sounds like what you really want to do is use Debian.\nDebian, like Ubuntu, is an excellent operating system. Go for it!\nBut please don't try to \"upgrade\" an Ubuntu system to Debian; you should install Debian in an officially supported way. If you want to use experimental packages, you can get plenty of excitement that way, and find and report bugs while you're at it. In contrast, there's not much value to making a broken Debian system out of an Ubuntu system.\nTo Stay on the Bleeding Edge of Ubuntu\nIf you want to use the latest development packages for Ubuntu 13.04 before it comes out, then instead of using Debian's experimental software sources, you should test 13.04.\nNew, experimental installation ISO's for Ubuntu come out every day and can be downloaded here. Once installed your alpha Raring Ringtail system will get lots of updates and plenty of stuff won't work right. It might even not work at all, or stop working at some point. (That's what it's like to use the most experimental software available.)\nIt's fun, though I don't recommend this for a system you rely on, even casually.\nIf you want you can upgrade an Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal Quetzal system to alpha Raring:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo do-release-upgrade -d\n\nIf alpha testing interests you, check out these resources:\n\n*\n\n*The testing wiki.\n\n*The bug reporting guidelines.\n\n*A list of resources for getting help with problems in alpha and beta releases.\n\n*The Raring Ringtail Alpha 1 release announcement.\n\nA: The simple answer is no. \nRegular Ubuntu releases are based on Debian Unstable, and some vanilla Debian packages are incompatible with Ubuntu (and vise-versa). Expect problems after adding Debian testing to Raring.\nTo summarize, either use Debian Testing, Debian Unstable, or Ubutnu Development branches. Either of them is, in a way, a rolling release, and if you use 13.04, and keep installing updates, it should bring you up to the release version.

I used the compatibility mode to install Linux Mint and then installed the latest driver from AMD. So download these first onto an USB stick.\nYou need to switch to the console after the install pressing CTRL-ALT-F1. Now the console will also flicker now and then so you will need to concentrate when you type. Easy way out is probably installing the ssh-common package and to do it remote via ssh from another box or tablet even.\nNow I'm not 100% sure if this was needed but I also ran \"sudo apt-get remove fglrx\" to remove any drivers which might be used. After that you'll need to reboot. Then switch to the console again and mount the USB drive \"sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt\", unzip the zip file on the USB stick \"unzip amd-driver-installer-catalyst-13.1-linux-x86.x86_64.zip\" and to run the file as root \"sudo bash ./amd-driver-installer-catalyst-13.1-linux-x86.x86_64.run\".

It works fine, and connects using putty on my Windows installation, so why doesn't it work using the built in ssh client on Ubuntu?\n\nA: Since you cannot even get the ssh client to connect, you can rule out things like password/key auth, root logins, etc. Possible reasons why you cannot connect:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wrong port. Maybe you misread you PuTTY configuration.\n\n*Locked out of your VPS because of too many failed connection attempts (firewall rules, Fail2ban)\n\n*Port knocking daemon. Maybe your VPS firewall configuration requires you to send data to certain ports before the SSH ports opens. (not sure if PuTTY is that advanced though).\n\n*VPN required. Perhaps you could connect to your VPS because it was tunnelled through a VPN connection which was activated on Windows, but not on Ubuntu.\n\n*IP mismatch. Ensure that you are connecting to the same IP address. The IP address could change if you override it in /etc/hosts (or the Windows equivalent) or have a strange DNS server.\n\n*Outbound blocking. You have a router that is very restrictive and had to add a rule for the Windows IP address to allow for connecting/forwarding to that SSH port. On your Linux installation, you got a different IP address.\n\n\nA: Normally (by default), SSH does not allow connection to root.

I have a pretty decent laptop (Intel Core i7-3520M CPU @ 2.90GHz, SataII SSD from Samsung, 8GB Ram), but I not satisfied with my boot and shutdown times...\nI have installed bootchart, and am trying to interpret it, but I don't understand some parts.\n\nIn particular, I don't get what is happening during the first 10 seconds, when there is almost no CPU utilization, nor I/Os. What is happening then ? (there seem to be only udevd, modprobe and plymouth running).\nOn the other end of my daily work, I also experiente slow shutdown. No shotdown chart here, so I'm even more clueless...\nUpdate\nI have come accross a hint saying hitting the up key while shutting down gives access to the console (I had been fighting with F1 / Alt F1 before that). So I have seen that the long shutdown time seems to have to do with rpcbind and modem-manager being unable to quit cleanly... Any idea?\nUpdate 2\nI have uninstalled rpcbind, as well as modemmanager. This made things better for shutdown, but I still have several seconds waiting between the 'All processes ended within 1 seconds' message, and the real shutdown. Just then, I get a quick message I was unable to read yet, but I suspect some sort of timeout to occur...\nUpdate 3\nOk, I think I have narrowed things down to the execution of resume and wait-for-root during the first 10 seconds of the boot process. This is taking more than 5 secs, with no disk nor noticable CPU activity. I noticed that swap UUID in /etc/initramfs/conf.d/resume does not match with the real UUID of my swap partition, which happens to be... crypted. Maybe that is the point ? Any hint on initramfs-tools and cryptswap ?\n\nA: Ok, I have found the problem.\nAs I was feeling, the 5 seconds waiting on resume and wait-for-root is not normal.\nGoogling around, I finally found this bug report: 5 second delay on wait-for-root\nEssentially, it states that the 5 secs wait is due to a wrong entry in /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume.\nIt turns out that my swap is encrypted, and I had the initial installation UUID in /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume.\nI tried to put the one given by blkid for /dev/mapper/cryptswap1, but it didn't work... \nI finally just commented out the entry in the file, and the 5 seconds delay is gone.\nAny way, hibernate is not enabled on my system (I think it is disabled by default in Ubuntu). Notice the # at the beginning of the entry.\n#RESUME=UUID=3835540d-0cb4-46fc-b39a-de9ff88dcefd\n\nthen run:\nsudo update-initramfs -u\n\nSo here is my latest bootchart:\n\nMuch better.\nRegarding shutdown, removing rpcbind and modemmanager did the trick.

I'm trying to install a remote desktop solution on some clients using Ubuntu with Unity (3D). I've uninstalled Unity2d because it behaves not very well.\nXrdp won't work, only the wallpaper is shown.\nThe same goes for freenx-server.\nThe only servers that seems to work properly are the vnc-based as vino. Right, VNC is okay, but it is a bit slow.\nAlso, vino is not enough. Clients can only connect if they have manually configured the vino server, and they can't connect if the session is closed. \nSure, I could install a VNC server that launched a daemon at startup, but I want the clients to login with their credentials, and, for example, tightvncserver, only gets a global password as far as i know. Perhaps it's possible to open lightdm from a tightvncserver session?\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n\n\n*\n\n*A session is started and the client should attach to the current session.\n\n*A session is not started, and the client should start a new one. Better if the client can logout and reattach to that session later, locally or remotely.\n\n\nA: I am using x2go (http://www.x2go.org/) which is based on nxclient.

I'm a recent convert from Windows to Linux and I have a question about how Ubuntu/Linux takes care of duplications of files when installing software gets messy. To use an example, let me talk about something I'm having problems with right now; installing Ruby On Rails. At some point in downloading it there was an error (not relevant to this thread) and to solve it I went back to the beginning of the installation and ran all of the required steps, re-downloading much of what I had already downloaded. I'm used to Windows just clogging everything up with duplicated files, and my sense is that Ubuntu is smarter than that. How does Ubuntu handle a user downloading multiple things? Before each installation does it check to see if some key file is already located within the system, and if it is, it doesn't download any of the files? In Terminal I've never received a message from the system saying something along the lines of,\n\"User Alex has already downloaded this package\"\nwhich is what I would expect. I would really like a detailed but non-technical explanation of what's going on here. \n\nA: Ubuntu is based on Debian, and thus uses APT. If you ever want to dive into more details, have a look at that wiki page.\n...but to address some of your question:\n\n\n*\n\n*first, the installation packages are cached in\n/var/cache/apt/archives. If a package has been cached, it won't be\ndownloaded again unless a newer version is available.\n\n*second, APT keeps track of installed packages, so that, if you try\ninstalling something that's already installed, you'll get a message, that the package is already the newest version:\n ~$ sudo apt-get install zsync\n Reading package lists... Done\n Building dependency tree       \n Reading state information... Done\n zsync is already the newest version.\n 0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.\n\n\n*third, APT usually runs as root, so that regular, unprivileged users\ndo not download and install software.\n", "Q: Google account integration in Ubuntu 12.10 I'm new to Ubuntu and I recently installed 12.10. Since I'm having problems with online accounts (including Google, which doesn't seem to integrate anything in my OS) I would like to know what exactly a Google account is used for. Does it add GMail into the messaging menu (without gm-notify or similar apps) and syncs my google calendar with the default Ubuntu calendar?\n\nA: At least for now, online accounts merely help you use the default Empathy chat program to connect with your Facebook, Google Talk, etc. friends. It doesn't sync with GMail or Google Calendar. For instance, you can use Unity Mail for your Gmail accounts, but it requires you to enter GMail account details again as it's not linked to online accounts.\n\nA: Not entirely certain this answers all of your question ... I use my Google account for consolidating 3 email accounts, then access all three with iMap in Thunderbird; web access too. Additionally Calendar and Google Drive are available. I installed Chromium as a browser so all browser settings are synchronized to my 2 pc's. Additionally the gmail consolidation of calendar and email keeps my iPhone synchronized.

Based on my experience, these built-in drivers do not connect at full speed but randomly get slower and faster, resulting in very poor performance.\nYou should go to the ralink site and download the source code for the drivers.  Then follow the instructions to compile and install.  Note that if you are running 64-bit linux, then you are out-of-luck.

I am running the new Mac Air 13\" with OS X 10.8.2. I then downloaded the latest VirtualBox 4.2.6. Then, I installed Ubuntu 10.04 into the VM.\nFirst off, after I installed the VirtualBox Guest Additions and restarted the VM, the Ubuntu desktop froze after the GDM login and I had to delete the VBoxGuestAdditions folders out of /opt and /usr/lib to get back to normal again.\nSecond, I go to Ubuntu's System > Preferences > Monitors and try to change the settings, and there's nothing higher than 800x600. I then tried the VirtualBox various View menu settings and tried again in Ubuntu's System > Preferences > Monitors and I'm still stuck.\n\nA: I fixed the problem by doing:\n\n\n*\n\n*Turn off 3D Acceleration in the VB settings -- that's why the Guest Additions were locking up after login.\n\n*Run this in the terminal of your ubuntu virtual machine, not the host OS: \napt-get update  \napt-get upgrade  \napt-get install dkms  \napt-get install build-essential\n\n\n*Go to the Devices menu and tell it to install the Guest Additions. A new CDROM will appear on the desktop. Rightclick and choose the Autorun.\n\n*Restart the VM.\n\n*Now resize the VM window or choose Full Screen mode and it will resize the desktop screen resolution properly.\n\n", "Q: pulseaudio no sound card mplayer ok I'm running version 12.10. My PC has an built-in sound card and 3 usb sound cards of the same type. mplayer works ok for all of them using the argument -ao alsa:device=hw=2.0 for instance. vlc --aout=hw=2.0 does not work. pacmd does not list any card.

I want to use echo cancellation for my Skype calls and Empathy on Ubuntu 12.10 (pulseaudio 2.1). \nDoes anyone know how to do that?\n\nA: Skype handles echo itself, so this is not handled by PulseAudio. Empathy has a tick-box in preferences to enable echo cancellation, which will then make it tell PulseAudio to take the appropriate steps to enable AEC. Ideally, things should just work out of the box.\nBy default, PulseAudio will try to use the webrtc canceller which is pretty good. Unfortunately the 12.10 pulseaudio package does not use this. It will use the speex canceller which is reasonably good. I believe that enabling support for the webrtc engine is something being considered for the next Ubuntu release.\n", "Q: How can I make peristent changes on a USB ubuntu install? Here's what I've tried with no success:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unetbootin: It keeps hanging.\n\n*Linux Live USB: I only get an empty folder as the result\n\n*Universal installer: it hasn't worked.\n\n\nCan I use my Ubunu CD-ROM in persistent mode?\n\nA: You cannot do this with a LiveCD\nCDs, for the most part, are designed to be read-only once they've been written to. Even rewritable CDs typically require CD writing software, because most other applications will see the disk as a standard CD and assume it's read-only. This means that you cannot save your printer setup to the LiveCD.\nYou can install Ubuntu to a USB thumb drive\nIt's actually deceptively easy - take a standard live CD and boot to it with your USB drive plugged in, and install Ubuntu to the USB drive like you would to any other hard drive (be sure that everything points to the USB drive). You can then boot to it by selecting the USB drive in the boot device selection menu when your computer boots up. This method does format the drive to Ext4, so Windows can no longer read it, but it makes the entire drive available to the Ubuntu install, just as though it were on a regular hard drive.\nYour printer driver issues aren't all related to your LiveCD issues\nA 500 error is an error coming from the server that Ubuntu is trying to download from. It means that something is wrong with the server itself. There's nothing you can do about that error from that download mirror for that particular driver, except wait a while (anywhere from a few minutes to a couple of days) and see if it comes back. However, the LaserJet 1000 series is old enough that you should have a generic driver option available, which should allow you to install it. If that option isn't available, or doesn't work, then simply download it directly from the HPLIP website (it also includes instructions on installing it manually).\nSaving the settings, of course, will require a writable medium, which I've addressed above.\n\nA: You need to create a Live USB for persistence as live CD cannot store your settings and data.\nAnd for this you can simply use Ubuntu's own Startup Disk Creator or MultiSystem.\n", "Q: Vista/Ubuntu install problem I was trying to decide on installing Ubuntu along with my windows vista.  I copied the install files to my windows and installed from there.  Everything seem to go okay and I assumed that Ubuntu install created another partition for me, but I'm not sure.  Anyway, Ubuntu started up nice and runs nice, but when I booted to Ubuntu, I found that I lost my authentication. \nIs there a way to restore that without going through Microsoft?\n\nA: What do you mean by authentication?\nA brief summary of the installation process should clarify what has happened and how to enter your username and password.\nNormally you install from the live CD you created in Windows or whatever OS you started out with. To install you boot the live CD and--assuming you want to keep your other OS and files--tell it to install alongside other operating systems.\nAlternatively, you might run the Wubi installer, which installs Ubuntu to a disk image file inside the existing Windows partition. This also keeps the Windows system.\nI'm not sure which way you insatlled. But either way, during installation, it asks you to create a username and password, copies files, and restarts. You then get a boot menu where you can select between Ubuntu and Windows. To use Ubuntu, select it, and once it has booted, type in the  user name and password your gave it when you set it up.\nIf you don't remember the username and password you put in when you installed, or if the username and password you installed with are not working, then we'll need to know whether you booted from a CD/DVD/USB to install Ubuntu or installed Ubuntu inside Windows with Wubi--the way you'd fix it will be different in each case.\nIf the problem is that your username and password are now rejected when you try to log on to your Windows system, that's very strange, and you should provide a more detailed description of exactly what you're seeing. If this was triggered by installing Ubuntu, that's quite unusual.\n", "Q: I am trying to Run Ubuntu 12.10 alongside windows 7 and need some help with partitioning my HD PROPERLY! Ok so here is the problem, last night i burned a ubuntu 12.10 on a disc, GREAT! bootable ubuntu disc, however i am aware that i need to make some partitions in my HD to accomidate this in order to dual boot, however in my disc manager on both windows and ubuntu I have 4 partitions already on my disc Drive they are labeled as follows \nWindows7_OS(c:) NTFS (system boot,page file,ACtive,CrASH dump, Primary partition) 262.81 gb capacity , 174.29 gb free space\nLENOVO (D:) NTFS (Primary Partition) 25.47 gb capactity, 21.79 gb free space\n(E:) NTFS  ( primary partition) 200mb capactity, 165 mb free space\nunlabeled  (OEM partition ) 19.53gb capactity, 9.53 gb free space \n\nLastnight i made an error and tried partitioning my harddrive in ububntu and windows would not boot so i had to go and undo my partition(s) that i made off the windows 7 parition and everything worked fine again, now i boot windows go into disc management and shrunk my windows partiton to the size it is now in windows and i now have 363.05 gb Unallocated disc space available, how do i use this space when i already have 4 partitions and how do i partition properly so i dont loose windows in the process, my ubuntu will not give me the install option alongside windows, just the advanced option and completely errasing windows and installing ubuntu, any help please, i am a noob in this dept and dont want to wreck my rather new computer.... thank you anyone who can help!!\n\nA: first important step:\nUSE WINDOWS 7 to resize the partition smaller from which you will take a \"bite\" to install ubuntu on.\nso like I had reduced my Windows C partition for 20 GB (unformatted).\nThen boot into Ubuntu and it will automatically take this space to install it into.\nI had not to choose.\nWhile you can of course use the manual way to have extra partition for /home or so, it is not necessary.\n\nA: I've also found that reducing the size of Windows 7 partition by using its own Disk Management tool to make room for Ubuntu prevents possible booting problems for Windows 7.\nAfter having a smaller Windows 7 partition that boots without any problem, you have to (at least temporarily) delete one of you existing primary partitions and create a new EXTENDED partition under which you can then create many more LOGICAl partitions. For example, you can MOVE your existing DATA in drive D: (LENOVO) to somewhere else for this purpose.\nYou can then create a 20GB partition for Ubuntu installation, a 4GB partition for Linux-Swap, and use the rest of the space for the previous drive D.\n", "Q: Disable laptop touchpad when wacom tablet is plugged?

Instead I installed Ubuntu into a VirtualBox virtual machine which was a much easier operation, description here.\nI believe you can expect a performance hit of about 10% for running in a virtual machine but I was happy to accept that.\n", "Q: Why cannot install Lubuntu 12.10 on an extended partition? This is about an older computer (Toshiba Satellite M70 that a friend wants to keep afloat) on which (beside Win XP) was installed the Xubuntu 11.10 system that would not work for some reason: now the idea would be to format/repartition the non-windows space and to install Lubuntu 12.10.\nBut the installation procedure stops indefinitely immediately after setting the internet connection: \n\nafter \"Continue\" it would just lag. Renouncing to use an internet connection has the same results. \nThis computer does not support USB-boot so I have to use the live cd. Gparted shows the following configuration:\n \nI see that the previous installation was on an extended partition. A very useful answer that I have received here said that a system should not be on an extended partition. \nIs this the cause why the installation stops?\n(My idea is to use a live GParted cd to format and repartition the space according to the answer above - create two primary partitions and select mount point as / and /home.) \nComputer specs: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1528395/\nEdit/Update: In gparted live environment was able to delete one by one the swap and the ext4 partition and afterwards the extended partition. But the same problem happened, even after trying a different cd with a different iso, Lubuntu 12.04: until in this case I have renounced connecting to the internet - see my answer\n\nA: I am afraid, the answer you received is, strictly speaking, incorrect. An extended partition is just a container that holds logical partitions. You can't install anything on it, even if you wanted to. Primary and logical partitions are used to install OSs, so, in your case, Lubuntu can be installed either to the primary /dev/sda1 or the logical /dev/sda6, though, obviously, you'll have to let the installer format it.\nPS: Can you post the hardware specs of the machine.\n\nA: What I would try is to choose the something else option in the installer, then in gparted, I would format /dev/sda6 and set it as mount point /.\nThe previous attempt of installing Xubuntu might be interfering with the new installation.\nThis said, I suspect that the issue might by another one, but it's worth giving a try.\nOn other possible problem is too little RAM for the normal installer. So I would try the alternate install CD which needs less RAM.\nOn the other hand, if you do not want to loose Windows XP, do not touch partition /dev/sda1.\n\nA: Although you should be able to install Lubuntu on extended/logical partition, it might still be a good idea to unmount linux-swap partition, delete the extended/logical partition(s) and create instead 2 primary partitions for linux-swap and Lubuntu, and then try installation again.\nHowever, your installation problem may also be caused by some problem in your live CD or by the fact that the computer in question does not meet the system requirements to install Lubuntu 12.10.\n\nA: Trying to install from a different cd (Lubuntu 12.04 Desktop) it stopped at the same step but after renouncing the internet connection the installation procedure was able to continue - including creating new swap and primary partitions: system (/) and home (/home). \nThanks everybody for their quick responses. I do not know what the cause was and now i do not think it could be found.\nIt should be closed I guess but kept accessible for possible similar occurrence..\n", "Q: I need to convert ext2 filesystem to ext4 to prevent fsck every time I boot? Installed Ubuntu 12.10 alongside manufacturer-installed Win 8 with no problems. Was \"clever\" enough to install as ext2 filesystem, which has resulted in the inconvenience of fsck making the usual checks every time I boot up. Sure, I could just press \"C\" to cancel the check, but that gets a little old after a while.\nI've already tried tinkering with the maximum mount count in tune2fs, but that hasn't made any difference. It looks like I have to convert my ext2 filesystem to ext4. I could do this via the information provided here but have also noticed that I can enable some of the features of ext4, as detailed in this answer, by running the following command...\nsudo tune2fs -O has_journal,uninit_bg,extents /dev/sda1\n\n...and rebooting.\nIs it necessary to do the full filesystem conversion, or will the fsck be eliminated by running the above command in terminal to enable some ext4 features?\n\nA: You'll have to do that from a live environment (launch from a Ubuntu DVD or pendrive). Before doing so, please check the filesystem:\nsudo fsck.ext2 /dev/sda1\n\nAnd then do your thing. You better also enable dir_index. You can read about ext4 features on Wikipedia. Do it:\nsudo tune2fs -O dir_index,has_journal,uninit_bg,extents /dev/sda1\n\nAfter doing that, try mounting the filesystem to see if everything is OK.\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt -t ext4\n\nCan you see the filesystem? Nice.\nsudo ls /mnt\n\nAnd that's enough to convert the filesystem. But you'll also need to change the file /etc/fstab for the operating system to mount the filesystem as ext4.\nsudo gedit /mnt/etc/fstab\n\nChange the second line to say ext4 instead of ext2:\n# / was on /dev/sda1 during installation\nUUID=14f577b8-xxxx-4124-88d3-c1d49eb41113 /               ext2    errors=remount-ro 0       1\n\nAnd that's it.

This will reinstall Grub and you'll be able to boot Windows and Ubuntu with Grub again.\n\n*If you do not want to install Ubuntu again, then repair your MBR, practically removing Grub and restoring the Windows bootloader.

I wish to get rid of the windows 8 rubbish completely and re-install 12.04 from scratch and re-partition my hard disk at the same time to provide a single partition. Will this happen automatically when I re-install or should I re-partition the disk prior to install?\nThanks Stuart\n\nA: Select the second option at the 'Installation Type' screen, as shown in the picture, and then click contunue. It's not exactly automatic, whatever you mean by that, but seems to be the closest thing to whant you want.\n12.04 installation\nPS: Backup all important data, as it will be deleted.\n\nA: When installing Ubuntu, during the partition setup, choose use entire disk. It will wipe all the disk and create all the necessary partitions for you. As you are using a laptop and the chances of being stolen is high, I suggest you to encrypt you home folder. This option is available during the setup as well.\n", "Q: Is there any driver (64bit) available for Canon LBP6020B? I've have an i-Sensys LBP 6020B printer and I use Kubuntu 12.10 64-bit. I've a problem with drivers for Linux 64bit because I can't find anywhere capt linux driver - PPD file for LBP6020B. What am I supposed to do? My printer doesn't print.\n\nA: After several months of having problems with printers, because we migrated from Windows to Linux in our company which have more than 200 computers... now we found the driver which works on all our printers. The driver is ljet4 , just found some similar model of printer with ljet4 sufix on name and it will work. I wrote more on my blog : http://linuxibos.blogspot.com/2013/01/driver-that-works-on-allmost-all.html\nWe didn't try on your model but every similar model we have worked very well.\n\nA: Link1 Link2 Link3\nI'm using Kubuntu 14.10. I tried to automatically start ccpd on startup as described in links. But it doesn't work always. So I need to run these commands before printing.\n$sudo service ccpd start\n$sudo service ccpd status\n\nFollowing are some quotes from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CanonCaptDrv190\n\n1)  Configuring CUPS System->Administration->Printing add printer.\n  Choose \"Add printer\". Do not choose USB Printer found by Ubuntu here.\n  Select \"CAPT Printer\". You should see \"ccp\" in URI. Change it so URI\n  should become \"ccp://var/ccpd/fifo0\". Click \"next\", find your model\n  and add your printer. Choose English variant if you see Japanese and\n  English variants. Also If you do not have you exact model in list,\n  choose nearest. For example, for LBP 810, I choose \"LBP 1120\".\nTo look for available models you may use command:\n$ find /usr/share/cups/model -name 'LBPK.ppd' Close configuration\n  dialog, open again and rename your printer to, say, \"LBP6020\".\n  Remember name you chose, as later commands will refer to it.\nInstead of GUI actions, you may try this:\nsudo /usr/sbin/lpadmin -p LBP6020 -m CNCUPSLBP6020CAPTK.ppd -v\n  ccp://var/ccpd/fifo0 -E Again, choose another .ppd name, if you have\n  another printer...\n2) 64-bit Systems Canon CAPT Printer Driver for 64-bit architecture\n  include the proprietary closed-source 32-bit executable captfilter\n  (called by pstocapt CUPS filter, used to convert PostScript data to\n  CAPT data stream) which depends on 32-bit libraries libc6 and\n  libpopt0.

How come I don't see this screen?\n\nA: When I tried this a month ago, on an iMac G5, I found that the 12.10 iso and my graphics driver wouldn't let me get to the try/live desktop - or if it did, with no hardware acceleration, the colours on screen were posterised and practically unusable. I found two solutions, one of which you'll probably like, one you won't:\nFirst, (and this worked for me) you could try downloading the alternate PPC install iso and running from that. It allows you to install using the non-graphical installer, with a debian/DOS-like interface. Once installed, you should be able to boot up into the OS, but will need to tweak any parts that don't function correctly. In my case sound, wifi and graphics. The solutions are out there and are google-able. I settled with a 98% perfect install, just having to disable the hardware acceleration in yaboot every time I boot. For a glorified word processor and email client that's fine, but for youtube, DVDs and flash its game over.\nSecond, you could try downloading the 12.04 version and running the older installer. That one worked fine for me using the graphical try/live desktop. Once installed, you could try updating the whole operating system to 12.10 if you wish, using \"sudo do-release-upgrade\" but a word of caution: when I tried using this technique, the nouveau graphic package got corrupted, so I had to start from scratch.\n", "Q: How to put focus on the menu toolbar? In windows machine I am used to tap the Alt key and I have normally focus on the menu toolbars, like \"File\", \"Edit\", \"View\" and so on. Is there any equivalent for Ubuntu? Because, right now, if I hit the Alt key I get the \"type your command\" option.\n\nA: I don't use the HUD that much, so I changed its shortcut to Alt+z and now Alt focuses the menu bar.  \n1: Open \"System Settings\"\n2: Navigate to \"Keyboard\" and switch to the \"Shortcuts\" tab.  \n3: Under \"Launchers\" in the left column will be \"Key to Show the HUD\"  \n4: Click on \"Alt\" in the other end of the row and press the key you want to use instead.  (In my case Alt+z)  \n\nThis will actually set all Alt based shortcuts to what they would normally be, for example Alt+d focuses the address bar.\n\nA: Because Unity works differently from Windows, the equivalent in Ubuntu is press alt to open the dash and then start typing the menu name that you want.\nIt is very useful if you just remember the menu item but not the parent menu that the item belongs to.\n\nA: Hold down Alt for about a second to make the the menu bar become visible. Then press the keyboard button with the same letter as is underlined (mnemonic) of the word in the menu bar you want to open.\n", "Q: How to transfer files between Android and Ubuntu? I have an Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S3) and I wish to take the music files I have off of it and store them on my laptop which is running Ubuntu 12.10. Upon connecting my phone to my computer I can see the phone but if I try to open it to view it's contents I receive an error saying that my device was not mounted. Is there any quick fix which will allow me to take music and other files from my phone to store them on my computer?\n\nA: I gave up trying to get MTP support on Linux for the moment.\nHere is the solution I use now:\n\n\n*\n\n*On your Android device, install FTP Server (it's free and open source)\n\n*On your Ubuntu computer, install Filezilla\n\n*Make sure both your computer and your Android device are connected to the same WiFi network\n\n*On Android, launch FTP Server, and check \"Running\". It will provide you an IP and a port.\n\n*In Filezilla, connect to yoru Android device using these information, and ftp/ftp as login/password (you can change this in FTP Server if you want)\n\n*You can then navigate into your device from your Ubuntu computer! I usually use this to transfer music on my Android Samsung Galaxy S3 (I put it in /storage/extSdCard/ directory)\n\n\nA: This android version uses MTP (Multimedia Transfer Protocol) and PTP (Picture Transfer Protocol). Ubuntu doesn't come with MTP support installed. Install gMTP and you can transfer the files.\n", "Q: Help with /etc/fstab I am trying to set up a nginx server on Ubuntu server 12.10 following this tutorial and there is a section(16) about \"/etc/fstab\" that says:\n\nEdit /etc/fstab.

running a HP Pavilion DV6000 and I forgot to mention I'd prefer being able to run a command without needing root access if possible.\nAs for using xdotool it changes the stated brightness here: \n \nBut the screen remains at the current brightness so doesn't affect the hardware related to brightness in my case.\n\nA: You can probably use the xbacklight tool, which doesn't require root permissions:\nxbacklight +30%        # increases brightness by 30 percent\nxbacklight -30%        # decreases brightness by 30 percent\n\nSee man xbacklight for all the available options. Of course, if you don't have xbacklight you need to install it:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xbacklight\n\n\nA: You have to do it with superuser privileges, on my system it refused to grant access for sudoer so I did it by first changing the user to su by running sudo su and then performed those commands.   \nTo find out the maximum level of brightness for screen run:\ncat /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/max_brightness\n\nThat should print 7 or whatever in your case, this is the maximum level you can increase the brightness upto, now to change the brightness run\necho \"5\" >> /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness\n\nbasically changing \"5\" from 1-7 will increase or decrease the brightness.\nNote: For those who get No Such File or directory executing the above commands will have replace acpi_video0 with other options available. To get a list of all available try this command:\nls /sys/class/backlight/\n\nand then try the echo and cat commands with whatever you get by ls\n\nA: TEST IT\nCreate a file in your home directory called .xmodmap:  touch .xmodmap\nThen open the file to edit the contents: gedit .xmodmap\nAdd these lines: \n!Make the F7 key brightness down\nkeycode  73 = XF86MonBrightnessDown NoSymbol XF86MonBrightnessDown\n!Make the F8 key brightness up  \nkeycode  74 = XF86MonBrightnessUp NoSymbol XF86MonBrightnessUp  \n\nSave the file then run xmodmap .xmodmap.  If the keys now do what you want, continue.  If not delete the .xmodmap file from your home.  \nCONTINUED \nOpen startup applications from the dash.  Click \"Add\".  Put xmodmap .xmodmap in the command field.  The other fields are optional, you can leave them blank.  Click \"Add\" again.  This makes Xmodmap run at startup.\n\n\nA: There is a brightness indicator that you can dowload http://codevanrohde.nl/wordpress/?p=128. It is the only solution I have found that works on my laptop. With it you can set up hot keys to control brightness, use your mousewheel or select from a drop down list in the indicator. I have replaced 'Fn' with 'Win+Alt' which is very similar for my hands and now I can also use it with an external keyboard!\nTo add PPA and install:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:indicator-brightness/ppa\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install indicator-brightness\n\nHot keys should be assigned to:\n/opt/extras.ubuntu.com/indicator-brightness/indicator-brightness-adjust --up\n\nand\n/opt/extras.ubuntu.com/indicator-brightness/indicator-brightness-adjust --down\n\n\nA: If xbacklight fails and keyboard shortcuts(eg:fn+F4) changes the brightness following method should work.   \ndbus way \ndbus-send --session --print-reply --dest=\"org.gnome.SettingsDaemon\" /org/gnome/SettingsDaemon/Power org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Power.Screen.SetPercentage uint32:`percentage` \n\nFor Example: Set brightness to 30%  \ndbus-send --session --print-reply --dest=\"org.gnome.SettingsDaemon\" /org/gnome/SettingsDaemon/Power org.gnome.SettingsDaemon.Power.Screen.SetPercentage uint32:30  \n\nIf it says as follows your OS may too old.

On my home stereo I have a spectrograph that has a 2D matrix, whereby the X axis is the frequency (deep bass on the left, vocals in the center, treble on the right), and the Y axis is the volume or power of the sound at that frequency.

I think something is wrong, because as you can see in the image below, I already selected the settings to do nothing when I close the lid, but is not working.\nAny idea how can I fix this?\n\n\nA: Perhaps it is a option in your BIOS.\nTo see if this is the case you should reboot your laptop. As soon as you see any text on the screen you should press either F1, F6 or F10 (it varies from laptop to laptop, but often is says something like \"Press F1 for Options\" when the laptop is booting. Then you will enter the BIOS control center. \nFrom there you will most likely have a lot of configuration options, and they all look different depending on which laptop you are using, so unfortunately I can't give specific instructions however a such option as \"Behavior when lid is closed\" is probably going to be under \"Power\" or \"Display\".\n", "Q: How can I move Steam's download folder?

I am only presented with the option to erase the disk and install so the install alongside windows option does not appear.\nHow can I install Ubuntu without erase my Windows system?\n\nA: It is possible that the Ubuntu installer is not recognizing Windows 8 because of GPT partitions. Below are some links that helped me.\nLinks:\nWhy is Windows 8 invisible on Ubuntu 12.10's installer?\nZapping GPT Data Structures\nNote: The second link asks for gdisk. I was unable to download gdisk via terminal. I had to go through firefox and get the .deb file, which took me to ubuntu's software center. Here is the link to get the .deb file: GPT fdisk gdisk\nHope this helps!\n\nA: In your case, the only way to avoid erasing Windows is to choose Something Else at the Installation type step of the Ubuntu install.\n\nA: Well, this happened to me too. You don't really need the ubuntu installer to recognize the windows in order to dual boot.\nWhat I did was to wipe off the windows efi partition (system reseved files) that was somehow formatted in ntfs and format it with FAT and install ubuntu on a separate partition using this new FAT efi partition.\nThen load the windows recovery cd, and manually add on the efi partition, by using the command prompt, the windows boot files. Here is a guide on how to do that: https://superuser.com/a/504360 \nProcedure pretty much amounts to pointing where your windows partition is, mounting the EFI partition, and running bcdboot to create the bcd boon on EFI in microsoft's folder.\nThen to make sure when you reboot into ubuntu to install boot-repair it will fix most GRUB and boot errors.\n...or try to play around with GPT partitioning like the other answer indicated. It's fairly tedious IMO, but hey, this is Linux. :)\nBest of luck!\n\nA: I agree with: The something else option\nThat way you can configure the install exactly as required.\nMake sure you backup.\nRemember too that by default Windows 8 doesn't actually shutdown properly, you need to change some settings to make sure it does. This is an important part of any setting up a dual boot.\n", "Q: How to install GCC 4.7 on Lubuntu 11.10? I installed Lubuntu 11.10 and I installed build-essential with this command:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nNow I have gcc 4.6\nI read on some forum that adding the next PPA I'll be able to install gcc 4.7:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test\n\nI did that, then ran:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install gcc-4.7\n\nBut my machine can't find the gcc-4.7 package? Any suggestion?\n\nA: ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test is the wrong PPA unless your aim is to test new, experimental packages that might be vastly unstable. Furthermore, since that PPA is just a sandbox for testing, there's no particular package that's ever necessarily in there. Packages come and go.\n\n*\n\n*At the time of this posting, the only package that PPA provides for Oneiric (11.10) is libatomic-ops.\n\nIf you want to install PPA-provided toolchain builds, for any purpose except testing new toolchain-r packages, the \"toolchain-r\" team provides this repository:\n\n*\n\n*ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/ppa\nHowever, that does not provide gcc-4.7 on Oneiric. It provides it for Quantal, but not Oneiric.\n\n*\n\n*These instructions, which you may have been working from, worked for Precise, may once have worked for Oneiric (though comments suggest otherwise), but that PPA does not currently provide a gcc-4.7 package for 11.10. See this related question.)\n\nSearching for another PPA on Launchpad didn't reveal anything for me. You might be able to install a package intended for another release (or for Debian), but especially with a compiler suite, this runs the risk of not working...or not working entirely, such that you might not discover the problem until much later.\nInstalling the Upstream Version\nYour best bet might be to install an upstream GCC 4.7. You can download and install it from any GCC mirror. For example, you can get GCC 4.7.2 here.\nBootstrapping/building GCC from upstream sources is somewhat time consuming and slightly more involved than building most software from source, but it's not too difficult. Check out the documentation that comes in the source archive. Most problems have solutions and you can search for them. Feel free to post questions here if you have trouble!\n\n*\n\n*This might be helpful (as sroecker suggested here).\n\ndebootstrap\nAlternatively, you may wish to create a full directory structure for a minimal Ubuntu system of a later version that has GCC 5.7, like 12.10 Quantal. debootstrap facilitates this.

I have a Lenovo X220 with Intel HD 3000 on-board chip.\nWhen I have in the Screen and Brightness Setting \"save energy\" option activated\nthe screen wil lower the brightness very strongly after just few SECONDs of non-typing.\nthis is very unhandy.\nEspecially if an application is running, like a video is showing in the browser.\nis there no more detailed way of controlling screen brightness?\n\nA: Original Answer \n     I did some research and figured out how you can adjust the \"idle\" time of your computer. Basically this way you can adjust it so that the computer doesn't ever dim the display or adjust how long it takes before the display dims.\n     You will need dconf tools, and to be on the safe side you should make sure all your packages are updated first.\n     So in your terminal type:\n sudo apt-get update\n\n     Then install dconf-tools:\nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\n     Once that is finished, in the terminal type the following to launch the program:\ndconf-editor\n\n     You should see an expandable list on the left hand side of this new window use them to navigate the following path: \norg > gnome > settings-daemon > plugins > power\nOnce you've clicked power you should get a list of options on the right hand side of the window. Scrolll to find \"idle-dim-battery\" and uncheck the box. This will completely prevent the screen from dimming while on battery. OR if you'd prefer, find \"idle-dim-time\" and change the value in seconds.\n     Hope this helps with the dimming problem. \n     Next, for video watching you can use a program called caffeine:\n sudo add-apt-repository ppa:caffeine-developers/ppa\n\nthen,\n sudo app-get update\n\nfinally:\n sudo apt-get install caffeine python-glade2\n\n\n     Lastly for power saving there are a lot of different options, I personally installed and use Jupiter, Laptop mode tools, and Powertop.\n\n     Best of luck and I hope this helps.\n\nWorkaround / Updated Answer \n     Should dconf not work, you can also try adjusting these settings using the terminal command \"gsettings\". This accomplishes the exact same thing as Dconf editor except without the graphical user interface (GUI).\n\n     To entirely turn off the automatic dim on battery, copy and paste the following into your terminal:\n gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power idle-dim-battery false\n\nor to instead set a time in seconds until the computer automatically dims the screen enter the following and replace \"X\" with the number of seconds (i.e. 90 or 200 etc.)\n gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power idle-dim-time X\n\n     Where, again, \"X\" is the number in seconds.\n     I personally tried these commands in my terminal and they did work. I still highly recommend using dconf editor as above and navigating to the same power options to verify that the changes did in fact take place. \nHope this works!\n", "Q: Enable Sync to VBlank on LXDE with Intel Video Card How can I enable Sync To VBlank in LXDE?

I am using a Intel processor with AMD64 so it should work just fine.\nMy understanding is that AMD developed 64 bit first and got the right to call it \"AMD64\", so its all 64 bit and will work with your processor.\n\nA: Yes, you can run the AMD64 image on any 64-bit compatible processor, despite the vendor (Intel, AMD, etc.)\nThe AMD64 is simply a naming convention for disk architectures (e.g. 32-bit or 64-bit).\ni386 is another example of this, it means that a processor has the x86 architecture.\nProcessor architecture is vendor-independent, so you can use programs compiled with an Intel processor on an AMD machine, and vice versa.\n", "Q: How do I make it so that the spread comes up on one click?

I need to fix my bad sectors \nfsck /dev/sdb  \nfsck from util-linux 2.20.1  \ne2fsck 1.42.5 (29-Jul-2012)  \nfsck.ext2: Permission denied while trying to open /dev/sdb  \nYou must have r/w access to the filesystem or be root  \n\n\nA: A bad sector on a drive is a sign of permanent damage to the drive.  Unless you have reason to believe that your drive marked these sectors as bad incorrectly, you cannot \"fix\" them.\nIt means that a part of your drive is damaged to the extent that it can no longer reliably be read from and/or written to.\nYour system can continue to use the drive by marking that sector as unusable, but if you have enough bad sectors, or a SMART tool triggers a warning level, you might consider a drive replacement, as bad sectors can be a sign that more sectors, or the whole drive, might fail soon.\nWhile there may be ways to force the drive to un-mark a sector as bad, allowing you to use it again, this is likely not a good idea.  The sector may stay good, but it will just as likely become bad again.  Some data may be lost or corrupted depending on how it fails.\nNow, as for the error message you've pasted in your question (as of my writing this), that error has nothing to do with bad sectors.  It means that you don't have access to the drive.  Being sudo can give you access, so:\nsudo fsck /dev/sdb\n\nHowever, this is still probably not what you want, because /dev/sdb refers to the entire drive, whereas fsck is designed to work on filesystems, which are usually (but not always, and you may have an exception here) placed in partitions.  If the above didn't work, you may instead have wanted to do this to the 1st partition on that drive:\nsudo fsck /dev/sdb1\n\nYou can get a list of partitions per drive with:\nsudo fdisk -l\n\n\nA: In short: Boot a rescue system and use badblocks:\nbadblocks -svn /dev/sda\n\nto have the hard disk controller replace bad blocks by spare blocks.\nI have answered the same question in detail here.\n\nA: In the olden days you used to have to take a note of the badblocks that were written on the drive and enter those in the defect list before formatting the drive, because hard disk surfaces were never \"perfect\", manufacturer's got wise to this because people buying disks would look at the defect table printed on the disk and buy the ones with the least amount of defects...\nNow scroll forward 20 or so years and hard disk manufacturers hide the fact a brand new disk has bad blocks with the firmware, when you buy a brand new disk it will have in all probability bad blocks already, the firmware will detect newly grown badblocks and maps them out from a set of spare cylinders it has, but this only happens when a write operation occurs on that sector and the ECC algorithm detects bit failure, only then will it map the block out. So getting back to the point you can force a drive to map out the badblocks by simply using DD, ie/  [edit: following example was edited to prevent accidental drive destruction: removed wildcard character, replaced with X].\nWARNING: DO NOT BLINDLY USE THE dd COMMAND BELOW IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT DOES.\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=1M \n\nobviously alter the of=target to reflect the drive you want to zero\nthis is the quickest way to re-map a drives defects, its also the quickest way to totally trash your Linux setup by getting the target drive wrong, so check, double check then check again, before you press the enter key. You can increase the size of the blocksize in the dd command to optimize read/writes and perhaps make things go quicker, but there are diminishing returns after a point. I find anything between 1M and 8M works best for me\nYou can get DD to just write one sector, the bad one... to get it remapped, so you don't have to backup your drive, but that's a whole different kettle of fish and Russian roulette if you don't know exactly what you're doing .....\nThis command WILL destroy everything on your hard drive including any partitions. But it will force the drive to map out any bad sectors it may have.\nIt is perfectly ok for a disk to have bad sectors as long as they aren't on the boot sector, if they are then the drive is useless, if you notice a few months later that your drive has developed more bad sectors then it's time to start shopping for a replacement.\nI've revived hundreds of drives like this and they've lived on for many years afterwards, a bad sector isn't necessarily the death knell for the drive.\n\nA: After \"man badblocks\" and \"man e2fsck\" I found:\nYou probably do not want to run badblocks as a standalone but with e2fsck.\nTo run e2fsck with badblocks add the -c option.\n\"This option causes e2fsck to use badblocks program to do a read-only scan of the device in order  to  find  any  bad blocks. If  any bad blocks are found, they are added to the bad block inode to prevent them from being allocated to a              file or directory.\"\nYou can also add -k to add to the bad block list and not create a new one.\nsudo e2fsck -ck /dev/sda1\n", "Q: Xubuntu 12.10 cannot archive folder on desktop When I right click a folder on the desktop, there's no option to archive it. I actually have to open up the Thunar file manager, navigate to the desktop folder, and right click on the folder in order to archive it. Why can't I archive directly from the desktop?\n\nA: thunar-archive-plugin\nDo you have a default archive manager installed and set to correctly archive?  \n \nThe standard MIME association mechanism is used to determine the preferred archive manager for the Create Archive…, Extract Here and Extract To… actions. However the plugin may not always be able to detect the appropriate archive manager for a certain task.

I've typically ran PS3 Media Server for a few years now to serve and transcode Video to multiple devices. It's great at transcoding videos for each device specifically.\nIn my experience, PS3 Media Server isn't a great daemon. I've seen web pages that show how to configure it as a daemon but I've ran into nothing but problems while trying to run it headless. \nIt's also very inefficient in some circumstances. For example, there are times where only the Audio within a Video needs converted and can be done within several seconds on the same computer from the command line for the entire video. (Possibly irrelevant depending on how transcoding is implemented)\nSome devices that I serve video to include the XBox 360, Playstation 3, and a TV. My videos are stored in many different formats and use various encodings. \nWhat are some good alternatives to the PS3 Media Server that can be ran as a daemon?\n\nA: Rygel\nI mainly stream media to my Xbox360. I came accross the Rygel project, which I haven't had any issues with.\n\nRygel is a home media solution (UPnP AV MediaServer) that allows you\n  to easily share audio, video and pictures to other devices.\nAdditionally, media player software may use Rygel to become a\n  MediaRenderer that may be controlled remotely by a UPnP or DLNA\n  Controller.\nRygel achieves interoperability with other devices in the market by\n  trying to conform to the very strict requirements of DLNA and by\n  converting media on-the-fly to formats that client devices can handle.\nMost Rygel functionality is implemented through a plug-in mechanism.\n\n\n\nUser Features\nThere are plenty of DLNA/UPnP devices already on the market, such as\n  the Sony Playstation 3, Nokia's series60 and Maemo-based phones, the\n  Microsoft XBox 360 (not a real UPnP device but we must support it due\n  to high demand), DLNA speakers, the Sony Bravia TV and some other DLNA\n  TVs from Sony and Samsung. Moreover, the number of DLNA devices in the\n  market is expected to grow. If a user has a PS3 or one of the DLNA\n  TVs, a laptop or desktop PC running GNOME, one of the DLNA speakers or\n  one of the next generation of Maemo Phone, she would like to:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*Browse her media collection on her PC (running GNOME) from her TV or\n  PS3 and be able to play any of her media. She should be able to play\n  it even if the original content is in a format that her TV or PS3 is\n  incapable of playing, so the Rygel media server should be able to\n  transcode on the fly. \n  \n*Easily search for the desired media using her\n  phone and to play it on the phone, her TV, or the PC, while retaining\n  full control over the playback from her phone. \n  \n*Before, or while\n  watching, a movie on her PC, use her phone to redirect the sound\n  output to her DLNA speakers.\n  \n\nYou can install it by running in terminal: sudo apt-get install rygel\nThe package rygel-preferences can be installed and used to specify which folders to stream (through a GUI).\nAfter installing, you run the server by running the rygel command.\n", "Q: Can I upgrade my 32-bit version of Ubuntu to 64-bit Ubuntu? For a while, I have been using a 32-bit version of Ubuntu, and I have been considering switching to the 64-bit version. Because I am not too familiar with the ins and outs of Ubuntu yet, I was wondering if it's possible to directly upgrade to the 64-bit version, or will I have to uninstall Ubuntu, and then re-install it?\n\nA: There is no convenient way to upgrade from 32-bit to 64-bit Ubuntu. You have to reinstall.\nIf you don't need the 64-bit version for some special reason then I'd suggest that you save yourself the trouble for now; stick with the 32-bit version until you have some other reason to reinstall, e.g., you acquire a new computer.\n\nA: You never uninstall an operating system, you simply reformat the partition and it's gone. If you want to do everything in one session, you pretty much can.\n\n\n*\n\n*Grab Ubuntu 64-bit\n\n*Boot it up in a live session\n\n*Back up everything to an external hard drive or really large USB key (ideal), alternatively run GParted and reduce your Ubuntu partition to minimal space, create a backup partition and copy over all your files, even your entire home directory if you like. You also have the option of migrating your home directory to its dedicated partition\n\n*Install Ubuntu 64 bit over the previous OS partition (reformat), if you created a backup partition, you can mount it to a specific folder like /media/backup/, then reboot\n\n*Then all your restore your files or just leave them in the backup partition (either on your hard drive or external storage)\n\n*Now you have 64 bit Ubuntu. Although you reinstalled the OS, especially if you keep your home directory on its dedicated partition, after reinstalling the apps you use, you'll hardly notice the fact that you reinstalled your OS!\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu does not detect my VAIO webcam I've installed Ubuntu 12.10.

Went to tweaks/fonts section of Ubuntu Tweak, and the names of the installed fonts appear but the example characters below the names are black-bordered white rectangles (NOT \"The quick brown...\" in the selected font).\nUninstalled from /usr/share/fonts, reinstalled in /home/.fonts, and the fonts worked again in LibreOffice.  Uninstalled from /home/.fonts, installed in /usr/share/fonts, not working again (this time used sudo fc-cache -rv).\nAdditionally, I downloaded a new font from the web and placed file in /usr/share/fonts.  After sudo fc-cache -f -v this new font shows up working normally in LibreOffice.  None of the others work, however, unless in /home/.fonts.\nLast try (as per WebbyIT)- tried sudo mv ~/.fonts/name.font /usr/share/fonts/ for all of the fonts.  They are now located in /usr/share/fonts and working on my administrator account.  However, they still don't work for any other accounts (standard or guest).\nAny ideas what the heck is going on???  I would still like to use these fonts globally.\n\nA: Use move in terminal to move your fonts:\nsudo mv ~/.fonts/name.font /usr/share/fonts/\n\nAfter, rebuild your cache:\nsudo fc-cache -f -v\n\n\nA: This was a permissions issue.  When following Emre & ZDroid's suggestions, found the permissions were at level 600 (-rw-------).  For all fonts, I used:\n\nchmod 644 fontname.ttf\n\nand now all users can use fonts.\nWhat probably happened is since I initially installed in /home/.fonts the permissions were set for admin-only usage, and even though I deleted them and reinstalled in /usr/share/fonts those permission levels were carried over.\n", "Q: Ubuntu virtual terminals hotkey problem This problem appears from at least 11.04 till at least 12.04.\nUsually if you want to open one of six virtual terminals, you press hotkeys Ctrl+Alt+F[1-6] (or Ctrl+Alt+F7 to go back to X).\nBut I have a problem on every build I've tested that virtual terminals which are opened with Alt+F[1-6] (Ctrl is not used). So if you want just to close an application (Alt+F4) or to open an \"Execute\" dialog (Alt+F2), you firstly get #4 or #2 virtual terminal and after that when you come back to #7 (X), the requested action is executed.\nThe only solution for now I've found by experiment is restarting the X user session. So every time I boot in Ubuntu, I have to re-login to cure this bug till my next boot.\nI've looked for solutions in the Internet, but my question formulations have been luring me to other problems, very far from mine.\nHardware info:\n\n\n  dmidecode 2.11\n  \n  SMBIOS 2.6 present.\n  63 structures occupying 2519 bytes.\n  Table at 0x000E0850.\n  \n  Handle 0x0000, DMI type 0, 24 bytes\n  BIOS

least, 12.04 which I'm using now). Well I can't explain everything in details, but the problem is the \"FRAMEBUFFER\" option which is missed in the initramfs settings.\nThe solution is:\nsudo vim /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf\n# append \"FRAMEBUFFER=Y\" to the end of this file\nsudo update-initramfs -u\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure console-setup\n# reboot your OS or type \"setupcon\" in the terminal\n...\nPROFIT!\n\nAlso this solution resolves the problem when cyrillic symbols aren't shown in the terminal but the squares are shown.\n\nA: There's not a lot of people out there talking about similar problems, but after a lot of Googling and learning more about X11 keyboard events and keyboard configurations, I think the problem is a combination of your hardware and the Russian keyboard. \nUsing xev to see key events, Ctrl+Alt+F1 as (shortened output): \nKeyPress event keycode 105 (keysym 0xffe4, Control_R), same_screen YES,\nKeyPress event keycode 108 (keysym 0xffea, Alt_R), same_screen YES,\nKeyRelease event keycode 67 (keysym 0x1008fe01, XF86Switch_VT_1), same_screen YES\n\nNote that keycode 67 (F1) -- when preceded by Ctrl+Alt -- is not mapped to the keysym F1 but to a keysym calledXF86XK_Switch_VT_1, which is defined in X11 as (decimal) 67.\nIn other words, your problem can be re-stated as: X doesn't see 67 (F1) after ctrl-alt as XF86XK_Switch_VT_1 until I logout and log back in.\nAt that point, I figured the solution should be to create an ~/.Xmodmap file to force the mapping on startup. You only need one line:\nkeycode 67 = F1 F1 F1 F1 F1 F1 XF86Switch_VT_1\n\nThe exact syntax was difficult, but now knowing to search for XF86XK_Switch_VT_1, I found two pages with the same problem (one mentioning an Italian keyboard) and both gave the syntax as above. (here and here).\nI'm reasonably confident this will solve your problem. You may need to add similar lines for F2-6.\n\nHere's what I think is happening:\nFor whatever reason, when X first starts, it is not able to correctly load the default keymap (usually /etc/X11/xkb/keycodes/evdev) where 67 is mapped to <FK01>. Keymapping errors do not cause X to fail, so you are able to log in. But the X way of switching to tty fails, allowing the key event to fall through to the non-X way switching method. When you re-login, again for whatever reason, X correctly loads the keymapping. \nWhy the one and not the other? I don't know, but I can guess it's related either to user settings for the keyboard layout, other mapping changes that may have caused conflicts, hardware (67 is not standard for F1 across manufacturers but 67 is defined for XF86Switch_VT_1 in XF86keysym.h, so if it doesn't get mapped correctly, switching won't work), or a combination of the two.  \n", "Q: Problem with updating due to obsolete package versions. I recently installed Ubuntu 12.04. When I started the update manager I received this message:  \nThe problem cannot be reported:\n\nYou have some obsolete package versions installed.

Thank you.\nDavid\n\nA: Open a terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo apt-get autoclean\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nSince autoclean removes packages that are no longer available from configured software sources, you may want to move the sudo apt-get autoclean step until right after the sudo apt-get update step. \n\n\n*\n\n*Clean: clean clears out the local repository of retrieved package\nfiles. It removes everything but the lock file from\n/var/cache/apt/archives/ and /var/cache/apt/archives/partial/. When\nAPT is used as a dselect method, clean is run automatically. Those\nwho do not use dselect will likely want to run apt-get clean from\ntime to time to free up disk space.\n\n*Autoclean: Like clean, autoclean clears out the local repository of\nretrieved package files. The difference is that it only removes\npackage files that can no longer be downloaded, and are largely\nuseless. This allows a cache to be maintained over a long period\nwithout it growing out of control. The configuration option\nAPT::Clean-Installed will prevent installed packages from being\nerased if it is set to off.\n\n*Autoremove: is used to remove packages that were automatically\ninstalled to satisfy dependencies for some package and that are no\nlonger needed.\nSee manpage\n", "Q: Where is '/etc/hosts' in XAMPP 1.7.7?

I was hit by an error and need help solving it. I posted this as an \"answer\" there and was advised to open a new question:\nSo, here is my problem. I'm running Kubuntu 12.04, and Windows 7 Ultimate. My mysqldata folder right now rest on a second hardrive, which is my Data drive shared between both installs This is the line for it on my fstab:\nUUID=9EEAD9BAEAD98F41                      /media/Data  ntfs-3g  defaults,windows_names,locale=en_US.utf8  0 0\n\nI tried adding uid=mysql,gid=mysql to the options line. A ls -la /media/Data shows that it indeed was mounted for the correct users and also the permissions were 777. Same goes for the /media/Data/Sistemas/mysqldata folder.

I can't even seem to find the Nouveau driver though.\nI didn't have this problem with my GTX570.\nI am looking for drivers since there is stutter going on in the desktop animations and Steam \"Big Picture\" mode results in just a black screen.\nI am running Ubuntu 12.10 with the latest version of GNOME + GDM login screen (this was also an issue with Unity, however).\nMy graphics card is an EVGA GTX660 Ti FTW+ (3 GB RAM) plugged into an ASRock Z77 Pro 3 motherboard. \nEDIT: I used the command:\n\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current nvidia-settings\n\nNow I have Nvidia x-server as an app in my list, but still saying I'm not running any proprietary drivers.\nAlso, I have two monitors, and when I set it to \"Mirror displays\" it dropped my resolution to 1024x768 (4:3) and wouldn't let me restore to my previous setting. Now I'm stuck with this annoying aspect ratio... (Before I ticked \"Mirror displays\" the resolution box already said 1024x768 (4:3) but it looked more like 1920x1080 (16:9)).\nEDIT 2: After a complete system lockup and reboot via reset button, Ubuntu won't even boot anymore. It just hangs at a purple screen that usually comes up just before login. This issue has forced me to reinstall several times in the last couple of days.

I try to download a file by axel but i got an error:\nHTTP/1.1 504 Connect to [URL]:80 failed: Connection refused\n\nIt's happen after I remove tor, how can i fix this?\n\nA: Axel has a configuration file. This sits either in $HOME/.axelrc or in /etc/axelrc. In this file the proxy is configured. Look for a line starting with http_proxy. The line probably reads http_proxy = http://127.0.0.1:8118. Remove  it or place a # in front of the line. Now axel 'forgets' about the proxy and uses a direct connection.\nIf you find no such setting there might also be a shell variable called http_proxy. Just open a terminal and type echo $http_proxy. If you see a valid proxy, axel will also try to use it. Just unset the variable and axel will also use a direct connection.\n", "Q: PXE Boot Broken after 12.04 Upgrade I had a system booting over the network with PXE on 11.10.

See the following screenshots:\n\n\nSo it seems these processes are unity related. Should I worry?\n\nA: Direct Short(er) Answer\nIs this a bug?\nProbably, the DBUS error is nothing, the hanging pxgsettings is either bad config or poorly written interface in some program that runs (and reads settings) frequently. If you can try down the cause you should submit a bug report.\nHas my computer been compromised?\nAlmost certainly not. Again the DBUS error is not ever really an error. It is technically a bug but not one that would effect anything. The hanging processes is likely a bug.\nMore Info\nIf someone did compromise your system the information they could get from pxgsettings would be rather pointless. I suppose there could be sensitive data there, but mostly it would be window positions, label names, color choices, etc. Nothing like passwords should be stored there. To rule out \"compromise\" you can always run users and see if there's more then just you running the system. If there is someone else on your system it will show there. You can also check top for ssh sessions or high running CPU/MEM programs that you didn't launch. Finally /var/log/auth.log will show all login attempts and successes (with some other data) if you still want to dawn your tin foil hat.  But truthfully all that is a bit overboard.\nLinks\nThis may help. Basically pxgsettings is \"A helper binary to query gsettings\".\nIt would appear that you have something quarring gsettings and crashing. GSettings is a High-level API for application settings. In short it looks like there is a process running every one in a while that hangs reading some settings from something. Unfortunately you don't have enough info to track down the process. It could be related to the program your trying to kill.\nI do not think it's related to Bluetooth. That Bluetooth message is normal. The Rejected message is from DBUS and not Bluetooth. In fact that error has almost nothing to do with Bluetooth.\n\nA: Do you use Tomboy?  \nIt appears to leave five zombie pxgsettings processes around every time a synchronization is done.\nIt may not be relevant but my machine is behind a proxy.\nKilling tomboy cleaned up all the pxgsettings instances.\n\nA: I am also tracking down why my system has 5 pxgsettings processes (each one spawned from a lingering 'sh' process) upon startup, and they seem to grow somewhat from there.

In 'pstree':\n |-gvfsd-http-+-sh---pxgsettings---2*[{pxgsettings}]\n |            `-3*[{gvfsd-http}]\n\n |-unity-lens-phot-+-sh---pxgsettings---2*[{pxgsettings}]\n |                 `-3*[{unity-lens-phot}]\n |-unity-scope-gdr-+-sh---pxgsettings---2*[{pxgsettings}]\n |                 `-3*[{unity-scope-gdr}]\n |-unity-scope-vid-+-sh---pxgsettings---2*[{pxgsettings}]\n |                 `-2*[{unity-scope-vid}]\n |-unity-shopping--+-sh---pxgsettings---2*[{pxgsettings}]\n |                 `-2*[{unity-shopping-}]\n\nThey all bear the stamp of org.gnome.system.proxy in the full command.  Here I pasted one full command through strace and it produces normal output and completes normally. \n[Linux2:~]$ strace /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libproxy/0.4.7/pxgsettings org.gnome.system.proxy org.gnome.system.proxy.http org.gnome.system.proxy.https org.gnome.system.proxy.ftp org.gnome.system.proxy.socks\n\nSo I don't know why those pxgsettings processes linger.  It does look like a bug, to me.\nI have already gone through System Settings > Network > Network Proxy which was already set to \"None\", but I hit \"Apply System-Wide\" anyway and rebooted, to no avail.  Maybe I will try \"Manual\" and leave the settings black.  I have no proxy to use for any application.\nP.S. My real issue is a low number of X11 apps/windows allowed to open.  I have started doing killall pxgsettings which is really killing the unity-lens-junk processes which frees up X resources, and I can keep operating my system, as kind of a side effect.  There's also some X localhost socket limit set too low, or something.  Onward.\n", "Q: After logging in, there's a black screen and my cursor, nothing else! in Ubuntu 12.10 I've been using Ubuntu(12.10) for a long time, and recently, my Ubuntu went through yet another update.\nThe whole update prompt showed up, following by a password prompt, and finally the good ol' progress bar...\nEverything went well, and later on, I shut down my computer.\nThe next day, I turned my PC on, went to the login screen. I went ahead, and logged in, but after that, all I could see was a black screen, and my cursor!\nI checked the forums, and got various tips, none of which worked...\nNow I'm stuck with an Ubuntu installation that's completely useless.\nOne more thing:\nI even tried logging in through Guest, but same problem! :\\\nMy Computer Specs:\nMotherboard: Intel DG41WV\nProcessor: Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 @ 2.40GHz\nGraphics: Intel G41 Express Chipset\nRAM: Dual Channel, DDR3 2*2GB (4096 MBytes)\nHDD: Seagate 500GB SATA\n\n---- DETAILED INFO ----\nTo be a little more precise about my problem, after I log in, I can see a black screen and my cursor. Plus, importantly, I was able to see a login screen, hence I'm sure Ubuntu is rendering properly, and also pretty sure that there's no problem with the drivers (Otherwise I shouldn't even get a login screen, right?).\nAnywho, another (probably) important thing is that, after logging in, I can hit Ctrl+Alt+1 and get up a recovery console.\nThe only thing that doesn't load is my actual GUI desktop\nThen, I ran unity from the recovery console, it went through a few commands, got stuck at OpenGL for a few seconds, then zoomed throught many more lines of code, and ended up with this:\nERROR 2012-01-03 20.51.23 unity.launcher.Icon TrashLauncherIcon.cpp:62 Could not create file monitor for trash url: Operation not supported\n\n*** glibc detected *** compiz: malloc(): memory corruption: 0x09c861d6 ***\n\nAfter that. back at Ctrl+Alt+F7: Desktop Background + Cursor\nSo back to the terminal again, I had to hit Ctrl+C to get back again.\nnow, I typed unity again, and this was the output:\nWARNING: no DISPLAY variable set, setting it to :D\ncompiz (core) - Info: Loading plugin: core\ncompiz (core) - Info: Starting plugin: core\nunity-panel-service: no process found\n\nso now I did a sudo service lightdm restart :\nX10: fatal IO error 4 (Interrupted system call) on X server \":0\"\nafter 131 requests (130 known processed) with 0 events remaining.\nlightdm stop/waiting\nlightdm start/running, process 2852\n\nIm back at the login screen, and I login again, now Im back to black screen (Yes, I lost the Desktop Background as well)\nSo, once again, I try unity (same response as last time):\nWARNING: no DISPLAY variable set, setting it to :D\ncompiz (core) - Info: Loading plugin: core\ncompiz (core) - Info: Starting plugin: core\nunity-panel-service: no process found\n\nAnd still a black screen! :\\\n\nA: Just for completeness, this problem also occurs when you mistakenly installed the \"nvidia-319-updates\" package, but you do not have an nVidia graphics chip on your system.\nIn my case this package was an indirect dependency from package \"libopencv-dev\".\nSo, when you're running on an ATI or Intel grpahics chip for example, and you installed openCV (package libopencv-dev), OpenGL gets broken and you'll get a black screen with mouse cursor after logging in. To resolve in this case, just remove nvidia's packages:\nsudo apt-get remove nvidia-*\n\nSee this bug on launchpad for more details\n\nA: I've successfully solved the problem. Well, what I did was this:\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:unity-team/staging\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get install unity\n\nThat, followed by a reboot, is the recipe for a fix! :D\n\nA: Maybe you need to reset compiz and Unity config files.\nYou can try a soft reset (only Unity/Compiz files, but I didn't test this):\nhttp://www.webupd8.org/2012/10/how-to-reset-compiz-and-unity-in-ubuntu.html\nThere's a hard reset:\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/244064/123806\nBut it will erase config of some apps. Try it as a test user, go to tty1 (Ctrl+Alt+F1):\nsudo adduser test\n\nReturn to tty7 (Ctrl+Alt+F7) and try login. If works, we confirm it's just a problem in your config file. Else follow the link above. (after tests, \"sudo deluser test\" and \"sudo rm -Rf /home/test\" will erase).\nIf Ctrl+Alt+T doesn't work...\nFirst login and get blank screen, then Ctrl+Alt+F1, backup and remove your config file:\ncp .config/dconf/user .config/dconf/user.bkp\nrm .config/compiz-1/compizconfig/config .config/dconf/user\n\nWe need to remove both files at same time.\nCtrl+Alt+F7 and the expected is Unity will open.\n\nA: I had same issue, but i noticed that after running \nsudo apt-get remove nvidia-*\ncommand, which did not changed anything (even after reboot)\nthere were some old unnecessary packages, and after removing them with command\nsudo apt-get autoremove\nand rebooting all was correct, desktop is loading as expected.\n\nA: I had the same problem, and a shorter fix worked for me:\nunity --reset\n\nFollowed by:\nsudo service lightdm restart\n\nTrouble is, you lose settings such as icon sizes, etc. These can be easily reconfigured using MyUnity or UbuntuTweak (from the software center).\n(However, the problem comes back every time I connect an extra display to my laptop before booting. But that's a different problem, I presume. Discussed here: Ubuntu 12.04 Unity: Black screen with cursor only, when external display is connected before booting laptop)\n\nA: try\nctrl-alt-f2\nlogin\ntype: \nsudo update-grub\nsudo reboot\n\n", "Q: Why isn't rc.local executed?

I think your problem is caused by Xinerama being on really. i suggest using the amdcccle program to configure it. You could also use lxrandr, it's very simple to use, but without installing anything else, use \"gksudo amdcccle\", expand the  Display Manager group, and click on Xinerama. make sure there is no check there. It may be grey. if it's grey, select Display Manager, click the down arrow in the upper right corner of the icon representing monitor 2, and select \"Multi-display\" and then \"multi-display desktop with displays 1\". go back and make sure there's no check in Xinerama. \n", "Q: Trouble authorizing Everpad on Lubuntu?

My laptop is dual booted with windows in one partition and ubuntu 12.04 in another. I recently wanted to do a fresh install of ubuntu, so what I did was pop in a ubuntu installation disk and reformatted.

You're correct that the old Ubuntu system has is root filesystem on sda5.\nTypically, Ubuntu has two partitions (and sometimes more, if you set it up that way).\n\n\n*\n\n*A partition providing / (the root filesystem). In your new system it's sda7.\n\n*A partition providing swap space. In your new system it's sda6.\n\n\nYou said you removed your old Ubuntu partition? I don't know what you did remove, but perhaps it was the previous system's swap partition?\nAssuming you have no important documents or other valuable files in the old Ubuntu system (i.e., stored on sda5), you can safely remove the partition. However:\n\n\n*\n\n*Do not remove the partition while booted from the disk on which it resides. That can cause corruption, or at least system instability. It is widely warned against.\nFurthermore, you cannot make modifications to partitions that are mounted, so you would not be able to expand your new Ubuntu system's root filesystem to take up the space.\nInstead, boot from an Ubuntu live CD/DVD or live USB (like what you used to install Ubuntu), and run GParted.\n\n\n*\n\n*Or, if you prefer, boot from the GParted live CD/USB.\n\n\nIn GParted in the live environment, you can make whatever changes you like.\nRemove sda5. Slide sda6 (your swap partition) as far to the left as it will go. Then you can expand sda7 to the left, to fill up the newly unallocated space. Remember:\n\n\n*\n\n*To apply your changes by clicking the green check mark.\n\n*That when you dynamically resize a partition, even when expanding it as in this case, there is a small but significant chance of data loss.\nYou should always have backups of everything important--before performing this procedure would be a good time to make sure your backups are up to date.\nThen quit GParted and reinstall GRUB2 to the Master Boot Record.\n\n\n*\n\n*You might not have to do this, but you probably will, and you may as well do it now rather than having to boot from the live CD/DVD/USB again.\n\n\nYou can use the method here or any of these techniques. Make sure to check and see if your partitions are renumbered (after GParted runs). If worse comes to worse, you can always do it again.\nAlternatively, you might prefer to avoid dynamically resizing any partitions, and just create one or more new storage partitions in the space freed by removing sda5.

Is it possible to integrate Unity Dash in Lubuntu (Fresh Clean Install) apart from installing ubuntu-desktop.

I reverted Chrome settings in alacarte to default. But nothing. Same problem.\nUPDATE:\nI tried to fix that with dconf-editor. No changes.

This is a local version which is checked before the system wide .desktop, so if you remove it you will have still how to launch Chrome. If the Chrome icon on launcher stops working just remove it (left click -> \"Unlock from Launcher\") and add it again.\nAlso you can try to inspect that file and see what is wrong.

Having recently performed lots of package management, you may not need to run sudo apt-get update. (Unless your dependency problem was from apt-get and you didn't run it with update before, then you definitely need to.) You can decide.\n\nUbuntu's xterm is very basic in style. As far as I know, there's no GUI way for xterm to scroll back, save history, change font and font size, or anything like that. The actual shell's capabilities will of course be the same as in any Terminal, since it's still bash. (Or whatever you set it to be.)\nAlternatives\nIf you have a longer-term problem of any kind with the GNOME Terminal, you can use xterm, but it is not as friendly and (in some ways) not as sophisticated as GNOME Terminal.\nIf you continue to have trouble getting GNOME Terminal working but you're able to install software in general, you can install:\n\n*\n\n*Xfce's terminal – xfce4-terminal \n\n*LXDE's terminal – lxterminal \nYou should not use Konsole for this, however, unless you already have KDE installed.

I tried add some applications to add startup menu. But they didn't started with computer. Please Anybody help me to do that. I used only GUI method to add apllications to menu in ubuntu 12.04.Somebody please help me to do that correctly. Forget about my bad English.\n\nA: First you need to know the command of the application you want to start or the location of its binary.  The command of the application is usually its name.  For example, if you type firefox into a terminal it will start Firefox.  \nTo make Firefox start on startup, open \"Startup Applications\" from the dash.  Click 'Add' then fill out the 'Command' field with the command for the application, in this case firefox.

The Windows Installer for Ubuntu desktop instructions say that an ISO image for Ubuntu is downloaded during the installation process.\nBut what if I already have an ISO image for Ubuntu. Can I make the Windows Installer use that, so it doesn't have to download an ISO image again?\n12.04 LTS and 12.10 are the versions of Ubuntu I'm interested in installing, in case that matters.\n\nA: Yes, if you have both wubi.exe and the ISO image for the same release, you can make Wubi use the ISO so it doesn't have to download the files again. This makes installation considerably faster!\n\n\n*\n\n*It's advisable to check the MD5SUM on the ISO image, to make sure it's good.\n\n*Put the ISO image and wubi.exe in an empty folder.\nTechnically there could be other files in here, but it would be confusing, and once you get additional Ubuntu ISO's in there, which sometimes happens for users who are trying different versions, it would be a bad situation.\n\n*Run wubi.exe to install Wubi.\n\nThat's it. With the ISO image in the same folder as wubi.exe, the Wubi installer will automatically attempt to use the ISO image (and assuming it's an ISO for the same version of Ubuntu, and the ISO is not damaged, there should be no problems).\nAssuming everything goes well, it should be possible to install without even being connected to the Internet when wubi.exe is run. However, if possible, it's recommended to be connected to the Internet while installing Ubuntu (whether you install it inside Windows with Wubi as you plan to do, or alongside/replacing your existing Windows or other OS by by booting a CD/DVD?USB).\nRemember, the Windows installer (wubi.exe) and the ISO image should be for the same release of Ubuntu.\n\nA: Windows 8 currently uses UEFI so it might be problematic with Wubi on Windows 8 so you have to download Rufus (fastest one that I have tested) and the ISO.\nDownload Rufus: http://rufus.akeo.ie\nSince you have already the ISO File plug your USB Device in a fastest port possible to ensure that Rufus will install system files in a faster way.\nAfter plugging in, Follow these steps:\nHow to make Ubuntu USB:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download Rufus above\n\n*Plug your USB Device before running Rufus\n\n*Click on the CD icon on a button so Select the ISO dialog is displayed\n\n*Navigate to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS ISO File\n\n*Click START\n\n*Wait for a few minutes. It should complete it successfully.\n\n\nEnsure that your BIOS supports USB Booting so you can run Ubuntu from there, If it does not support USB booting (like my computer), then you will have to download and install another boot manager (plop boot manager) so you can boot from USB.\nHow to boot from USB Drive:\n\n\n*\n\n*Restart your computer\n\n*Put the key where it leads you to the BIOS Boot Menu, It should have the option like (USB HDD: )\n\n*Go to the USB HDD or something similar and press enter\n\n*It should boot, After booting, Press the Install Ubuntu\n\n\n\nHow to install Ubuntu:\n\n\n*\n\n*Follow the installation steps until you have reached with Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8\n\n*Click the Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 8 button\n\n*Follow these 3 steps and when you are finished, you should have the slideshow with the progress bar.\n\n\n\nHow to finalize installation:\n\n\n*\n\n*After installation is complete, Restart your computer\n\n*Unplug your USB Drive after your computer/laptop actually boots into BIOS to avoid restarting the installation depending on the boot order\n\n*Select Ubuntu when you are presented with Windows, Ubuntu.\n\n*It should boot.\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu One for Mac OS X proxy detection?

And browsers, mail and other apps are working fine.\nI had to configure proxy settings for Dropbox manually (it has such configuration). But how can I configure U1 proxy manually? If it for some reason ignores Auto Proxy Settings.\n\nA: It will read OS proxy settings on OS X, but does not work with Auto Proxy Discovery. If you set the system proxy settings manually, then they will be used.

Recently while cleansing the inside of dust with a hint of compressed air, I had removed the hard drive, the RAM, and the screws securing the case in place. Upon replacing all of the above I was met with the GRUB menu. I simply hit enter to select Ubuntu, but nothing happened.\nI came across that the keyboard was not working. I know that the keyboard is not damaged, the power button works and it's on the same connection as the keyboard to the logicboard. I read extensively on how to enable my keyboard, and I attempted to use an external USB keyboard with no avail.\nWith out the BIOS readily available since it is a Macintosh brand computer, I cannot enable legacy USB support. With the CD drive enabled it automatically boots to CD over the hard drive, but again once asked to either \"Try\" or \"Install\" Ubuntu, the mouse no longer works and the keyboard is also inactive.\nCould the problem here be software, or is it more likely hardware (torn ribbon)?\n\nA: Update: The GRUB bootloader will only work with the keyboard that is installed on the laptop, and not a USB keyboard (At least with EFI booting and without access to the traditional BIOS). After an Ubuntu reinstall I was able to determine the cause of the problem was not software. I fully removed the cable that was was linked to the logic board and found there to be creases and wrinkles along a single fold towards the forward end of the ribbon.

Thanks for the help!\n\nA: Windows 8 itself won't really be a problem, but the secure-boot stuff that is included on all windows 8 computers probably will be.

On the other hand, if you've tried proper techniques for undeleting the partition or trying to recover it, that may be very helpful. Either way, it's important you edit your question to include as many details as possible about what you've done since you deleted the partition.\nIf you don't have documents or other important files in the Ubuntu system (or you do, but they have at least one good backup somewhere else), then I strongly recommend starting over, installing Ubuntu again. It's faster, easier, and less stressful than attempting data recovery.\nIf you're going to attempt to recover a lost Ubuntu partition, first, read this Ubuntu community wiki page, it's excellent documentation.\nAs that says, if you mess up your partition table (including by removing partitions), but you don't write data to the inside of where your partitions used to be, your data are intact. This might be one off those nice scenarios. So try these techniques first.\nDepending on what you did after you deleted the partition, this might be very simple. I recommend trying GNU Parted's rescue functionality. But if you've decided to attempt to recover data, you should at least run TestDisk and Gpart, too.\n(If you need clarification or are able to give specific information about how the partitions were destroyed or about the other things you've tried, that might make it possible for us to help further.\nGood luck!\nFor the no such partition grub rescue> Scenario\nIf you deleted a partition and then saw this, that's because you deleted the partition.\nBut error this does not necessarily mean you deleted a partition! If you don't specifically remember deleting the partition in Windows, then you should:\n\n*\n\n*Check if the partition is still there. You can run sudo fdisk -l or sudo parted -l (I usually run both).\n\n\n*If it is not, continue attempting to rescue it. (Or give up. But it sounds like you feel comfortable attempting data recovery--having already done so--and you're willing to put more time into it, so just as long as you know it might not succeed, go for it.)\n\n\n*If it is still there, try reinstalling GRUB to the master boot record  (in this situation, I'd suggest a chroot-based method like this one, but really any method here or here that you haven't unsuccessfully tried yet, should be attempted.\nIf that doesn't work, try these methods for totally removing GRUB and then putting it back.\nIf that doesn't work, try using a Windows install DVD/USB, Windows rescue disk (which you can make yourself), or Windows trial install DVD/USB (usually freely downloadable from Microsoft's website) to reinstall the Windows boot loader. Boot into Windows and see what it says about the partition table (but don't modify anything in what might be the Ubuntu partition or where it used to be). Since you have Windows 8 and probably a UEFI system, try going through this (again?) and make sure all the settings are correct.\n\n\n*If you are not sure if it is there, or you don't understand what you're seeing (for instance, in the output of sudo fdisk -l or sudo parted -l), or you want to be extra cautious, ask for help! You can edit your question to add the output of those commands.\n(People with similar problems where this question doesn't solve it can post a new question, including the output of those commands and any other information that distinguishes it from this question, as well as what makes it similar.)\n", "Q: Why can't I disable the Guest session?

But since yesterday after an update of xorg-edgers (please don't ask my why I have to use that, I really have to) I got thermal crashes again. \nAt the same time the fan started to make some noise (not that it was running fast, probably rather too slow).

The configuration seems to be correct, commands like getent group, getent passwd return groups and users from AD. I can grant AD user permissions on folders and using sudo that user has access.  However, when going through samba the user has no access to the folder.  Here's some test code.  First just testing winbind and the linux permissions:\nsudo mkdir /tmp/test\nsudo chown root:sambashare /tmp/test\nsudo chmod 775 /tmp/test\nsudo usermod -G sambashare DOM+user1\nsudo -u DOM+user2 touch /tmp/test/file\n  touch: cannot touch `test/file': Permission denied\n#good because DOM+user2 is not in sambashare group\nsudo -u DOM+user1 touch /tmp/test/file\n#success!\nls -l /tmp/test\n  -rw-r--r-- 1 DOM+user1 DOM+domain users 0 Jan 14 16:53 test/file\n\nNow configuring samba share\n[Test]\n        path = /tmp/test\n        writable = yes\n        follow symlinks = yes\n        valid users = DOM+user1,@sambashare\n\nThe directory is visible to the user.  But creating new directory or file is not allowed.\nIf I change linux permissions:\nchown DOM+user1 /tmp/test\n\nI can write to the samba share from windows.  Note that I haven't added a write list to samba or anything else, just the user ownership on that share in linux.  And linux was allowing the user to write to that folder before based on group permissions.\nI've tried opening the share from Windows 7 box, and Ubuntu box via Go -> Open Location -> smb:// .  Same issue.  So I don't think it's windows.\nAnyone know what's going on?  \nEdit\nI'm trying to group domain users by local groups and allow access to certain shares, so I don't have to bother AD admins to create custom groups.  Also I want to use filesystem permissions instead of samba write lists.  It's cleaner and samba is not the only service.\nMapping a domain group to a local linux group isn't what I'm trying to achieve.\nSo for example locally I create local dev_team1, dev_team2 groups.  Add DOM+sally to dev_team1 and DOM+john to dev_team2, then set filesystem permissions using ACL.\nI thought this configuration was possible because winbind is mapping domain groups/users \nto a range specified by samba:\nidmap config * : backend = tdb\nidmap config * : range = 20000-999999\n\nAnd when you execute getent group; getent passwd you get a list of domain groups/users with ID > 20,000.  So based on that I assumed samba authenticates the user, assigns them one of the ids, and it doesn't matter if ID 20,000 is in a local group 500, or part of domain group 21,000.  \nGuess not...\n\nA: Method 1 - Change Group\nTry following\nchown :DOM+domain /tmp/test\n\nThen re-test.\nMethod 2 - Force Group\nUse samba force group to assign default group for the share\n[Test]\n        path = /tmp/test\n        writable = yes\n        follow symlinks = yes\n        force group = sambashare\n        valid users = DOM+user1\n\nMethod 3 - Add domain user to a domain group\nThis is actually a generalized method 1 and the common way in this kind of sharing\n[Test]\n        path = /tmp/test\n        writable = yes\n        follow symlinks = yes\n        force group = sambashare\n        valid users = @DOM+domainshare, @sambashare\n\nCreate an AD group domainshare and add any domain user needed to access the share into it.\nlinux user in sambashare group can access the share.\n", "Q: Why does the screen refuse to lock after I installed LXDE?

I can't understand how it would, since the mount point is a directory on the local system.\n\nA: You can't modify the file permissions of a NTFS filesystem mounted via CIFS on the VFS by default. Even when chmod and chown don't complain, they have no effect under these filesystems.\nYour best chance is to use mounting options to do the work. That is, define the permissions at mounting time. Take a look at man mount.cifs for the parameters uid and gid.\nPlease note that CIFS supports chmod and chown when you are serving ext4 filesystems, but not when serving NTFS filesystems. NTFS mounting support permissions, but they are disabled by default because you need to map the Windows User IDs (SID) to UIDs on your system. Please take a look at the article pointed on the comments by Eliah Kagan. Even when you can make the permissions mapping and make the permissions work with a direct mount, I don't know if they will work trhough CIFS, though.\n", "Q: How to automount hdd without causing freeze when missing?

I have a problem. I need to compress a root folder, but it has a lot of ZIP/BZIP/TAR files in its subfolders. Can someone show me a script that will search and unzip each subfolder's zip file and then 7-zip the root folder with maximum compression? \n\nA: It should be noted that 7z does not respect permissions properly in that it doesn't store the owner/group of the file, etc. It isn't ideally suitable for backups on Unix, so I have used tar.7z in the script below, which will still give good compression. If you really want to you could just specify .7z, but you will lose the permissions data.\nYou will need to install atool from the repositories because I use it to simplify extraction of various formats. You will also need p7zip:\nsudo apt-get install atool p7zip\n\nSimply enter the following script in your text editor, save it and make it executable. Then simply execute it in the desired folder (but see important notes below to see how it works).\n(The find command-line in this script is used from this question here.)    \n#!/bin/bash\n\nfind -mindepth 2 -type f -print -exec mv {} . \\;\nmkdir my_files\naunpack -e * -X my_files/\napack -O-mx=9 imp_files.tar.7z my_files/\nmv imp_files.tar.7z /home/$USER/\nexit 0\n\nImportant Notes:\n\n\n*\n\n*The files from the desired subfolders are delivered to the directory in which the script is executed, unless you want to add the line  cd /home/$USER/\"$1\" to the top of the script and place it in your ~/bin and then call it with script_name desired_folder.\n\n*The files are found and then moved to the pwd (present working directory), and then a new directory is created and they are all extracted to that. I have used aunpack and apack from the atools package as they enable multiple archive types to be handled at once. See my answer here for more information; aunpack is great as it allows you to extract all types of archive files, without needing to execute separately tar, 7z, etc.\n\n*After the files have been extracted to the folder specified, that folder is packed as a tar then a 7zip file with maximal compression (mx=9). Lastly, that resulting file is moved to the base of your home folder. \nIn the script, I have not deleted the files that are fetched from the subdirectories; you can add that if you wish, and tailor the script to your needs, but I hope this is useful for learning about basic scripting.\n\nA: Try to write your own, it's fun! :-)\nHere are a few ideas and starting points:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the initial data before you make any experiments! (Seriously, you'll need your backup at some point)\n\n*Make a new script called recompress.sh.\n\n*Make it executable with chmod +x recompress.sh. \n\n*You can use find to get a list of all files that need to be handled. This works recursively. See this Stackoverflow answer details.\n\n*You'd have to handle the zip files separately with unzip <fileanme> and all the tar files with tar xvf <filename>. Tar has auto detection for archive type. So make two separate find /folder -name ... loops. Or find a tool that can hanlde all archive types :-)\n\n*Delete all extracted archives (Remember that you've made a backup?)\n\n*compress it all with p7zip. Or if you want to customize the compression level and other stuff use 7zr directly.\n\n\nEdit: Actually it might be a lot easier if you start by contructing the commands step by step and examining the errors/output of each.\n\nA: You could write a script or do it the easy way by using Nautilus search.\n\n\n*\n\n*Just search for .zip → highlight all zip files and choose → 'Extract here'\n\n*(optional) delete all *.zip files\n\n*redo the step for the other file formats\n\n\nWhen done compress the root folder.\nquick & dirty :)\nPS: I love the terminal, but sometimes GUI is just faster.\nPPS: Use tar.xz to compress the root folder.\n", "Q: Can I use virtualbox to install Ubuntu Linux on Windows?

So this problem may sound familiar to a dozen other questions like these but I still haven't found an answer to mine in particular. When I installed Ubuntu I thought that when choosing to install it side by side with Windows it would just add it to the windows booter, but it didn't. And now I've got the problem that I recovered the MBR with my Win 7 disc because I still use that a lot, and I would like to be able to boot Ubuntu from that now. \nHere is where the problem comes in. My problem is that since I didn't make a seperate boot partition for GRUB, I didn't think of making logical partitions (I've got 4 primary partitions, with the one with Ubuntu on) and I need to make it extended so that I can free some space up for the boot partition so I can then configure the Win booter to boot it correctly when I choose to.\nAnd why I am just not deleting the whole partition to reinstall it (because I guess you're thinking that since it's such a fresh install why don't I just reinstall?) is because I have spent two days installing software and downloading and the only internet I have is a mobile broadband with limited bandwidth/month. \nI'm looking for a way to copy the content which is around 5 gigs to some other drive, or somehow making it an extended drive and shrink it, or erasing the partition, doing this and that, copying it back and then installing GRUB. Would this be possible? Would GRUB be able to pick it up if I were to install it through some other way? Right now I'm on the live CD.\n\nA: There's no way to convert a partition from primary to logical while keeping the data, as far as I'm aware. So the question boils down to \"how do I back up the data from a partition so I can restore it later to another partition and make Ubuntu to boot from that partition\".\nYou'll need an Ubuntu LiveCD/USB and enough space on the Windows partition or somewhere else to store the backup of data. Boot from the LiveCD and mount both the Ubuntu partition and the partition where you're going to store the backup. Then make a backup with something like\nsudo tar zcfv /media/my_backup_partition/myubuntu.tar.gz /media/Ubuntu \n\n(the reason we need to use tar (and sudo) is to preserve permissions. If the backup partition supports Linux permissions you can just copy the files to a directory there)\nThen you remove the partition, create an extended partition and logical partitions inside it. Mount the new Ubuntu partition and extract the backup:\nsudo tar zxfv /media/my_backup_partition/myubuntu.tar.gz /media/new_ubuntu_partition\n\nThen I think you'll need to edit etc/fstab on the new partition to account for the new filesystem UUID and device name (it'll likely be sda5 instead of sda1..4) or, alternatively, to use tune2fs to change the UUID to match the old one.\nThen you'll need to re-install GRUB.\nThe point is - the whole Ubuntu install is just a bunch of files, you can do with them whatever you can do with files, there's nothing magical about them.\n", "Q: cross compiling for m68000 (embedded system) How do I cross-compile for a Motorola 68000?

Can I develop for iOS on Ubuntu?\nI was told that since it was Unix based, that I could develop for iOS on Linux. But can I also upload iOS games to the Apple's App Store on Linux?\n\nA: You can upload compiled programs to Apple from an Ubuntu machine without any issues, since (I'm pretty sure) that the process takes place via a browser.\nSince iOS uses Objective-C, you can always \"code\" the app (write it using gedit or Geany, or anything else) on Ubuntu, but you won't be able to compile it into an .ipa file. \nHowever, in order to compile and test it, you will require Apple's SDK, which is only available on Mac OS X. - So, not possible. \nThere are always alternative ways to program iOS apps however. \nOne way is that you purchase a retail Mac OS X DVD, and set up a VirtualBox Machine (or VMWare, if you want). Then, download the SDK from the apple website.\nAnother way would be is to use \"on-line\" app makers, such as Tiggzi (My personal favourite, since it has a lot of options for compiling and such). On-line app makers use HTML and JavaScript for the design and functions, then compile it using PhoneGap.So, there's no need for Objective-C. \n\nSo, long story short, No, you can't make iOS apps on Ubuntu, however you may write them, but you won't be able to compile them into .ipa files. You can always submit iOS apps to Apple from any Ubuntu machine, since it is done by a browser. There are alternative ways to make them on Ubuntu - such as Virtual Machines and on-line app creators. \n", "Q: Why is Google Chrome displaying artifacts in YouTube? Since installing 12.10, Chrome has been displaying bizarre colored artifacts over youtube videos, I can still watch the videos, but it's more than a little irritating.\nI've installed Chromium, and there is no problem there.  I assume then, that it is an issue with the built in Flash plugin that comes with chrome.\nHere is a picture of the colored artifacts:\n\nAny help appreciated.\n\nA: This is because of a documented, gpu compositing bug: Issue 164555: Flickering rectangles like a swarm of bees when watching youtube and vimeo videos. On affected systems, yellow snow is seen when viewing Flash videos and orange snow is seen when viewing HTML5 content.  \nIt involves the Pepper version of Flash and certain Mesa drivers.  \nRunning Chrome with the Pepper Flash but with the --disable-accelerated-compositing switch stops the snow from appearing but WebGL function will be lost.\nThe other Flash, NPAPI Flash, also used by other browsers such as Firefox, isn't affected possibly because \"the NPAPI plugin doesn't use the GPU process and probably just provides software rendered frames\".\nThere are thus two workarounds:\ndisable the Pepper Flash and enable NPAPI Flash (if it is installed)\nor\ncontinue using the Pepper Flash but with the --disable-accelerated-compositing switch\nRead the bug for full details.\n\nA: This is not a problem with Flash plugin, but with HTML5 video.

I am trying to use the su command to run an application as another user\nIn this case I am trying to run irssi\nblah@ubuntu: su - [username] irssi\n(enter password)\n\nblah@ubuntu:\n(nothing happens)\n\nblah@ubuntu: su - [username] -c irssi\n(nothing)\n\nI run gksu and set same parameters and it works, and doesn't ask me for the user password. What is the issue? And how do I solve it?\nI should note the user was created like this\nadduser --system --disabled-login [username]\n\nif it makes any difference....sigh.\n\nA: \nThis answer should still help you, even taking the edits to the\n  question into account. In particular, an account created with\n  --disabled-login has no password set and no other means of logging\n  in, but it should still be possible to use sudo (explained below)\n  to run commands or a shell as the user. This is, in fact, how the\n  root account is set up in Ubuntu.\n\nThere are multiple problems with the command su - irssi.\nThis command tries to start a shell owned by a user named irssi.\nIt will fail if:\n\n\n*\n\n*There is no irssi user.\n\n*The irssi user's account is disabled.\n\n*The irssi user's account is disabled for interactive login. Sometimes an account is permitted to use services like FTP but prohibited from logging in normally by setting their shell to something that quits immediately, like /bin/false. Then a login immediately ends, with no message.\n\n*The password you're entering is not correct for the irssi user.\n\n\nThe - flag makes it so the shell simulates an initial login shell--that is, so it's really very much like logging on as irssi. Without the - flag, if the su command succeeded, you'd still get a shell owned by irssi, but environment variables like HOME would be unchanged.\nIf you instead want to run a program called irssi, you must invoke su differently:\nsu username - -c irssi\nIf you leave out -c username, it's the same as -c root--it attempts to run the command as root.\nAlternatively you can start a shell and then run the command:\n\n\n*\n\n*Start the shell with su username -.\n\n*In the shell, run the command (irssi).\n\n*If you're done, leave the shell by running exit.\n\n\nRunning Commands as root\nIf you want to run irssi as root, su is not the way to do it. Root logins are disabled by default on Ubuntu, and there is only rarely any reason to re-enable them. If you have enabled root login, then you should be able to use su to become root. The reason it's unnecessary to enable the root account is that, whether or not you do, you can still run commands as root with sudo.\nWhen you run commands with sudo, you put in your password, not the password of the user under whose identity you wish the command to run. Only administrators may run arbitrary commands as root with sudo (unless you reconfigure sudo to allow others to do so, of course). So a user who is not allowed to administer the system is not allowed to run commands as root with their own password.\nTo run irssi as root with sudo:\nsudo irssi\n\nAnd you would enter your password when prompted, not root's.\nExcept what password you enter, this does the same thing as:\nsu -c irssi\n\nExcept the sudo version can succeed because it doesn't require the root account to be enabled.\nLike with su, you can use sudo to run commands as another, non-root user. To run irssi as username with sudo:\nsudo -u username irssi\nIf you want sudo to behave like su - with respect to HOME--that is, you want to use the target user's HOME environment variables, you can run sudo with the -H flag:\nsudo -H irssi\n\nsudo -H -u username irssi\nYou can start a whole shell with sudo, like you can with su. Except for whose password you put in, this command has the same effect as su:\nsudo -s\n\nAnd this command has the same effect as su -:\nsudo -i\n\n(The i stands for initial login shell.)\nYou can start a shell as another user, too:\nsudo -u username -s\nsudo -u username -i\nFurther Reading on sudo\nTo learn more about sudo, take a look at:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Ubuntu community wiki.\n\n*Wikipedia.\n\n*The upstream sudo site (by the author of sudo).\n\n*man sudo\n\n*What are the benefits of sudo over su?\n\n*Why is there no option to login as root?\nWhy did gksu work when su didn't?\ngksu probably worked by running sudo.\ngksu is a frontend for both su and sudo. In Ubuntu, it defaults to using sudo (since in Ubuntu, su is typically not used for becoming root, and is only a secondary way of becoming other, non-root users).\nYou can make gksu use su as the frontend by running gksu --su-mode.\nYou can find out whether gksu is in su mode or sudo mode, and (if you wish) change this setting, by running gksu-properties. This is a per-user setting.\nWhen gksu is in sudo mode, it behaves the same as gksudo.\nFurther Reading on gksu\n\n\n*\n\n*This subsection of the Ubuntu community wiki, on \"graphical sudo\".\n\n*man gksu\n\n*The upstream gksu website (by the makers of gksu).\n\n*Stefano Palazzo's answer here about explaining gksu vs. gksudo in Ubuntu.\n\n\n\nPost-Solution Analysis\nYou found ultimately that you were able to run the necessary command with:\nsudo -u username irssi\n(Which is of the techniques listed above.)\nUltimately, you reported two pieces of information, which are sufficient to explain why it was that other techniques had failed, but that had succeeded:\n\n\n*\n\n*The username account was created with the --disabled-login flag, which makes it have no password (and no other means of logging in). Having no password doesn't mean it's possible to log in with a blank password. It means no password is sufficient to authenticate. In combination with the elimination of other means of authentication, this means username cannot authenticate at all.\nSo all su-based solutions are out. sudo can work though, because with sudo you don't authenticate as the user you're about to impersonate. Instead, you have to be authorized to impersonate them, and you authenticate as yourself (i.e., enter your own password, not theirs).\nIt's possible to set a password on the account, which removes this barrier to logging in:\nsudo passwd username\nHowever there might be a good reason the user is not allowed to log in. For example, if this user were allowed to log in, and logged in graphically, would bad problems arise from the user's environment or privileges being poorly suited to running X11 apps? If this user could log on, would that make it possible to log on remotely as that user (for machines where you have exposed network services)?\nIf you ever want to re-disable it:\nsudo passwd -dl username\nRelated: Re-disabling the root account after having temporarily enabled it.\n\n*The username account has /bin/false as its login shell.\nWhen a shell like bash runs as your login shell, it sets up your environment and gives you an interactive prompt with which to control the machine.\nWhen /bin/false runs, on the other hand, it does nothing, and reports failure. (/bin/true does nothing and reports success.)\nThe false and true commands are useful in scripting and for various testing purposes, but also for disabling an account so that when someone logs in, their login session immediately ends. That way, a password (or other means of authentication) can be enabled, and people can log in, just not for shell access. For example, if there is an FTP server, they could still access their account via FTP. If there is an SSH server, they wouldn't be able to get a shell via SSH, but they could still use sftp and scp to transfer files.\nSince username's login shell was nonfunctional, commands like su username, su - username, sudo -u username -s, and sudo -u username -i could not work.\nBut commands that don't give a shell, like sudo -u username command or su username -c 'command' could still work.\nSince commands can be run, you can change the user's login shell to something functional:\nsudo chsh -s /bin/bash username\nHowever, this should also be done with caution, as there may be a good reason to disable interactive logins for the user.\nHere, username both had disabled password and \"disabled\" shell. The absence of any working password prevented all su-based solutions from working, while the absence of a working interactive login shell prevented all shell-spawning solutions from working (except manually invoking a shell, like sudo -u username bash).\nsudo -u username command is what remained.\n", "Q: Where is \"places\" in 12.04?

Use the partitions you have as part of it (sda5, sda6). It's clearly shown in your picture that you already have two partitions on that piece of disk as being drawn in the same space (horizontally) and on the same sectors in the fdisk -l output. If you would format this partition directly (becoming a primary one) you will lose data on on both the sda5 and sda6 partitions.\nTo reclaim the space, you'll have to give up sda5 and sda6 first.\nThe history about extended partitions is that the good old MSDOS partition layout does not let you have more than 4 primary partitions. The extended partition is an extension representing itself as a primary partition, yet holding extended ones in itself.\nSo, to put it really simple as you said from the comments: sda4 = sda5 + sda6.\n", "Q: How to create a read-only link to a directory?

So, basically, this is creating a sort of symbolic link for you, but this doesn't show up as such.\nAnd to reply on the comment below on data loss... no, these instructions do not remove any files. In case you have files present on the destination path, this mount will lay over this. Just unmount to be able to list your files in the path on the filesystem underneath.

When I run the dualmon.sh script manually (after I log in), the resolution is set correctly.\nThis makes me think that the scripts are not run at all. What is the cause of this and how can I fix it?\n\nA: Using Ubuntu, the best way to get your user account to have the right resolution for your dual monitor setup is as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Delete monitors.xml from ~/.config/\n\n*Open Screen Display in System Settings\n\n*Set appropriate screen settings (use XRandR or ARandR beforehand if need be)\n\n*Then the big one - Hit Apply\nYou'll notice after doing the above that monitors.xml is rewritten, and whenever you login your dual monitor setup will work.\nSecondly, to get the login screen to work correctly the process you need to follow is as is this answer. The tricky part is ensuring your permissions are correct - On top of setting the correct permissions for the symbolic link,  you also need to make sure Others are able to access the monitors.xml file as well as the ~/.config folder.\nThe beauty of this setup is, as opposed to trying to brute force some xrandr commands, that whenever you change your resolution/monitor set-up in Ubuntu, your login screen will follow suit.\nFor both of the above to work you need to make sure you remove any references to xrandr commands at startup.\n", "Q: CPU Usage on Asus 1015BX using VAAPI (Lubuntu 12.10) I installed and configured VAAPI support and mplayer-vaapi on my Asus 1015BX.\nNow when watching 1080p HD movies the average CPU usage is around 25%.\nIs it a correct usage?\nOr it is still too much?\nMy Laptop:\nAsus 1015BX\nCPU: AMD C-60 Dual Core 1.00 GHz\nGPU: Radeon 6290\n\nA: With a 1.0 GHz processor that's a brilliant result I would say for a regular bitrate 1080p movie.\nKeep in mind that only video decoding is offloaded.

Correct schema name in Dconf can be found below the keys list, at the grey field with Description and Default value.

It only give this indication once; subsequent selections give no further indication on the Launcher.  Interestingly, if you open systems settings overview but make no further selection before putting it in the background the systems settings will always open.\nThe fact that this behaviour changes after a further selection is made might be considered a bug though I can't find a bug report matching this description.\nTo some extent I skipped this bug entirely because I have system settings locked to the launcher and access it that way.

It seems to know because of the notifications it shows when I connect or disconnect (or is that the network manager not the OS?)  \nHow do the background sync services know when I am connected and when to sync data?  \nDoes the OS have an indicator (something of the sort: we're online guys, go sync or do whatever you want) or it is up to individual programs to try every time period to check connectivity?  \nIs there something similar to the Windows Connectivity Status Indicator where Microsoft detects Internet connectivity (not just any network connectivity)?\nI am asking because sometimes I connect to the Internet via sakis3g script using USB modem, and the network manager status is offline when I do so. So I was wondering if background services know if I am connected or not (or I have to tell them myself)...\n\nA: \nHow does Ubuntu know whether I am connected to the Internet or not?\n\nIt's not aware of that. It only knows about local interface configuration and IP routing tables in that sense. Whether they work or not is not something for the OS to keep track of. Applications will find that out by themselves. E.g. A web browser that will time out on requests.\nWhy isn't this the task of the OS? The connection may be limited intentionally for security reasons for example using a proxy.\n\nIt seems to know because of the notifications it shows when I connect to disconnect\n\nNo, that's just the local connection of your interface it is reporting the status of. Once IP configuration has completed (either static or DHCP), it will say it's connected. The connection to the internet is the responsibility of your gateway in your network.\n\nHow do the background sync services know when I am connected and when to sync data?\n\nThey'll have to figure this out by themselves.\n\nIs there something similar to the Windows Connectivity Status Indicator where Microsoft detects Internet connectivity (not just any network connectivity)?\n\nNo. Ubuntu does not do any calls to the outside world to check for real internet connectivity.\n\nA: Well, you can't connect to the Internet. You can only connect to particular computers on the Internet. So a more sensible question is: Is some process keeping track of whether or not particular machines on the Internet are accessible?\nThe OS and various client-side configuration utilities maintain information about the local and local-area network configuration, possibly including the address of a gateway. And various client-side processes periodically try to access particular machines on the Internet.\nIf you want an indication of whether or not you can reach an arbitrary machine on the Internet then you can do something like ping 8.8.8.8.\n", "Q: How to get HDMI port to output to monitor?

How to create a partition (whether during or after install procedure) without setting the mount-point?\n\nA: \nAre only non-linux partitions (Windows and external drives) displayed as such in the left pane of PCManFM and Thunar?\n\nNo. Format a USB flash drive as Ext3/4 and you'll see it appear there too. If you would have another partition on your hard drive without any mount point specified in /etc/fstab it would appear there too.\nThe way the file manager mounts and manages the mounts as shown in the sidebar, has nothing to do with the system mounts. It's about what is mounting it. Using\ngvfs-mount -l\n\nyou can see which are already managed by your desktop environment. This answer and the manpage of gvfs-mount will explain quite well how to mount filesystems the command-line way the same way as your file manager does that programmatically.\nGVFS uses FUSE, an user space level filesystem approach, rather than in-kernel. It's about who manages the mounts on your system. The regular GUI file manager does not manage the system mounts (cat /proc/mounts) by design.\n\nWould (any) such partition be kept after reinstall?\n\nCompletely unrelated.

Took me an hour to figure it out though.\n\nA: I did not have a location field, but was able to work around this by:\n\n\n*\n\n*Click the CA cert box, right click the folder and click \"open file with file manager\"\n\n*Cancel out of that but keep your file manager open\n\n*Drag and drop the pem file to the CA cert box in the network config dialogue. \n\n\nThis was with bionic before official bionic release. \n", "Q: How can I connect to a Samba server using its hostname instead of the IP? I'm a beginner when it comes to Linux, and have recently put together a media server, holding all my movies, running Ubuntu 12.04.\nAfter following tutorials and forums I can successfully ping, by hostname and IP, my windows desktop box and my media server Ubuntu box fine, and vice versa.\nI've configured Samba to set up a share called Movies on my media server. I also set up an account on Samba using my Linux username, windows username with my Linux password.\nMy Ubuntu box is now visible on my network tree on my win7 box, as is the Movies share. however when I try to access the Movies share from the win7 box I do not have permission to do so.\nI noticed that by using the static IP address I issued my Ubuntu media server, I can access the share with ease.\nHowever I would like to be able to resolve the issue and access the share using the hostname of my Ubuntu media server box.\nSorry if I'm a bit unclear in my set up!\n\nA: In my case I had to restart the nmbd service\nsudo systemctl restart nmbd\n\n\nA: For me it was because my ubuntu was binding the hostname to IPv6 address, if you continue to face problems, the below article is worth a shot.\nhttp://telsonalva.blogspot.in/2016/07/how-to-access-samba-share-in-linux-by.html\nthis worked for me\n\nA: There are a couple of issues that could lead to this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enabling Netbios in your samba configuration file\nin your /etc/samba/smb.conf file, after the WORKGROUP line, add the following:\nnetbios name = PC_NAME Where PC_NAME is the name of your PC as it will show in the network. Then reset the samba service sudo service smbd restart\n\n*Not having STATIC IP\nNeed to have static IP set in order for other PCs on that network to see you. This also depends on your router and the configuration of your network.\n\n*Hostname length should be less than 15 characters\nIf your hostname is longer than 15 characters it will give an error in some cases. Type hostname to see your hostname. To change it you can either:\nsudo sysctl kernel.hostname=NAME \nor you can edit the /etc/hostname file and reboot.\n\n*In the /etc/samba/smb.conf file, look for the line that says the following:\n# What naming service and in what order should we use to resolve host names\n# to IP addresses\n;   name resolve order = lmhosts host wins bcast\n\nUncomment the line that says name resolve order and make sure that bcast is the first on in the list, should look like this afterwards:\nname resolve order = bcast lmhosts host wins\nThen restart the Samba service as I mentioned above.\nThis is all assuming it is Ubuntu the problem, you have already Samba installed and you are not working through Active Directory.\nIn many case it is also Windows. You would need to do stuff like flush the DNS and the register to it. On Windows in the terminal (cmd) do the following:\nipconfig /flushdns\nipconfig /registerdns\nYou need to reboot the PC afterwards. After this, check to see if you can see the Ubuntu PC by doing for example net view in Windows.\n", "Q: Bash function to open git repository with browser I'm trying to create a bash function so I can get this.\nThe user, via terminal, goes to the git project path like:\n/home/daniel/projects/my_super_project\nSo the user will type open and the browser will open in the github.com like:\nhttp://github.com/bla/my_super_project.git\nSo far I have this code:\nfunction teste {\n     if [ -d .git ]; then\n         remotes=$(git remote -v | awk -F'git@github.com:' '{print $2}' | cut -d\" \" -f1)\n         url=\"https://github.com/\"\n         url=\"$url$($remotes | cut -d\" \" -f1)\"\n         # here I'll open the browser\n     else\n       # git rev-parse --git-dir 2> /dev/null;\n       echo \"Not a git repo\"\n     fi;\n}\n\nI check if there is a .git folder, if so, I look for the remote origin and get its value that is inside the remote_url.

A lot of SSD-related instructions online currently say you should add allow-discards and  root_trim=yes to your GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX. I have yet to find one that says why you should do that, i.e. what exactly (if anything!) do those parameters do. Where is the documentation on this and what does it say about those two parameters' purpose?\nAccording to Cryptsetup 1.4.0 Release Notes,\n\nSince kernel 3.1, dm-crypt devices optionally (not by default) support\n  block discards (TRIM) commands. If you want to enable this operation,\n  you have to enable it manually on every activation using\n  --allow-discards\ncryptsetup luksOpen --allow-discards /dev/sdb test_disk \n\n\nbut is it the same when passed to the kernel (via GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX)?\nEdit: Kernel.org's list of kernel parameters doesn't (currently, Jan 2013, at least) have either of these options.\n\nA: From my understanding the boot parameter root_trim=yes is Gentoo specific. Within genkernel there is a script which looks for the parameter and sets the option --allow-discards with cryptsetup (see their git repository). Furthermore I found many reports of Ubuntu or Debian users which said that it worked without the root_trim parameter. I also found no lines in Ubuntus update-initramfs script.\nSo all in all it is no boot parameter, but more a parameter to cryptsetup.\nThe documentation of --allow-discards can be found in the manpage of cryptsetup(8):\n\n--allow-discards\n   Allow using of discards (TRIM) requests for device.  This option is only relevant for create, luksOpen or loopaesOpen.\nWARNING: Assess the specific  security  risks  carefully  before\n                enabling   this  option.   For  example,  allowing  discards  on\n                encrypted devices may lead to the leak of information about  the\n                ciphertext  device  (filesystem  type,  used space etc.)  if the\n                discarded blocks can be located easily on the device later.\nKernel version 3.1  or  more  recent  is  required.   For  older\n                versions is the option ignored.\n\nBased on this blog on TRIM & dm-crypt, TRIM is operation where upper layer (e.g. filesystem) informs the device which sectors are no longer used (do not contain valid data anymore) and that the device does not need to keep that data content.\nIn Linux terminology is this operation called discard. In the SCSI world it's be referred to as the UNMAP command.\nThe discard operation can be used for two purposes: thin Provisioning (informs that data area can be returned to allocation pool) and for SSD operation optimization.\nDiscards is most useful for SSD optimization since the internal architecture uses larger blocks than sectors and that the blocks must be erased before a write operation can be performed. Information about sectors which do not need to keep data is very useful since the filesystem would be able to more effectively organize blocks in such a way that data fragmentation is minimized and also the disk lifetime would increase.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One: PUT to upload a file which is larger than 16302 bytes fails systematically I am trying to create an app to upload/download files to Ubuntu One, using the cloud API. Now I am at the point of implementing the upload part of the app, and I have this problem with my test case:\nAll files under 16303 bytes are uploaded with no problem whatsoever.\nAll files above 16303 bytes systematically fail to upload, with a 500 status code being returned.\nI spent hours searching the web for a similar problem, to no avail.\nI am using Go language, and here is the call to Ubuntu One REST API (error handling and housekeeping code removed for conciseness):\n// 'n' is an object which describes the file to upload (path, size, etc.)\nfile, _ := os.Open(localTargetDir + n.Path)\napiUrl, _ := url.Parse(\"https://files.one.ubuntu.com/content\" + remoteTargetDir + n.Path)\n// Following line returns a pointer to a Request object with the \"Authorization\" \n// fields in the header all properly set\nrequest, _ := ubuntuoneGetSignedRequest(\"PUT\", apiUrl.String(), file)\nrequest.Header.Add(\"Content-Length\", fmt.Sprintf(\"%d\", n.Size))\nrequest.Header.Add(\"Content-Type\", \"application/octet-stream\")\nresponse, _ := http.DefaultClient.Do(request)\nif response.StatusCode >= 300 {\n    return errors.New(fmt.Sprintf(\"Error (status=%d) creating remote file: %s\", response.StatusCode, n.Path))\n}\n// ...\n\nAs said, a file size of 16303-16304 bytes is the pivot point where the upload will begin to fail systematically. I have no idea where the problem lies.\n\nA: Finally found the problem. It's a Go language thing, not a Ubuntu One thing.\nApparently, the field request.ContentLength needs to be properly set:\nrequest.Header.Add(\"Content-Type\", \"application/octet-stream\")\nrequest.ContentLength = n.Size\nresponse, _ := http.DefaultClient.Do(request)\n\nIt might appears obvious in retrospect (not really since it was working fine for files smaller than 16304...), but I haven't seen this documented in the Go doc.\nHopefully, this will be useful to someone at some point experiencing a similar problem.\n", "Q: How to disable Postfix SPF from rejecting mail?

It's not beautiful and modern looking, but it runs a lot faster and uses less memory.\nI also would recommend against installing old versions of ubuntu; you're not likely to see much speed improvement by doing that, and you're going to run into more issues sooner related to package management.\n\nA: Mine is very similar, Pentium 4 2.8 GHz and 394 MB DDR1 RAM. This box was driven by Lucid for 2 years until broken recently with faulty RAM. Now it was up again by installation of Precise. And this answer was made from this born-again box. I recommend you try a new graphic adaptor.

You can do this with another linux based machine and tools such as Nmap.\nAlternatively, if you have access to another machine, and it has a serial port on, and you can get hold of a serial to serial cable try connecting the two machines and see if anything appears on the serial port.\nMost *nix based Operating Systems (Ubuntu included) will in most cases make a terminal available on serial port if one is detected at boot up.\nIf you fire up a serial terminal on the working machine and get a login prompt from the other machine you know your booting ok, and the issue is likely a graphics driver and / or display resolution out of range problem.\nAnother thing you can also try is pressing various combinations of ctrl+fkey or ctrl+alt+fkey  In most cases this will drop you to a command line and providing your install is not trying to set a strange console resolution from the boot you may actually get something usable.\nUPDATE FOLLOWING OP's addition of comment stating removal of hard drive\nI can only assume that you booted from a Live distro CD, in which case it sounds to me like the primary partition on your first hard drive is not marked as bootable.\nIf this is the case, you need to do 2 things as follows:\n1) Put the internal hard drive back in, then using the laptops BIOS configuration, set the boot priority of the machine to boot first from CD/DVD then from the first hard disk.  To get into your BIOS there will be some message on your post screen that states press XXXX to enter setup.  XXXX is often the del key, or F1, F2 so on.\n2) Use the disk partitioning tools on the live CD (You'll most likely need to be in rescue mode) and set the first partition on your hard disk to be bootable.\nIF all is ok and there is a working OS on that drive, then you should hopefully see it start to boot, if it tries to start from CD/DVD then remove the disk from the drive and try again, or use your BIOS as previously described to change the boot order back to hard drive first.\nIF the primary hard drive partition is already marked bootable, then chances are your hard drive has a damaged first few sectors.  Now this is not as bad as it sounds, you can sometimes if your lucky manage to partition around it, but you need to start getting very creative with your partitioning tool if your going to do this, it's not a job for the feint of heart.\n", "Q: Apache Tomcat webapps have to use a proxy I've installed Apache Tomcat and want to use a proxy for my webapps.

I find grub 2's configuration files to be way too messy to try and learn all of their intricacies, so I simply use the available GUI programs instead.\nI highly recommend startupmanager and/or super-boot-manager  (you might have to add a ppa for the latter).\nOnce installed, you simply fire up the GUI software and configure your grub (super-boot-manager can be also used to configure burg, which is a grub-based alternative with a some very good-looking themes). If all you want to do is change the default OS for booting, then all you have to do is select it from a roll-down list and press OK.\nIf you want to configure grub's config files directly, you're not supposed to be touching /boot/grub/grub.cfg. That file is supposed to be generated automatically based on what's written in a slew of files in /etc/grub.d/.

I would like to schedule a restart of my Ubuntu every 30 minutes. Is there any command or a graphical way to do it?\n\nA: Run sudo crontab -e from the command line and add this line to the file:\n0,30 * * * * reboot\nThis tells the system to run the command reboot every 30 minutes as root. For an overview of the time syntax, see here: http://linuxmoz.com/crontab-syntax-tutorial/\n\nA: The best way to do this will depend on why you want Ubuntu to restart every half hour.\nSo I recommend editing your question to explain why you wish to do this.\nRebooting every 30 minutes, and warning users before each reboot:\nAssuming people might be using the machine, either locally or remotely, it's best to avoid restarting Ubuntu from under them without any warning. Therefore, rather than scheduling the reboot command, I recommend scheduling the shutdown command so it warns the user.\nTo schedule a shutdown every half hour with a warning 5 minutes before, add this to /etc/crontab:\n#minute hour    mday    month   wday    user    command\n*/30    *       *       *       *       root    shutdown -r +5\n\nYou don't actually have to add the fist line, which is a comment. I've included it for clarity--something like it is there already.\n\n*\n\n*This will schedule the system to go down for reboot (-r) five minutes after (+5) the command runs. It runs every at every half hour mark (*/30). See man cron and man 5 crontab.\n\n*Change +5 to something else to change how long users have after being warned of reboots.\n\n*0,30 under minute will also work, if you prefer that. (Similarly, if it were every 20 minutes, you could write */20 or 0,20,40.)\n\n*Make sure /sbin is in the PATH variable specified near the top of /etc/crontab. Otherwise, shutdown (under command) will have to be invoked as /sbin/shutdown.\n\nThe command will always run on the half-hour mark, if the machine is up and running at that time. This will cause the shutdowns to be announced every half hour and performed at 5 minutes and 35 minutes past the hour.\n\n*\n\n*One benefit here is that an administrator can cancel the just-announced shutdown with sudo shutdown -c.\n\n*If the computer is down during the specific times when the scheduled command is to be run, it will not run. If that's not adequate to your needs, you'll have to schedule your reboots differently. (This is not specific to the use of shutdown but would apply equally if you were scheduling reboot.) In that case, please edit your question to explain your specific needs. (I'd recommend anacron for this, but your time intervals are far too short.)\n\nMaking it easier for administrators to prevent automatic reboots from happening at all:\nYou might want to set this up so that it's easy for an administrator to suspend all automatically scheduled reboots:\n#minute hour    mday    month   wday    user    command\n*/30    *       *       *       *       root    [ -e /etc/noautoreboot ] || shutdown -r +5\n\nThis schedules reboots the same way--every half hour, with five minutes warning--except that it will not schedule a reboot if a file called noautoreboot exists in /etc.\n\n*\n\n*This control file can be created by an administrator with:\n  sudo touch /etc/noautoreboot\n\n\n\n*It can be deleted with:\n  sudo rm /etc/noautoreboot\n\n\n\n*Note that it's whether or not the file exists, not what it contains, that matters.\n\n\n*If the reboot is scheduled and users are warned, then the file is created, the (immediately upcoming) reboot will still occur.\n\n\n*How does this work? It uses a short-circuit-evaluated or operator (||) as shorthand for:\n\nIf /etc/noautoreboot doesn't exist, run shutdown -r +5.\n\nThis answer explains how short-circuit and and or operators can perform if-then logic. For a brief, intuitive and highly informal explanation, you can read the command this way:\n\n/etc/noautoreboot exists! Or, run shutdown -r +5.\n\nSee man [ to see how the test itself is performed.\n\nA: I love doing this by telling the Session Manager we want to reboot. This can be done without root permissions, and we get a nice window that warns us that the system is going to be rebooted -even we can cancel the reboot if we like to.\nThe Graphical Way - Preferred Method\nInstall gnome-schedule from the Ubuntu Software Center. If you don't want to install anything additional, do it the Terminal Way.\nOpen gnome-schedule from the dash, create a new repeated task, and set these options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Description: Whatever you want\n\n*Command: dbus-send --print-reply --dest=\"org.gnome.SessionManager\" /org/gnome/SessionManager org.gnome.SessionManager.Reboot\n\n*Choose X Application just below the command.\n\n*Time and Date, Advanced:\n\n*\n\n*Minute: 0,30\n\n\n\nLeave the other options at their default values. Click on Add.\n\nThe Terminal Way - No Need for Additional Software\nRun from the terminal:\ncrontab -e\n\nAdd this line:\n0,30 * * * * DISPLAY=:0 dbus-send --print-reply --dest=\"org.gnome.SessionManager\" /org/gnome/SessionManager org.gnome.SessionManager.Reboot\n\nSave & exit. Assuming you are using nano (the default one), press Ctrl+o and Ctrl+x.\nPlease notice this won't work if your DISPLAY is actually different from :0, and that's the reason this method is not preferred. But, honestly, if you are rebooting your computer every 30 minutes, your DISPLAY will most probably always be :0.\nNot using Gnome or Unity?\nBoth methods explained above depends on some gnome components, found both on Gnome sessions and on Unity. If you want to do this on another environments (such as Kubuntu's KDE, Kubuntu's LXDE...) you better replace the command with this one instead:\ndbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=\"org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit\" /org/freedesktop/ConsoleKit/Manager org.freedesktop.ConsoleKit.Manager.Restart\n\nThis won't ask for confirmation, and will restart inmediatly, but will work on all environments, assuming you have not manually uninstalled ConsoleKit, of course.\n\nA: Use cron to schedule a job every 30 minutes.  Point that job at a shell script that simply has \nreboot\n\nin it.\nSince cron runs as root, you shouldn't need to do anything special in terms of permissions.\nUpdate\nYes I do, in fact I never on any of my systems allow user based crontabs (There are better ways of allowing users to do user level scheduled tasks) cron was designed from the very beginning purely for system automation and not for users to schedule ordinary tasks.  Things such as log rotations (which still happens today)\nReboot MUST be run as root to work correctly, the alternative is to set it's sticky bit, so that when run as a regular user it actually executes as root and works as expected, but in doing that your then opening your server up to allowing regular users to reboot it at will.\nYou could even possibly automate a call to SUDO, but I need to dig into that one, not sure if you can automate the need for a password with SUDO (I don't use it often, i prefer to just drop straight to a root shell using SU)\nIf you set it up in system wide crontab then everything is run as root, so my statement is accurate (I just neglected to mention that the system wide one should be used)\nAs for your question \"Why Wrap it in a script?\" well, why not?  If the OP puts it in a shell script, then at some point in the future needs to add to it, he simply adds to the script, instead of having to open crontab locate the job, remove it, replace it with a shell script, then write a script with the old + new in.\nOver 20 years as a Sys Admin / Developer working with systems as far back as Ultrix / Solaris and even VAX has taught me one major point.\nIf you can make it easier at the beginning, then it remains easy for it's life time.\nI really don't get this \"Minimalistic\" attitude that a lot of modern day sys admins have, where doing as little as possible is the key to success.  Most servers these days are easily 20 times+ more powerful than anything I ever started out on, and this kind of scenario (Wrapping in shell scripts) was recommended practice then, so there's really no argument for not doing it now.\nUnless you really want to go hardcore Unix/Linux, in which case tag it all onto the cron entry, and pipe everything together the way it ought to be done :-)\nHowever, I do digress, and also understand that many guys these days a thrown in at the deep end and told to make things work, as such they lack the time (and usually the inclination) to sit down and learn about new techniques (or old in this case) or even want to play with this stuff outside of work.\nI personally, have a single server among the ones I run that's dedicated purely for me to play around on, so I can test things like this... which is better A or B, so it's not without reason that I advise on any of this.\n", "Q: How can I improve my boot time?

So I will show you a short but effective method.\nActually, I don't know how to install that version of nginx-common, but I know that you will solve your problem by reinstalling all the package. To do that you must enter the following command in a terminal.\nsudo apt-get remove nginx* && sudo apt-get install nginx-full\n\n\nA: I have a strong feeling that you forgot to run sudo apt-get update prior to running sudo apt-get upgrade - the package manager uses old information about nginx-common package version while nginx-full requires a newer version.\n", "Q: Ubuntu on ThinkPad. Erase recovery partition and burn a recovery cd instead I want to turn my dual-boot ThinkPad T400 winXP + ubuntu 12.10 into single Ubuntu machine, i.e. delete Windows and recovery partitions, and use all the disk space for Ubuntu. \nBefore doing so, I would like to create a recovery media (cd/dvd or backup to external hd). And here a problem starts. \nLenovo provides Rescue and Recovery software that makes possible to create recovery disk in Windows. However, I can not use it to create recovery cd because after installing Ubuntu the software does not see the recovery partition and can not copy the data to a cd. \nI think it is related to this: http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Rescue_and_Recovery \nThe service partition is visible in Grub but it does not start when run (i guess it's the thing described in the link above). However, in Windows nor in Ubuntu the partition is not visible, and I do not know how to access it. \nDoes anyone have an idea what to do in order to create the recovery media and what things later have to be done when I would like to use it? \nThe best option for me would be if, I could also be able to create a Windows virtual machine form this recovery media. Any ideas? \nThanks! \n\nA: Regarding viewing the drive through Ubuntu, usually Ubuntu will auto-mount any partition types it recognizes, so if that's not happening, maybe it is a file system type that isn't supported without something else being installed. Or perhaps you simply need to mount it manually. If you run sudo fdisk -l, this may help identify the path to the the partition.  \nOnce you have it mounted in Ubuntu, you can then consider dd'ing the contents of the partition to a file, from which in the future, you could rebuild the drive. \n", "Q: Packaging commercial application I'm developing a project tracking application that I intend to release not far in the future as a commercial (for purchase) app in the software center.

I know that these things will not change immediately, but I'm thinking about the strategic decision to ensure good support from Canonical.\n\n\n*\n\n*Will QML/QT be the way forward now also for the desktop environment?\n\n*Is Quickly now a tool of the past?\n\n*What languages will be the preferred languages? Is C++ and JavaScript the way for the future while Python and Vala might not be the most strategic choices?\n\n*How will this affect existing APIs? Will the traditional model with libraries change?\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Qt has been a first-class toolkit on Ubuntu for several cycles, and will likely become one of the most important toolkits for cross-formfactor development on Ubuntu.  But no existing languages or toolkits are being deprecated on the Desktop.\n\n*Yes, Quickly will be less important as a tool for developing Ubuntu SDK apps.  The Quickly developers have decided that it would be better to build the same functionality into QtCreator itself, rather than build Qt/QML templates for Quickly.\n\n*QML (which can contain Javascript) will be the recommended language and toolkit for cross-formfactor development in Ubuntu.  Python, Vala, C and C++ will continue to be available, though the extent to which they are recommended for new development may change.\n\n*Existing APIs should not be affected by the Ubuntu QML Toolkit, though which ones we recommend will change depending on which ones best support our various formfactors.\n\n\nI hope this answers your questions and concerns.\n", "Q: Webkit2.h, what package does it reside in?

I have an Aopen i945GMM-HL motherboard.  It still works fine, and the BIOS is set to allow WakeOnLAN to power up the machine but since a recent OS update those magic packets just don't work anymore.\nHere's the output of lspci -v for the NIC:\n03:00.0 Ethernet controller: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88E8053 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 22)\n    Subsystem: AOPEN Inc.

Apparently back when the kernel I used to use was made, power management options were never read from the BIOS.  All that changed, but some BIOSes report their data incorrectly resulting in breakage of some power management features for some users.  Workarounds were posted to the Linux Kernel Mailing List as patches but it was decided to add a module option instead.\nSo. If you're having a hard time getting wakeonlan to work with your system despite what ethtool & your BIOS settings say, try putting this into a .conf file (e.g. sky2.conf) in /etc/modprobe.d/ \noptions sky2 legacy_pme=1\n\nFYI, if unloading the sky2 module to try it with the legacy_pme option yourself, be sure to set wakeonlan back on with \nsudo ethtool -s eth0 wol g\n\nbefore powering the system down\n\nA: I wanted to share some information - this may help with your wakeonlan (WOL) issue with the Marvell device.\nI have a Shuttle device with Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88E8056 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 12). I have been running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and XBMC, with the Sky2 driver v1.25. WOL running just fine in this setup. \nI recently had to upgrade to 12.04 LTS as part of  another story, and run into the WOL problem not working anymore with Sky2 v1.30 \nThe Sky2 driver fails because of parameter handling of Y2_HW_WOL_ON and Y2_HW_WOL_OFF and the register writes, during the sky2_wol_init function.\nI am by no means a Linux developer, but using a combination of lspci and setpci commands, I sniffed out the registers in the Marvell device that were set by the driver v1.25 and the driver v1.30, and now set the register manually with setpci when running the v1.30 driver. Wakeonlan works again with 12.04 LTS and v1.30 driver without any recompiling!\nThe register (in my system) is at 0x41, and needs its value setting to 0x80. My Marvell chip is on the PCI bus at 02:00.0, found using lspci.\nI added this command in the same startup script used to run the ethtool sequence: \nsetpci -s 02:00 41.b=80\n\nSo, a nasty hack, but works fine. I would fix the sky2.c driver if I knew how to build a kernel driver on my system…\n", "Q: Apt-mirror: Illegal division by zero I'm trying to set up an apt-mirror service for an offline repository but I've hit a weird error.

Replace it by a normal space.\n\nExplanation: line 204 in the script is where apt-mirror compares the number of URLS — which is always numeric — with the value of the nthreads configuration setting. The parser for configuration settings doesn't check for numeric values, so a non-numeric value isn't detected until the setting is used. M-BM- displays two unprintable bytes c2a0 (0x42=B and 0x20=space, with M- indicating +0x80); this two-byte sequence encodes the unbreakable space in UTF-8.\n\nIn the future, post the full content of your configuration file when you ask such questions.\n", "Q: Unable to install wine on 12.10 64-bit These commands did not work for me as discussed in this question:\nsudo apt-get install wine\n[sudo] password for shami: \nReading package lists...

I know that there's a chance that this is just an unsolvable hardware issue that I might just have to live with (or write a driver).\nThanks in advance for your time.\n\nA: Yes, I encountered this same problem (although in a different way).  \nIn my case it was due to agressive powersaving on USB ports.\nThis was something I did (to) myself.\nIf you want to change this behaviour (which, I guess, you do), you could create a permanent settings file to force USB always on.\nOpen a root console and type (or copy/paste):  \necho 'ACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", TEST==\"power/control\" ATTR{power/control}=\"on\"' >/etc/udev/rules.d/usb_power_save.rules\n\n\nA: For those of you using powertop: <TAB> to \"Tunables\" section and make sure \"Autosuspend for USB device\" or \"Autosuspend for unknown USB device\" is off (\"Bad\" on left). \nI was using sudo powertop --auto-tune in /etc/rc.local, so I had to add this afterwards: for i in /sys/bus/usb/devices/*/power/control; do echo on > $i; done.\n", "Q: Why does /var/lock/tt-rss keep being deleted after reboot? I use sudo mkdir /var/lock/tt-rss/ to create this folder which a program called tiny rss needs. But if I reboot Ubuntu, the lock and tt-rss folders no longer exist. It's as if Ubuntu is treating them like temp folders.\nI need /var/lock/tt-rss/ to be a permanent folder. How can I make it stay? I could probably do a startup entry, but that seems more of a workaround than a fix.\n\nA: Since Oneiric, /var/lock is a symlink to /run/lock:\n$ ls -ld /var/lock\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 Jan 15 18:30 /var/lock -> /run/lock\n\n/run and /run/lock are tmpfs filesystems:\n$ mount | grep /run\ntmpfs on /run type tmpfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,size=10%,mode=0755)\nnone on /run/lock type tmpfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,size=5242880)\n\nIn other words, your files are not stored on your root filesystem, but are lost at every reboot by design.\nFiles in /{var,run}/lock are not meant to be long-term storage locations. To solve your problem, you can create a script that creates /var/lock/tt-rss/ at every boot, and maybe that backups its content at every shutdown (depending on your needs).

You are.)\nOnce you've done that, everything else will work as expected.\n\nA: An .iso file and an .img file can normally be used interchangeably with little or no effect. Just rename the file so that it includes a .img extension.\ncp ubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64.iso ubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64.img\n\nIf you get stuck, you can burn an image to DVD, as well as a thumb-drive.\n", "Q: \"Shut down\" takes me to greeter now? UPDATE - Removing my USB wifi dongle seems to cure the problem. So does disabling networking (but not disabling wifi alone). Now what?\nUPDATE 2 - The 'uptime' command says there are 2 users logged in. This will surely cause the behaviour I'm describing. I'm going to dig around and see if I can determine who the other user is. Nevermind, this was only due to the terminal I had open on the desktop.\nIf I log in to any account, choosing 'shut down' or restart takes me to the greeter. The same happens in the greeter itself - I am left there. No other users are logged in.\nIf I don't log in to an account after rebooting, the restart and shut down menu options in the greeter will work if I choose them immediately after the greeter appears.

I am not using it as an answer as it doesn't identify the root cause, but for others who are happy with just a solution for themselves they should try this advise from grendndelman.net\nCreate a file named /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/usershutdown.pkla (the name must end in .pkla) and put the following in it:\n[Allow Shutdown]\nIdentity=unix-user:*\nAction=org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.stop-multiple-users\nResultAny=yes\nResultInactive=yes\nResultActive=yes\n\n[Allow Restart]\nIdentity=unix-user:*\nAction=org.freedesktop.consolekit.system.restart-multiple-users\nResultAny=yes\nResultInactive=yes\nResultActive=yes\n\n\nA: If more than one person is logged on pressing the shutdown button will take you to the greeter. You can still shut down with the command line with the command, sudo shutdown -h now\n\nA: Try sudo halt. It would be interesting to find out if that, too sends you to the greeter.\n\nA: Even if this might not be your problem, a good tip for anyone coming by having this issue:\nI thought I was having the same problem:\nTurns out that \"shutdown\" doens't work if another session (SSH, ctrl-alt-f1, etc) is logged in.\nIn my case, the first time this happened I had an SSH session open to check for temps, but from that point on it was always some sort of \"now check what happens in the logs\"-session, making the problem be very consistent. \nQuiting all ssh/other logins made the shutdown work again.\n\nA: try to shutdown from terminal \npress ctrl + F1 then run sudo poweroff ,or just run sudo poweroff from terminal may this temporarily solve the problem\n\nA: You can use the commands\n\nusers\n\nor \n\nw\n\nto see if someone else is logged in somehow.\n\nA: You could force it. Make sure previous users LOG OUT instead of SWITCH USERS.\n", "Q: Touchpad moves way too fast I recently put Ubuntu on my MSI U120. When I use my touchpad though, it is way too sensitive and the pointer moves super fast. I went to the place where you can change the sensitivity in the dash but it was already to as \"slow\" as it could go. So I did some research and found that this worked:\nsudo apt-get install gsynaptics\ngpointing-device-settings\n\n\nA: I solved my problem by entering these two lines and then adjusting the sensitivity.\n\n\nsudo apt-get install gsynaptics\n      gpointing-device-settings\n\n\n\nA: Open a terminal\nRun the command: xinput --list --short and note the name of your device.\nSet the constant deceleration for the device:\nxinput --set-prop \"Razer DeathAdder\" \"Device Accel Constant Deceleration\" 5\nThat's it. You might have to play around with the value, 5 is good for me.\nTo see the current settings for the device:\nxinput --list-props \"Razer DeathAdder\"\n[http://patrickmylund.com/blog/lowering-gaming-mouse-sensitivity-in-ubuntu-9-10/][1]\nOn my Acer Aspire 5250 I have an ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad which was happier at 7\nxinput --set-prop \"ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad\" \"Device Accel Constant Deceleration\" 7\n", "Q: \"ctrl+space\" has been bound to invoke some input method and does not work in Emacs or Eclipse auto-complete In Emacs run in terminal, ctrl+space is a standard shortcut key to select region. But under Ubuntu 12.04, it will invoke some input method for non-English language. I was wondering if I can reserve it for Emacs only? \nUnder System Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts, I couldn't find to what ctrl+space has been bound. Strange.\nOther programs, especially auto-complete in Eclipse, also seem to have a problem handling ctrl+space.\n\nA: ibus causes me nothing but headaches.  Everytime that I try to change the settings, when I reboot, the Ctrl+Space comes back.  Here's my solution:\nsudo apt-get purge ibus\nsudo killall ibus\n\nNow everything works until Ubuntu decides their next stupid thing.  Maybe the letter 'o' will map to turning off the computer?\n\nA: After upgrade to ubuntu 14.04, I had the same problem. What I did.\nIn Ibus preferences:\nSystem > Preferences > Keyboard Input Methods.\nThere is an option: Next input method it was set to ctrl+space, I removed that and then all started to work back again.\n\nA: Disable the IBUS trigger using the commandline:\ngsettings set org.freedesktop.ibus.general.hotkey triggers @as []\n\nOr if this does not work try if the first one produces an error:\ngsettings set org.freedesktop.ibus.general.hotkey triggers []\n\n\nA: It sounds like you have Ibus running, which uses Ctrl + Space by default to enable/disable the input editor.\nYou can change the shortcut key assigned to it in Ibus Preferences.\n\nIf Ibus is running in the menubar, you can right-click to choose Preference from the menu. If Ibus is not running in the menubar, you can start the Preferences dialog from the Dash by running Keyboard Input Methods or from the terminal with ibus-setup.\nUpdate for 14.04\nibus-setup is no longer available for 14.04. Functions from the former ibus-setup are instead integrated into System Settings >> Text Entry. \nInput switching is now set by default to Super + Space, but Ibus may still steal focus from the Control + Space keybinding and cause other system problems, most notably the auto-complete in Eclipse.\nIntegration of Ibus input switching into the new Text Entry settings is still a work in progress, and this is causing the problem since the older setting still exists behind the scenes.\nIf you have upgraded from 12.04, ibus-settings should still be available.\nIn 14.04, you can edit the settings directly is dconf-editor.\nIf it is not installed:\nsudo apt install dconf-editor\n\nThen browse to Desktop >> ibus >> general >> hotkey. The trigger and triggers setting will still show 'control+space'. Edit these settings out, being careful to leave empty brackets [] in triggers.\n\nA: Ubuntu Studio 14.04 (XFCE) here.\nI didn't have problem with Autocomplete (Ctrl + Space), but with Copy Line (Ctrl + Alt + Down).\nThis worked for me:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Windows Manager: xfwm4-settings\n\n*Go to Keyboard tab\n\n*Scroll down to conflicting Action\n\n*Hit Clear button or change action to different shortcut\n\n\nA: I have Ubuntu 14.04 GNOME with LXDE. Apparently this desktop has ibus-setup. So, for me, changing the ibus setting was the right fix. Perhaps it was only Unity that did away with the ibus-setup app. \n\nA: The dconf-editor change was not sufficient for me. I have the Mozc (Japanese) input source installed.\nOn Ubuntu 16.04, I also had to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Settings -> Text Entry\n\n*Click Mozc to highlight\n\n*Click the wrench/screwdriver icon below\n\n*Global Config tab\n\n*The first setting there, \"Trigger Input Method,\" was CTRL_SPACE. I clicked it and then hit Escape to unset the keybinding.\n\n\nA: For some people using Japanese input with fcitx, check Fcitx Configuration. There's a menu for global configuration, and under Trigger Input Method, the default shortcut will be Ctrl + Space.\n", "Q: Disk operations consuming all memory - Ubuntu 12.10 i386 I'm having a strange problem with a new clean install of Ubuntu 12.10, any disk operations I do, like restoring a backup eats all my 8gb of ram, and it doesn't seen to release the memory, so I'm using swap.\nIt looks like a memory leak, but I don't know if I'm right.\nI don't know where to begin for diagnose this things.\nDetails:\nI don't have any applications open, except my backup being restored by ubuntu's backup application (duplicity). I'm monitoring the memory utilization by htop and free.\nI know there's a lot of cached memory, but the system becomes slow and I'm using swap, so I think the kernel or whatever it is causing this problem is not freeing cache when requested.\n\nA: You can try to run these commands from Terminal: \nsudo -s\necho 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches  \n\nI have used it as well, and my \"used mem\" in top is ~ 1G again!\n\nA: I had a similar situation.\nIt seems that once Ubuntu starts using swap, it doesn't release RAM easily even after the operation is finished.\nI found a solution by running two commands after the RAM intensive operation is over. That is: sudo swapoff -a followed by sudo swapon -a. This disables swap during which anything in swap is transferred in RAM and re-enables it.\nI would suggest you try to do the restore gradually if possible. Give more details in your question for specific help with this.\n\nA: Well my problem is resolved by using a newer kernel, I'm using kernel 3.8 and do not have this problem now.\n", "Q: Unable to set Google Chrome as default browser in Ubuntu 12.10 despite several attempts at making Google Chrome work as my default browser I simply cannot.\nI've read countless threads on the internet, checked mimeapps.list and so on, tried about anything, from simple system configuration by going to settings and change as the default browser there, which, for some odd reason, won't allow me to set a default browser, to more advanced terminal scripting.\nThis is a clean install of Ubuntu 12.10 x64 bit updated to the latest version including kernels.\n\nA: When I tried, choosing the default browser from System Settings worked for me. Here is the procedure.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*Go to System Setting > Details > Default Applications\n  \n*Choose Google Chrome from the dropdown for Web\n  \n\n\nIf this is not working, then uninstall your chrome.

At the first launch, it will ask if you want to set Chrome as default browser. You can choose Yes then otherwise you can set it from System Settings > Details > Default Applications > Web.\n\nA: As I already answered earlier on this question:\nThere are a number of places an application might figure out which browser to launch and unfortunately there is no established standard.

I have recently switched from windows 7 to ubuntu 12.10.  In ubuntu 12.10 I am using putty to connect to a unix machine remotely where several of my files are stored but editing texts files through the command prompt is tedious in my opinion.  How can I configure putty to allow me to run xterms and in turn run software such as emacs (which is installed on the unix machine) to edit files on the unix machine from my ubuntu machine? \nIn windows an x server is needed such as xMing, is any additional software necessary?\n\nA: Do you really use Putty to connect from an Ubuntu machine to an Ubuntu server? This is a highly unusual choice, I wasn't even aware Putty runs on Linux (turns out it actually does and even is in Ubuntu repositories).\nA more conventional approach is to use ssh command from openssh-client package, which is a native implementation of a client for OpenSSH protocol. Install it with\nsudo apt-get install openssh-client\n\nThen you can connect to a remote machine with\nssh username@host.com\n\nIf you enable X11 forwarding with the -X switch, you'll be able to run applications on the remote machines and have them displayed on your local machine:\nssh -X username@host.com\n\nSince you are running an proper real X server, you don't need to run xMing or anything like that.\nAlthough, I agree that this is a solution for a strange problem - if you want to just edit text files, much more efficient options would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*find a text-mode editor which suits you. I personally prefer Midnight Commander's editor which you can run with mc -e myfile.txt.\n\n*somehow mount the remote directory and edit files in your local text editor (using sshfs) \n\n*in KDE you can directly open a file from a remote host in any program using fish:user@host/path/to/file.txt. I think Gnome also can do something similar\n\n*make a local copy of the files, edit local files and use rsync to upload the changes\n\n*use a version control system\n\nA: The server you are connecting to must also have the X libraries installed on it, as they will be a dependency for any graphical text editors and xterms you want to run. If it does, then you can connect to it from your Ubuntu box with the commandline:\nssh -X username@remotehost \n\nThen you can simply run the command you want. To start a graphical emacs session:\nxemacs filename\n\n\nA: You are correct that you will need to be running an X server like xMing locally.\nThe Putty connection settings allow you to turn on X forwarding when you connect. If you enable that and have a local X server running, then running graphical programs through the SSH connection should just work. See http://www.math.umn.edu/systems_guide/putty_xwin32.html\nKnow ahead of time that it's going to be slow. It can help to turn on compression in your connection settings too. I understand it can be tedious to edit text files remotely before you know a good text editor well - I highly recommend learning vi/vim if you plan on editing files on remote linux servers regularly.\nIf you definitely want a graphical environment, VNC is another option. You can install and run vncserver on the server and connect to it using a VNC client. While VNC still has a noticeable lag, it can be significantly better than forwarding X over an internet connection. VNC is optimized for use over a network, whereas X is not. If your server's firewall does not allow you to connect to the VNC port (ie. 5901), then you can use putty to set up a reverse SSH tunnel that forwards the VNC port to a port on your local windows machine that you can connect to.

I want to export my Tomboy notes to the Evernote web service, I have seen this web site but I don't want to send my Tomboy notes to an untrusted site where they may be put to unknown use.\nIs there any other way?\n\nA: The basic process seems to be export your Tomboy notes to html: Tools > Export\nThen use email to send the files into your Evernote account. Instructions for using email to import notes are here in this Evernote support article.\nThe notes themselves are stored as individual XML files in ~/.local/share/tomboy, so it's possible to convert them to whatever form you need through your own scripts if the Export doesn't provide exactly you what you need.\n\nA: Use Tomboy2Evernote exporter: https://github.com/rPawel/Tomboy2Evernote\nExports notes with links, colours & formatting straight to *.enex format file.\npython Tomboy2Evernote.py -i ~/.local/share/tomboy -o ~/Desktop\n\nOnce you have the exported notes, import them into Evernote: \n\nFile > Import > Evernote Export Files\n\n\nA: If you do not mind all of your notes on one page (items searchable by hyperlink) you can try this. \n\n\n*\n\n*Copy the following code into a text editor, save as script.py and run it in the folder where the Tomboy notes are kept. (Typically .local/share/tomboy/ in Linux). \nAt the command line, run python script.py:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n#\n#   This script creates a tomboy note containing link to each other note\n#   so one can easily export all the notes to an HTML file\n#\n#   author:Pedro\n#\n#   Check out lamehacks.net for more lame scripts and stuff\n\nimport dbus, time\n\nnote_title = \"Note Index\"\n\n# Get the D-Bus session bus\nbus = dbus.SessionBus()\n\n# Access the Tomboy D-Bus object\nobj = bus.get_object(\"org.gnome.Tomboy\",\"/org/gnome/Tomboy/RemoteControl\")\n\n# Access the Tomboy remote control interface\ntomboy = dbus.Interface(obj, \"org.gnome.Tomboy.RemoteControl\")\n\nnotes_links = \"\"\n\nfor note in tomboy.ListAllNotes():\nnotes_links += tomboy.GetNoteTitle(note) + \" \\n\"\n\nuri = tomboy.FindNote(note_title)\nif uri == \"\":\nuri = tomboy.CreateNamedNote(note_title)\n\ntomboy.SetNoteContents(uri, note_title + \"\\n\\n\" + notes_links)\ntomboy.DisplayNote(uri)\n\nThis will create an empty Tomboy note. \n\n*Then run this code at the command line, in the same folder where your Tomboy notes are stored:\nfor i in *.note; do\nxpath -q -e '/note/title' $i;\ndone \\ sed -r 's%^<title>(.*)</title>%\\1%g'\n\nThis will generate a list of titles. Copy and Paste those into the blank Tomboy\nnote created by the python script. Then export this note as a single HTML file. Send this file as an email attachment to your Evernote account. \n\nCode taken from Lamehacks Blog\n\nA: I wrote a Python script that simply parses .note files from the Tomboy dir and convertes them to .enex files, which can then be imported into Evernote via a desktop app:\nhttps://gist.github.com/scribu/7442170\n\nA: In the nixnote/nevernote package (a linux client for evernote), there is a contributed package called TomboyExporter (see TomboyExporter.tar.gz at http://sourceforge.net/projects/nevernote/files/Current/).\nI found it to be poorly documented, but once I figured out how to run it, it worked very well, with the exception of two issues: (1) hyperlinks are converted to plaintext (but underlined), (2) most underlined text (except when surrounded in italics, for example) is just lost, due to a bug. Otherwise, it does a good job at keeping formatting when possible, and it will also organize your notes into notebooks, keeping the same organizational structure you had in Tomboy (also preserves last-modified dates, etc.). It doesn't keep links to other notes, but that's asking a lot.\nTo use it, extract the .tar.gz package, then go to the src/ directory. Run like:\njava Exporter [desired output directory] ~/.local/share/tomboy/*note\nIt creates several .nnex file, one per notebook (so each file contains many notes). Then just import these from evernote.\n", "Q: Can't install 12.10 on a separate partition in a PC with Windows 7 I want to install ubuntu 12.10 along side with windows7, I have already installed win7,My Hard disk(600GB) contains 6 partitions.

I have successfully installed UBUNTU to an 8GB thumb drive. I would like to boot into the thumb drive the same way I do with a windows system except I would like to do this with my Android tablet. I only know how to boot into recovery mode with the tablet, but when I plug the USB drive into the tablet I do not see the option to boot into my tablet.\nWhat is the best route to take. \nthanks in advance.\n\nA: This is not possible. As Uri Herrera mentioned in the comments, since Ubuntu is not an ARM-based operating system, it cannot be run on ARM-based Android tablets like yours. You may have luck with finding an unofficial build of Ubuntu Mobile on the list. Although it may be possible if your tablet is x86-based but that is not common.\n\nA: look at this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0PNsnNe3E0\nIt isn't dual booting,and runs on top of Android And might be slower to run two oses but this is the quick and easy way to do it.\n\nA: I have an Acer A500 tablet, and I'm happy with it.

It's just a pre-configured Squid proxy very well capable of caching packages from Debian/Ubuntu repositories efficiently. You can use all the power of Squid with it too.\nFor Squid-deb-proxy, just install the package squid-deb-proxy and add allowed destination domains in a new file in /etc/squid-deb-proxy/mirror-dstdomain.acl.d. The regular official Ubuntu mirrors are already added for you (e.g. *.archive.ubuntu.com). It will run a HTTP proxy at port 8000 by default.\nAs a bonus, clients can auto-discover caching-enabled machines in the local network by having the squid-deb-proxy-client package installed.

Can I do this and how? I have a machine that I have updated online with a faster internet connection. I am now in a location where the connection speed is horrible. Can I move the files from the updated machine to the not updated one? Sorry I am new to Ubuntu. \n\nA: There is a piece of software which is intended for these situations. It is called Keryx\nIt permits you to download packages on a computer for installation on another.\n", "Q: How are key codes mapped to the appropriate action? After figuring out how to change the mapping of scan codes to key codes using udev, see this question, I was wondering how those key codes (or events if you will) are mapped to the appropriate action. \nSo, for example, if you press volume up on your keyboard, a scan code is sent which will then be converted to the volumeup key code. But how is this key code intercepted, the volume turned up, and the appropriate notification displayed?\nMy guess is that somewhere a script must be called, so I'd like to know where those scripts are. \nEDIT: The key codes I mention are not to be confused with the key codes xev returns, but I am also interested in those ;)\n\nA: Ok, found this at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MultimediaKeys\n\nWhen you hit a key on your keyboard, the linux kernel generates a raw\n  scancode for it (if it is assigned). Each scancode can be mapped to a\n  keycode. This is at kernel level. X has a (quasi) total independent\n  way of mapping keys: X reads the kernel keycode table at startup, then\n  maps the keycode to its independent keycode table (it is the same as\n  the kernel keycodes but different :)). Then each keycode can be mapped\n  to a keysym, i.e. a string which represent a key or suggest an action.\n  Thus to have our keys fully functional, they need a kernel\n  scancode/keycode plus a X keycode/keysym. It may seem weird, but X\n  developers have their reason to keep a separate keyboard mapping from\n  the kernel. It is not difficult at all, just a quite tedious\n  procedure.\n\nSo keycodes's are mapped to keysym's, So where are the keysym's? I found and answer from this question: Where do I find a list of all X keysyms these days? Since we are talking about the volume keys it would be found in XF86keysym.h in the source-code mentioned in the answer.\nIn that file on my computer I found the following for volume:\n#define XF86XK_AudioLowerVolume 0x1008FF11   /* Volume control down        */\n#define XF86XK_AudioMute    0x1008FF12   /* Mute sound from the system */\n#define XF86XK_AudioRaiseVolume 0x1008FF13   /* Volume control up          */\n\nStrange... different values from anything else, maybe there are multiple systems for handling keys? http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=16656\n\nI am using Xubuntu, and to control the keys, I need to map the actions manually(like this How do I change my keyboard shortcuts in xubuntu?). However the notifications seem independent as if they are picking up on the key-press and acting accordingly, It may mean that other programs in Ubuntu are set up this way, so there is no need to map scripts to the keys.\nSo I'm quite sure that programs are now picking up on the key (so no scrips to be found).\nIn Xubuntu I had this problem with Pulse Audio and using custom scripts for changing the volume, It seemed that Pulse was intercepting the Mute key, Mute key mutes Alsa and PulseAudio, but unmutes only Alsa made for interesting workarounds.\n\nCheck this out about NotifyOSD https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NotifyOSD#Volume_changes\nIf you look a These diagrams: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NotifyOSD#Architecture\nEspecially this one:\n\nIt shows that there is a \"hardware keys listener\" which receives form DBus or HAL?\nIt then \"retrieves visual element from system\" which the sound and brightness icons are in the source of Notify-OSD, and then makes the bubble from there.\n\nThis is all crazy confusing, but as far as I understand it (so far):\nraw scancode (ex. e016) > keycode (ex. 160) > keysym (ex. XF86AudioMute) > gnome-settings-daemon (ex. volume-up) > DBus signal > hardware-keys-listener for notify-osd (or other program listening)\n\nA: In most cases, there are no scripts that are run.  They cause events to be sent to the window manager or settings daemon.  The only time that I am aware of scripting in the process is when you configure custom key bindings.   For custom keybindings, you can add command lines (executables or scripts) and have them bound to keys.\nPlease see this answer that I wrote to a question about backing up keybindings in Ubuntu: Where are GNOME keyboard shortcuts stored?\nI have a script that backs up or restores all the keybindings, including the custom keybindings.  If you run the script, you can see where in dconf the keybindings are stored, and which application gets notified about the key event.\n\nA: The answer relates to Drivers.\nEvery hardware must have a driver in order to interact with the operating system.\nQuoting http://www.linuxforu.com/2010/11/understanding-linux-device-drivers/:\n\nA driver drives, manages, controls, directs and monitors the entity under its command. What a bus driver does with a bus, a device driver does with a computer device (any piece of hardware connected to a computer) like a mouse, keyboard, monitor, hard disk, Web-camera, clock, and more.\nFurther, a “pilot” could be a person or even an automatic system monitored by a person (an auto-pilot system in airliners, for example). Similarly, a specific piece of hardware could be controlled by a piece of software (a device driver), or could be controlled by another hardware device, which in turn could be managed by a software device driver. In the latter case, such a controlling device is commonly called a device controller. This, being a device itself, often also needs a driver, which is commonly referred to as a bus driver.\n\nA device has a device register which stores the Control/Status bits and Data bits. Whenever some data needs to be transferred it is usually sent by setting the Data bits.\nSo, whenever you press some key on your keyboard, some data is written on the register. Those bits are read by the device driver and appropriate action is performed. This is the short explanation.\nLinks:\n\n*\n\n*If you are interested, I'd recommend that you read this series on Device Drivers consisting of 17 well-written articles by linuxforu: http://www.linuxforu.com/tag/linux-device-drivers-series/.\n\n\n*You can read the specific document containing instructions on how to write a device driver for USB keyboard: http://www.emntech.com/docs/USB_KeyBoard_Driver_eMNTech.pdf\n\n\n*If you're very much excited about linux device drivers, read the book \"Linux Device Drivers\" which is available as pdf for free: http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on an empty 30GB Windows 7 formatted partition I want to install Ubuntu on an empty 30GB Windows 7 formatted partition.\nIf I understand correctly, it will not recognize the NTFS file system.\nSo should I delete that partition, then create new unformatted partition? Do I wipe it completely clean (so there are no files on it)?\nThe Windows installer that I downloaded is a .tar file, so how can I run it with no OS on that partition?\nWhen I finally get it installed, it will make the needed partition, right?\nOr... do I run the .tar from my current Windows desktop, then install it to the freshly \"un-partitioned\" drive?\nI am using Windows Home Premium7 sp1\nAMD E-300 APU with Radeon (tm) HD Graphics 1.30, 4GB RAM, 64GB OS\nI want to get this right the first time. I am hoping for step-by-step instructions.\n\nA: All Linuxes recognise practically all file systems however you will need to delete the 30GB partition in Win7. Otherwise there may be a problem within Win7.\nDownload whichever Linux you want to install; Ubuntu 12.10 is good, once you have made a few minor changes to it. Look at the instructions on the website; once downloaded you can load from inside running Win7, or boot it from a USB or CD. For the latter you may have to go into boot device selection at boot up time (F8 for my mobo).\nThe loading is absolutely straight forward for Ubuntu, with a few things to select but not much. The most important thing is get the right area on the disc, the blank bit, not your Win7! This is a specification right at the beginning of the process.\nIt may suggest that you load Ubuntu into the Win7 partition but you don't actually want that. You want to specify the 30GB area, also specify a separate SWAP partition, equal in size to your RAM, or 2Gb, whichever is the smaller. You do not format the swap partition but you do format the Ubuntu partition into EXT4.\nOnce you have the swap and the Ubuntu partition, it will load itself into what remains of your 30GB. The new bootloader will recognise Win7 and Ubuntu (and anything else) and needs to be installed into the Disk MBR (master boot record).\nFrom now on the boot menu will have Ubuntu as default, plus an optional Win7. You can change this arrangement at will in Ubuntu using Grub Customiser.\nThe MBR is now controlled from the Ubuntu partition. If you load Win7 again, it will over-write the MBR and you will have lost your way into Ubuntu. Don't panic: you can go through the motions of re-loading Ubuntu and the MBR will reset itself.\nWindows recognises no other OS and must be installed on first partition. You pays your money and gets no choice. Linux is much more flexible.\nIn the unlikely event of you running out of primary partitions (4 maximum), you will have to extend the partitions using primary partition 4. Win7 only recognises primary partitions - up to a certain point; it will not be able to read the Ubuntu partitions, although SWAP is not readable anyway! Ubuntu will be able to read all other partitions, once they are \"mounted\".\nEnjoy!\n", "Q: How to migrate from RAIDZ1 to RAIDZ2 using ZFS-native?

How do I tell to the package manager -- that I actually would rather use pyc or even better -- pyo files?\n\nA: You already have them and you're already using them\nWell-packaged Python applications are being compiled to .pyc files in a script run after installation of the files has taken place. This is needed according to the packaging guidelines to be able to adopt to the Python installation you're using at that moment. Do remember that .pyc files are very specific to your system (Python version and dependencies).\nAll .pyo and .pyc files are therefore specifically excluded in packages and tagged as errors by Lintian:\n\nCompiled python source files must not be included in the package. These files should be removed from the package and created at package installation time in the postinst.\nRefer to Debian Python Policy section 2.6 (Modules Byte-Compilation) for details.\nSeverity: serious, Certainty: certain\n\nIn the case of python-numpy this post-install byte-compilation is handled by the debhelper hook of pycentral.

Whenever a user starts the application, the Python interpreter can read the .py files, but it can't write to the directories (e.g. /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/). This is part of general security in all Linux systems; users shouldn't write to /usr, only with root rights this should be possible. For this reason, the APT hooks will compile the Python files for you at installation time; firstly to minimize the package size, secondly to be able to retrigger the hooks once something changes on your system regarding Python, because it's required to recompile when they get incompatible during upgrades for example.\nThis won't, however, affect regular user-owned python files being compiled at runtime.\n", "Q: Can't get bootloader to work using easyBCD When rebooting the computer, only Windows 8 will be visible in bootloader.\n\n\n*\n\n*Computer: HP Envy 17\n\n*OS 1: Ubuntu 12.10 32 bit\n\n*OS 2: Windows 8 64 bit\n\n\nDisk partitions on system:\n(data from windows disk management)\n\nDisk 1 is a SSD\n**Disk 0 Dynamic 596,17 GB**\nVolum: SYSTEM, type: dynamic, filesystem: NTFS, status: ok (system), capacity: 199 MB\nVolum: (D:), type: dynamic, filesystem: NTFS, status: ok, capacity: 595,97 GB\n\n**Disk 1 Default 223,57 GB**\nVolum: SYSTEM (M:), type: default, filesystem: NTFS, status: ok (active, primary partition), capacity: 199 MB\nVolum: (C:), type: default, filesystem: NTFS, status: ok (startup, primary partition), capacity: 166,42 GB\nVolum: , type: default, filesystem: , status: ok (primary partition), capacity: 51,00 GB\nVolum: , type: default, filesystem: , status: ok (primary partition), capacity: 5,95 GB\n\nUbuntu is installed on the 51,00 GB partition.\nWindows is istalled on the 166,42 GB partition (C:).\nPasted from easyBCD:\nThere are a total of 2 entries listed in the bootloader.\nDefault: Windows 8\nTimeout: 5 seconds\n\nEasyBCD Boot Device: D:\\\n\nEntry #1\nName: Windows 8\nBCD ID: {current}\nDrive: C:\\\nBootloader Path: \\Windows\\system32\\winload.exe\n\nEntry #2\nName: NeoSmart Linux\nBCD ID: {f3b2e917-5e47-11e2-be84-cc52af78aa22}\nDevice: Unknown\nBootloader Path: \\NST\\AutoNeoGrub0.mbr\n\n\nA: In my opinion, I'd like to suggest you UNetbootin.

This is my current messaging menu layout in Ubuntu 12.10:\n\nI was wondering is there a way to change the list? I would rather have Thunderbird moved to the bottom.

It seems the layout is set as you set-up the applications the first time which made me think there is something somewhere which defines how they are ordered in the list.\nAny help would be great!\n\nA: Well, I found an easy way.\nOpen Dconf Editor, go to com > canonical > indicator > messages. You can change the order of applications there or even remove something.\n\nThen, you should restart unity to changes take effect. So simply logout and login again, or press Alt+F2 and run unity --replace.

Many times, I can only remember the folder's name not\nthe file names. Thank you for your help.\n\nA: Don't use recoll for that. recoll is for searching based on file content. It builds and index of your files so that you can then run full text searches on the content of your computer.\nBy definition, this doesn't apply to directories at all. (You can search based on files names with recoll too if you go to: Tools -> Advanced Search -> File name matching. Don't know how to restrict that to directories, though )\nWhat you want to do is use a simpler method, such as find (CLI), locate, (CLI) or the searching utility that's integrated into nautilus (pops up when you press CTRL+F). These do not look inside your files/directiories but only search for files/directiories based on their names.\nI don't think you can specify 'directories only' with locate and nautilus's search, but you can certainly do that with find (though it will probably be somewhat slower, as find doesn't build a database for faster searches).\nTry (in the command line)\nfind $STARTING_POINT -name $QUOTED_WILDCARD_EXPRESSION_TO_SEARCH_FOR -type d\n(type d means type=directory)\nOR use nautilus search and have the results listed by type (so that you can select directories only).\nYou can start looking for something better if none of these method is fast enough for you (if you want to run searches on a very large set of directories).\n\nA: While I agree with the previous answer (recoll not the best tool for file searches), and for the record, you can filter answers for being directories only by using the query language with a mime specification of application/x-fsdirectory. For example searching for a directory with \"bin\" in the name would be:\nfile:bin mime:application/x-fsdirectory\nThis would return results such as bin or cgi-bin\n\nA: Searching with the Qt graphical user interface\nrecoll has two search modes:\nSimple search (the default, on the main screen) has a single entry field where you can enter multiple words.\nAdvanced search (a panel accessed through the Tools menu or the toolbox bar icon) has multiple entry fields, which you may use to build a logical condition, with additional filtering on file type, location in the file system, modification date, and size.\nTry simple seach:\nmime:inode/directory\n", "Q: Where did this \"nonexistant\" directory come from and what should I do with it?

Then I bought a copy of Windows XP and tried to install it, replacing one OS for another.  \nI have followed the advice given in many other similar questions of this site to create the correct type of partition to install XP along side Ubuntu. \nEvery time I tried installing XP, it gave me the blue-screen and indicated that the hard drive was corrupted.\nThe upshot is I now require to GRUB rescue to get the PC started up as it won't boot, or boot up from the original installation USB. \nIs there anyone able to help me with the process of getting the PC up and running again Ubuntu and/or be able to install XP?\n\nA: First of all, are you sure it's Windows XP? Second, if so, why did you go with Windows XP and not at least Windows 7? If possible, I recommend exchanging your Windows copy for a new one, because XP has already reached the end of its mainstream support cycle, and will be completely end of lifed in just over a year. You'll also be unable to leverage a good portion of the technology on your son's brand new computer unless you're running a modern operating system.\nThat said, typically, the blue screen of death indicates a hardware problem. I recommend the following to ensure there's not a hardware issue, first (if you're not comfortable dealing with the hardware, take it to someone who is; ideally, the person who built it for you):\n\n\n*\n\n*Reseat the graphics card and memory\n\n*Reseat the cables to the hard drive (both on the motherboard side and the hard drive side)\n\n*Run a hardware check on both the hard drive and the memory (I recommend Hitachi's Drive Fitness Tes for the hard drive and Memtest for the memory)\n\n\nDoing the above will rule out any hardware-related issues.\nIf you're still having problems, then you can try the following:\nIf you want to install Ubuntu and Windows side by side\nI recommend installing Windows, first. Buy a Windows 7 or Windows 8 installation disk and try it. If you're still getting the blue screen of death, then try Darik's Boot And Nuke to wipe the hard drive completely clean, so the installation disk doesn't freak out (in a working system, the installer won't care what the format of the hard drive is, but Windows can't read the default Linux filesystems, so it will come back as \"unknown\" or see it as blank). Be sure to tell Windows to only use part of the hard drive, so you don't have to resize the partitions later.\nOnce you've installed Windows, you can boot into the Ubuntu installer. It should detect the presence of the Windows install and give you the option to install Ubuntu next to Windows, in the available nonpartitioned space. Once you install Ubuntu, you will be able to choose which one to boot into on startup.\nIf you want to install only one or the other\nSimply follow the instructions above for the one you want to install. In this situation, though, just use the whole disk.\nVideo drivers in Linux\nWithout any information, I can only speak in generalities with regard to your graphic card issues. That said, here's what I know about graphics cards in Linux:\n\n\n*\n\n*(If you have an Nvidia card) Nvidia provides proprietary graphics drivers and display manager. To install the proprietary driver, simply go to \"Software Sources\" by opening the Unity dash (using the Ubuntu logo in the top left of the screen, or by pressing the \"Windows\"/Super key) and type in \"Software Sources\". Then, go to the \"Additional Drivers\" tab and choose a graphics driver to install (I recommend the one marked \"proprietary, tested\"). Once you've finished the installation, you may need to change your resolution. To do that, open the Unity dash and start typing \"Nvidia\". It will find the display manager. Open it and find the \"X Server Settings\" in the list and adjust your screen resolution as necessary (use \"Apply\" to test your settings). Once done, click \"Save to X Configuration\" to make the changes permanent.\n\n*(If you have an ATI/AMD card) ATI/AMD provides proprietary graphics drivers and Catalyst. Go to ATI's website and select your card and for the OS select \"Linux x86\" (if you installed Ubuntu 32bit) or \"Linux x86_64\" (if you installed Ubuntu 64bit). If you don't know whether you installed 32 or 64 bit, you can check in the \"System Properties\". Just download the package from the ATI website and install it like you would on Windows.\n\n\nA: What you need to do is a clean install Windows XP. \nDelete all partitions and create a new one in the unpartitioned space. Format it to NTFS and this should format the disk completely and therefore remove Ubuntu.\n", "Q: is it possible to restore MS Word 2010 file by using a .lnk file? I have ubuntu 12.10, and use MS office 2010 to write documents. I have been writing and saving a file but when I went to open it today to was nowhere to be seen. Not in the the  rubbish bin and when in Word it is listed in recent documents but can't be found. \nAfter doing a full system search, I have found 71 .lnk files for the document. Therefore does anyone no if it is possible to restore the file? or can I use the .lnk files to do this? or are there any other ways to search the hard dive for the file, which I guess I have saved 71 times!\n\nA: .lnk files are shortcuts to other files, they simply contain a reference, and some other options. You cannot use them to recover the data of the original file.\n\nA: \"or are there any other ways to search the hard dive for the file\" --> Yes, there are.\nFirst look into your litterbasket, maybe the file is there.\nSecondly look out for files with the same name but with strange or missing extension. Linux doesn't need the file extension an it could have been lost while saving.\nAs Flimm already stated, the .lnk files normally don't contain any content, but only information about the location of the original file. But it could have happend somehow, that the originl file has got erroneously the extension .lnk, so check for the filesize of these. Normal .lnk files are quite small, whereas your word file is probably somehow bigger. If so, rename it so word can open it again.\nThirdly do a search without specifying filename or extension but give some distinctive phrases or words from the text of your file (search file contents)\nBe aware, that linux may have produced a backup copy of your file extended by a tilde (swung dash), which are normally invisible in some filemanagers. Activate view of hidden files and look for a file of the expected name ending with a tilde.\nFinally: Use an internet serarch engine with the terms file recovery, which shows you a bunch of programs which will hopefully quarry your missing file. Avoid any saving and writing to your harddisk before using the programs. The less you write, the better are your chances to recover the file in case it has been deleted. \nNot to forget: you will not find the file if you changed its permissions accidently. So be aware to perform your search with permisson to read files of all users (including root) on your system.\nLook for unmounted drives. Your file could be stored there and will be only acessable when mounting the drive.\n", "Q: Vista won't boot. I don't have the installation disk with me, can I install Ubuntu to access my files even though vista won't boot? I have managed to access my files with the demo but I'd like the full version. If I install Ubuntu while my vista OS isn't working will I lose my files?\n\nA: I would boot to the live CD and back up the files from Vista onto a separate drive.  Then do a full Ubuntu install and try to forget Vista ever existed.\n\nA: When dynamically resizing partitions (especially shrinking), as usually happens when you install Ubuntu alongside Windows, there is always a small but significant risk of data loss. So if there are no backups, this is not a good way to access the data.\nThe same CD/DVD/USB that you boot from to install Ubuntu can first be used to access and back up any documents and other important files. Just select Try Ubuntu instead of Install Ubuntu. You'll get a working Ubuntu desktop which you can use to access files in the broken Windows system.\nTo back up your data files, don't put them on the live environment's desktop -- files written to the Ubuntu live CD/DVD/USB environment exist in memory only and disappear when the system shuts down or reboots. Instead, put them on an external drive (not the one you booted from), burn them to a CD/DVD, email them to yourself, transfer them over the network to another machine (Ubuntu supports networked file sharing with Windows machines), or use a cloud storage service like DropBox or Ubuntu One ... just make sure your files are somewhere safe.\nNow that you've done that, unless you intend to attempt recovery or reinstallation of the broken Windows system, you can simply install Ubuntu and tell the installer to use the entire disk, overwriting the old Windows system.\nYou Try Ubuntu, you don't have to reboot to start the installation -- when you're done backing up your files, just run the Ubuntu installer by double-clicking the Install Ubuntu icon on the desktop.\n\nA: You will keep your files, as long as you don't format your hard disk. Choose the option to install Ubuntu alongside Windows.\n", "Q: How can I go back to GIMP 2.6? On an old PC, I have Lubuntu 12.10. during GIMP installation, the newest version was installed (ver. 2.8), but I think its a little heavy for an old machine like mine with a poor Intel Celeron CPU (Ram 1GB, VGA 128)\nHow can I go back to GIMP 2.6?\n\nA: Try doing the forward port approach (works for more packages than just Gimp):\n\n\n*\n\n*Add the precise main repositories to your system.\nCreate a file like /etc/apt/sources.list.d/precise-for-gimp.list containing\ndeb http://nl.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise main restricted\ndeb-src http://nl.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise main restricted\ndeb http://nl.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates main restricted\ndeb-src http://nl.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates main restricted\ndeb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise-security main restricted\ndeb-src http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu precise-security main restricted\n\nReplace the mirror (here nl.archive.ubuntu.com) with the one you would like to use.\n\n*Add a file with the appropriate pinning to allow downgrading of a certain set of packages, in e.g. /etc/apt/preferences.d/10-pin-gimp-to-precise:\nPackage: *gimp*\nPin: release a=precise-security\nPin-Priority: 1001\n\nPackage: *gimp*\nPin: release a=precise-updates\nPin-Priority: 1001\n\n\n*Run sudo apt-get update\n\n*Run sudo apt-get -s install gimp (-s to simulate only)\n\n*Check whether the output makes sense. If not, and it can't manage to satisfy the dependencies, then consider reverting the actions above. If it does work, then actually run the actions to be performed by re-running the previous command without the -s option.\nThis approach will provide you best flexibility and security-update support, as it's just using the repositories rather than a specific version. It may be a PITA to set up, though.\n\nA: You can also simply download gimp 2.6 from ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gimp/v2.6/ and run\n  tar xvfz gimp-2.6.x.tar.gz   # unpack the sources\n  cd gimp-2.6.x                # change to the toplevel directory\n  ./configure                  # run the `configure' script\n  make                         # build GIMP\n  make install                 # install GIMP\n\nYou can change the v2.6 in the url to change the version.\nTo first uninstall gimp:\nsudo apt-get remove gimp\n\n\nA: Try this (it worked for me):\nsudo apt-get install ppa-purge\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:otto-kesselgulasch/gimp\nsudo apt-get install gimp\n\n", "Q: Firefox, touchpad middle-button, open in new tab, lenovo T60 I use Firefox 18.0 with Xubuntu 12.04 on a lenovo Laptop T60. \nI like to use the middle button above the touchpad to do a middle-click on a link to open that page in a new tab.

I'm sorry and provide a self-answer, if maybe this hardware problem is not too rare. Since refurbished Thinkpads are quite common, it might be helpful for others. \n\nA: Middle button on a ThinkPad has two modes of action: middle click and scroll with trackpoint.\nClicking middle button quickly causes a middle click action while holding it down and using the trackpoint allows you to scroll whatever is under the cursor.\nThis is a hardware feature and requires no support from OS.\n", "Q: Kubuntu or Ubuntu with KDE?

Lubuntu and Xubuntu are two different things - Lubuntu uses the LXDE environment, while Xubuntu uses XFCE, (and vanilla Ubuntu uses Gnome, Kubuntu KDE, etc).\nXFCE is known for its low system requirements and ability to run well on systems such as yours. Xubuntu has been tuned and refined for running XFCE on Ubuntu (integration, theming, etc).\nAlternatively, you could pick up Ubuntu Server edition (which is largely just a headless insall of Ubuntu) and install the window manager of your choice, such as Rat Poison or one of the *box family (Openbox, Fluxbox, Blackbox), all of which are also known for being extremely lightweight.

You will need a Windows repair disc or installation disc or some other similar disc to fix your MBR.\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a Windows repair disc. Boot Windows, search for System Repair Disc. Follow instructions.\n\n*Boot Ubuntu and backup your files on the Linux partition if there's anything you do not want to loose.\n\n*Boot from the repair disc. Choose the command prompt option and run bootrec /fixmbr and bootrec /fixboot. At this point Ubuntu is no longer bootle even though everything is there except the bootloader.\n\n*Reboot your PC. It should boot directly into Windows.\n\n*Recover the space occupied by the Ubuntu partions. Right-click My Computer select Manage, then Disk Management. Delete the Ubuntu partitions (main and swap). Then, either create a new partition in their place or enlarge your current partition. What is possible and how you do this depends on your current partition table.

While this is probably just a simple hard drive with a partition table and a file system on it directly, it's still important to not misalign it.\nWhat about alignment?\nSuppose your hard drive works with 4 kB sectors (yours appear to work with 512 bytes) and you've aligned the partition to start with just a single byte offset, then updating a single 4 kB file system page will amplify to a two-sector write on your disk. With just 4 kB becoming 8 kB, this is not a great deal, but on larger systems or RAID setups this will become a real problem once the stripe size (block size) becomes hundreds of kilobytes or even megabytes. Once misaligned on this stripe size, this could amplify an unlucky 4 kB filesystem block to a 2x block size (e.g. 2 MB) write to disks, also impacting parity calculations (if any).\nSSD and other flash memory based drives are affected even worse. Usually, these drives are using huge page sizes. I've seen 512 kB \"sector\" sized USB flash drives out there and this is a common size for SSD drives IIRC. A misalignment when using multiple layers on top of it (e.g. dm-crypt, LVM, file system) could result in a huge write amplification (on top of what they already have) you really want to avoid unnecessary wear of the drive.\nWhy this gap on my drive then?\nMost recent utilities just use 1 MB alignment on the disk as a safe default. It is a lowest common denominator for common set ups, avoiding most misalignments while not losing too much space.\nGaining 766 kB on 1 TB is not worth the performance impact it would impose.\nCan I fix this?\nYes, you can, you'll have to look into the specification of your drive, the block size of your file system and figure out the proper alignment yourself and then fixing the partition table yourself. It's kinda dangerous to do this, though.\nIn your case sda5 is probably misaligned (beginning) and I would move the sda5 to proper alignment on an occasion that would suit me (backing up data first!).\n", "Q: How can I prevent web apps from appearing in the launcher (waste of launcher space)? Every time I go to Amazon website, an extra launcher icon gets created in my launcher as long as I'm on the Amazon website. How can I prevent this icon from appearing in the launcher?

And therefor you might not have the option to boot into anything but windows after the install.\nThough this should be rather easily fixed by reinstalling the GRUB from a Ubuntu live medium (dvd or usb).\nThere might be other challenges which I am not currently aware of.\n\nA: Windows assumes it is the only operating system on the machine. In all releases up to and including XP, it would overwrite the boot loader.  \nI suggest using clonezilla to clone the drive before updating.

I have removed Grub Customizer using Synaptic Package Manager with \"Mark for Complete Removal\" and then installed again. Still no change. 27 items remain in Grub Customizer Trash.\nCan I remove them?\n\nA: It is theoretically possible to empty GC Trash but you would be wasting your time.\nThe clever thing about Grub is that it is able to set itself up, by reading the available data on the disks. It does not require any configuration input as such.\nTherefore if you were to empty the Trash, it would immediately reappear back on the main grub boot menu. The fact that these entries are in Trash, means that they will NOT reappear!\nHaving said all that, I am no expert, so it may be possible to permanently remove various options from the initial setup file - but this is a risky business and unnecessary.\nAlso any new Ubuntu version would re-instate all the previous options again.\n", "Q: Media not found message When are you going to fix the media not found message when trying to mount a diskette.

What steps should I remember while installing Ubuntu?\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of filesystems like ext4, NTFS, and btrfs in this situation?\nContext:\nI have 320GB hard disk.  I have only one C drive. I will be shrinking the C drive and alloting 50GB for Ubuntu and installing Ubuntu in it.\n\nA: Windows can read and write to NTFS and FAT, with some support for other filesystems if you install the appropriate software. Ubuntu, on the other, can read and write to ext2, ext3, ext4, NTFS, and FAT.\nSo that means that out-of-the-box Windows and Ubuntu only have NTFS and FAT as filesystems in common. FAT is not good enough for Ubuntu, as it doesn't keep file permissions, and it's quite old and limited any way. NTFS is also not good enough for Ubuntu. Although it supports case-sensitive filenames, it does not support UNIX-like file permissions. This rules out installing Ubuntu on an NTFS filesystem (see this question).\nThat just leaves these options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the NTFS or FAT partition devoted to Windows to keep the files you want to share between Ubuntu and Windows.\n\n*Create a third partition formatted as NTFS with no operating system, solely devoted to storing the files you want to share between Ubuntu and Windows.\n\n*Install some software to allow Windows to read the filesystem used by your Ubuntu installation (such as ext4). There are several ways to do this, and none of them are straight-forward.\n\nA: When you are \"shrinking the C drive\", shrink it further, and create a second NTFS partition for all your data files.  This \"D drive\" will be available in both Windows and Linux so that you can use precisely the same data files in both systems.\n", "Q: How can I get Ubuntu to work alongside windows 8? \nPossible Duplicate:\nInstalling Ubuntu on a Pre-Installed UEFI Supported Windows 8 system \n\nI'm not really good with computers, so I have no idea what's going on.

Why is this happening? I basically want to read the access log to see if squid-deb-proxy server is getting requests from client or not.\n\nA: To view the permissions of a directory, you need to pass the -d flag to ls, like this:\nls -ld squid3\n\nTo read a file, its read permission needs to be set. However, to read a directory and the listing of its files, both the read and the execute permissions need to be set. If they aren't, you get weird errors like the ones you're experiencing.\nTo set the read permission on files and the read and execute permissions on directories recursively, use this command:\nchmod -R a+rX directoryname\n\nHere's an explanation of that command:\n\n*\n\n*chmod is the name of the command, use for changing the permissions of files.\n\n*-R is the recursive flag. It means apply this command to the directory, and all of its children, and of its children's children, and so on.\n\n*a stands for all: apply these permissions the owner of the file, the group owner of the file, and all other users.\n\n*+ means add the following permissions if they aren't set already.\n\n*r means the read permission.\n\n*X means the execute permission, but only on directories. Lower-case x would mean the execute permission on both files and directories.\n\nMore information is found in the manpage for the chmod command .\n\nA: I had this problem too.  I couldn't do chmod or chown on the file.\nI had tried to delete it.  It turns out that trying to delete it (rm command) caused the problem.  The kicker is that the file is shared between two different systems.  Once I closed the file in the other system, the file disappeared.\nHere's more details of my configuration.\nsystem 1: Ubuntu guest VM.  This is where I did the rm command.\nsystem 2: Windows 7 host.  This is where I had opened the file using the less command (in cygwin, not that it's necessarily relevant).\n\nA: As you stated that your goal is to read /var/log/squid/access.log, your best solution is to type sudo less /var/log/squid/access.log, which spares the trouble of repeatedly chmodding.\n", "Q: Ubuntu won't do 1920x1080 Both my monitors (one over DVI other over HDMI) have a native resolution of 1920x1080 (16:9) but the only two options for resolution in the \"Display\" section of system settings are 800x600 (4:3) and 1024x768 (4:3).\nThe \"additional drivers\" tab in the \"Software Sources\" section of system settings tells me I have no drivers running, despite installing NVidia drivers multiple times. \nI downloaded and installed Jockey from the Software Centre, which told me that I am running the NVidia driver. Since closing Jockey I am unable to find any trace of it in my system. I can't open it in Terminal either. When I search \"nvidia\" in the dash, I get \"NVidia X Server Settings\" and in there as well I have the same resolution options as in \"Display\" settings.\nAdditional information: With only one monitor, the issue persists.

Could you please help... not shutting Ubuntu down till I get it right.. ;)\n\nA: Windows is not added for a Wubi install. Wubi boots via the Windows Boot Manager already so trying to get grub to load Windows by default is pointless (it just takes you back to the Windows Boot Manager).\nNote if you did get Grub to boot Windows (it's possible), and set Ubuntu as the default in the Windows Boot Manager, they'll just keep going from one boot menu to the other. If you did this and also set the Time to display operating systems in the Windows Boot Manager to 0, then Windows cannot boot. That's the reason Windows was removed from the Grub menu for all Wubi installs.\nOne important thing that's not always clear with Wubi: the first time you install Wubi it sets a flag in the Windows boot manager to go straight to Ubuntu without prompting. This makes some people think that Ubuntu has taken over. That's not the case. Simply reboot and you'll be prompted to choose between Windows and Ubuntu. That might be what happened here.\n", "Q: Locking keyboard, mouse and CDROM for baby I use laptop and need to use keyboard between baby activities...\nIs there any software for ubuntu that does all these things by pressing just one key (or predefined combination/password)?\nI tried program lk4b but it does not locks CD and mouse, this is unsufficient for my baby...\nAlso how can i disable power button?\n\nA: \nhow can i disable power button?\n\nYou'll need hardware support for that.

I am wondering why chrome close/maximize buttons are aligned to the left while all the buttons are aligned to the right. The truth is that the chrome buttons are right aligned too when in the chrome settings I tick \"use system title bar and borders\". But since I dont want the borders, I unticked this option and the buttons got aligned to the other (left-hand) side.\nDoes anyone know why this is? By the way, I am using cinnamon interface on Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: In the settings from Google Chrome, in Appearance, you have to choose GTK+theme.\nYou also have to enable 'Use system title bar and borders.'\nTo make it work, you have to logout, and login. \nNow you can test it with the Unity Tweak Tool (You can download that program from the Ubuntu Software Center). \nIn Unity Tweak Tool, choose Window Controls. Change Alignment from Left to Right, or from Right to Left. The title bar form Google Chrome will change immediately.\nThe reason why it works, I guess, is because by default Google Chrome doesn't call the gtk-window-decorator that comes with the Compiz window manager. If you install the CompizConfig Settings Manager (from the Ubuntu Software Center), you will see that the Windows Decoration module uses the program /usr/bin/gtk-window-decorator.\nSo, this works problaby only when you're running a default Ubuntu 13.04 setup. That means: the Compiz window manager and a GTK+ enabled theme (Ambiance for example).\n\nA: Chrome draws its own buttons rather than letting the OS do it.  There is a setting that allows it to use native window titlebars, but this isn't the most elegant solution to the problem because you lose the benefit (when windowed) of Chrome not having extra space for the titlebar.\nChrome guesses which side to put the buttons on based on various Gnome-related settings, but this doesn't always work properly with Ubuntu's Unity interface.\nThis article tells how to move them to the desired side.  Note that if you sometimes use Gnome-shell rather than Unity, this has the potential to affect how all title bars appear in your Gnome-shell sessions.\nTo quote:\n\nTo move window buttons of Google Chrome to the right under Ubuntu 12.10 or older, open the terminal and issue this command:\ngconftool-2 --set /apps/metacity/general/button_layout --type string \":minimize,maximize,close\"\n\n\n\nA: Choose The GTK+ Theme in chrome Just right click on the title bar and choose GTK+ Theme.\n", "Q: Prevent screen turning off when watching video in XBMC In 12.04, the screen never went to sleep while watching videos in XBMC.  However after upgrading to 12.10 and changing no settings, it does.\nIs there any way I can prevent the screen automatically turning off while playing a video in XBMC, without actually disabling the screen from turning off at other times?\nIdeally, is there a XBMC specific setting for this?  Was this a feature of XBMC that is now somehow broken in 12.10 or has this changed due to some other non-XBMC change within Ubuntu?\n\nA: A very simple solution is caffeine. Caffeine is a 'status bar application able to temporarily prevent the activation of both the screensaver and the \"sleep\" powersaving mode.'\nEnabling it is as easy as clicking the status bar indicator, but you can also set it up such that it automatically disables the screensaver when you start xbmc. See the screenshot below\n\nIf you're using Gnome you can install the caffeine gnome extension. If not, for Ubuntu up to 15.04 (vivid) you can install caffeine from the launchpad ppa:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:caffeine-developers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install caffeine\n\nfrom 15.10 onwards you can install without ppa\nsudo apt install caffeine\n\nEnjoy!\n\nA: This seems to be a bug in the XBMC package for ubuntu\nI'm not sure what version you have installed, but the version from the PPA* doesn't seem to have it on my system.

Find the following lines in the above script:\nwhile true; do\n  if [[ $(pidof xbmc.bin | wc -w) -gt 0 ]]; then\n    while [[ $(pidof xbmc.bin | wc -w) -gt 0 ]]; do\n\nAnd replace xbmc.bin in both lines 2 and 3 with the process name of your choice.\n\nHow to find the process name\n\n\n*\n\n*With GUI (GNOME):\nWe can use System Monitor to find the name of the process. Press Super to open Dash and query for \"System Monitor\" to launch it. In the Processes Tab, we can find the Process Name as the first column.\n\n\n*With Terminal:\nWe can run top to list all the running processes. The last column called Command gives us the name of the Process (however it is limited to first 15 characters).\n\nHere we can see that Firefox is just named as firefox. So, if we want this behavior when Firefox is running; we would replace xbmc.bin in the script with firefox and everything else would work just fine.\n\nAcknowledgement: I had found the script here. However, I have made necessary modifications to make it compact and satisfy the demands of the question.\n\nA: I use these in ~/bin/:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# ssoff - disable screensaver and power mgmt\npkill xscreensaver\nxset s 0\nxset -dpms\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# sson - activate screen and power mgmt\nxscreensaver > /dev/null 2>&1 &\nxset s 100\nxset +dpms\n\nof course you can make an icon to run these but I don't use XBMC either\n\nA: These solutions all turn the screensaver off whenever xbmc is running, not just when it's playing videos.  As it has a built-in UPnP server, I leave it running 24/7 but I only want to disable the screensaver when a video is being played locally.\nHere's what I came up with: turn on http and JSON support in XBMC.  Then loop making a request to find out whether the player is active or not.  If it is, issue an xscreensaver-command -disable (you can adjust this per your screensaver).  If not, do nothing.  Checking every 50 seconds is plenty for me.  \nPython code here: http://sumnerhayes.com/software/\n", "Q: HP 8510p notebok overheating with ubuntu I've recently instaled ubuntu 12.10 on my notebook and noticed that it starts overheating after a few minutes of simple usage having only for example a browser opened or reading a pdf so nothing procesor intentsive.\nI've tried also with xubuntu desctop thinking that it would be more lightweight, but with no success.\nI have a core2duo intel porcesor and ati radeon 2600HD graphic card.\nI've also tried to install the proprietary drivers for the graphic card but no success, when I install drivers and login the menu is gone in unity\nDo I have any chanses to stop this overheating...any hints?\nI'm pasting the sensors output : \nAdapter: Virtual device\ntemp1:        +71.0°C  (crit = +105.0°C)\ntemp2:        +45.0°C  (crit = +105.0°C)\ntemp3:        +26.8°C  (crit = +105.0°C)\ntemp4:        +75.0°C  (crit = +110.0°C)\ntemp5:        +55.0°C  (crit = +256.0°C)\ntemp6:        +45.0°C  (crit = +105.0°C)\n\ncoretemp-isa-0000\nAdapter: ISA adapter\nCore 0:       +49.0°C  (high = +100.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\nCore 1:       +47.0°C  (high = +100.0°C, crit = +100.0°C)\n\nradeon-pci-0100\nAdapter: PCI adapter\ntemp1:        +51.0°C  \n\nthe temp1 and temp4 are problematic, temp4 sometimes goes as far as 100%\nAnyway how can I find out what temp1 and tem4 are refered to?

I've had updates take up to 1 hour on my netbook with 7 before, and I know of people who have had much longer.\n\nA: You can't usually install drivers for real hardware in a Virtual Machine.\nWindows 7, when installed under VirtualBox can't access, for example, the real graphics card or network card, it can only access a \"virtual\" or \"emulated\" one. If you try to install the real drivers for your hardware it will time-out, as it can't find them. But you should install the \"Guest additions\", this package contains all the drivers needed for the virtual hardware.\nSometimes, you can access the real hardware, it usually happens when you connect USB devices directly to the Virtual Machine, or when using some special advanced configurations. In those cases you need (and can) install the real drivers.\n", "Q: How do I install Ubuntu with some broken keys on the keyboard? I'm attempting to install Ubuntu 12.10 onto my older laptop.

Is there a way I can change the functions called on the keys for example?\n\nA: Just get an external keyboard and use that for the installation.\nAt the setup screen (boot menu) or even at the installation selection screen, no kernel is alive yet, so you have nothing to fiddle with. (read: no options, no workaround for your current hardware faults)\nAfter installation, you can get rid of that external keyboard after you've remapped keys on your laptop's keyboard.

So my question is… how can I make apt-get forget about en_CA?\n\nA: You have leftover files in /var/lib/apt/lists/ from when you had changed the locales. Apt.conf is not used anymore, but Apt is building the config database from that list of files (among other things). If you look in the dir, you will see files with \"translation\" and \"en_CA\" in the name. The Ign messages are simply Apt telling you that the files are not needed and are being ignored.

Deja Dup Backup is running but delivering error messages about not enough storage space. There are only 2.6 Gb of files in Ubuntu One and the limit is 5 Gb. Deja Dup has been an annoying software which turns itself on more often than scheduled and keeps trying unsuccessfully to create a first backup - more error messages. I don't know what is in the Ubuntu One files or how they got there. Can anyone help without using patronising Linux speak please? I understand plain English best.\n\nA: Ubuntu One no longer exists, so yes you need another backup plan.\n\nA: Just to explain, Ubuntu One is a file storage and music purchasing service. Deja Dup might put files in your Ubuntu One personal storage, or a hard drive, depending on how you set it up. Anyway, if you have more data that Deja Dup wants to back up, than you can fit based on how much room is left in Ubuntu One, it will cough out errors about space. \nIf your disk crashes, you can log in to Ubuntu One on any computer(that has internet), preferable a Ubuntu machine. You can then download your files from there, and if you have enough space to DejaDup, restores can be done semi-automatically.\nRemember that yo can always plug in a hard drive(external) and set up Deja Dup to backup to there, in DejaDup settings. So, you're not paying for storage, but you DO have a backup, just in case.\n\nA: Just using Ubuntu One for backup without Deja Dup isn't a great solution. You wont have back dated versions of your files. What happens if you screw something up, sync the changes to Ubuntu One and then realise you made a mistake? You have no previous version to restore.\nWith Deja Dup, you can have multiple (as long as you have storage space) backups, each one dated. \nI currently use Deja Dup to backup to external drive, but I'm considering also using it to backup to Ubuntu One.

See pam_pwquality.so man pages for usage details & examples.\n\nPassword complexity is enforced by the pam_cracklib module.\nIn order to modify the password policy for your local machine, you will need to modify your /etc/pam.d/common-password file.\nFrom a terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T), enter the following command:\nsudo vi /etc/pam.d/common-password\n\nAdd the following line to the file (before pam_unix.so or whichever PAM module is used primarily for authentication, as can be seen from examples in the manpage) and save the file:\npassword requisite pam_cracklib.so ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 dcredit=-1  ocredit=-1\n\nThis statement implements the following password requirements:\n\n*\n\n*dcredit == digit\n\n*ucredit == upper-case character\n\n*lcredit ==lower-case character\n\n*ocredit == other character (special characters, including ! , @ # $ %)\n\nThis should satisfy your requirements.\nYou could also use the variables minlength and retries to further restrict the password requirements.\nHere is another good example of modifying a password policy in this manner would be placing the following line in the /etc/pam.d/common-password file:\npassword requisite pam_cracklib.so retry=3 minlen=10 difok=3 ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 dcredit=-1  ocredit=-1\n\nThis entry will set a maximum of three attempts at getting an acceptable password with a 10-character minimum length.\nThis sets the requirement for users to have a minimum of three characters different from the last password.\nThis will also fulfill the requirement of having the password contain at least one each of digit, lower-case character, and upper-case characters.\nSee also this article on setting up stronger password policy rules in linux.\n\nA: There's a fork of pam_cracklib by Tomas Mraz: pam_pwquality with slightly better options.\nAdd it with apt install libpam-pwquality\nor passwd will complain:\n\nModule is unknown\n\n", "Q: is there other program to make ubuntu apps besides quickly?

I have a Dell XPS 17 (3D) laptop that comes with Nvidia GT 555M. I installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on my laptop (not side-by-side to Windows, but as an application inside Windows using Wubi).\nI installed and activated the Nvidia driver (recommended) in Additional Drivers. This went fine and the driver is activated. The problem is,  I'm unable to use 3D acceleration. 3D desktop effects don't work.\nPlease, let me know how to enable 3D desktop effects/3D acceleration.\n\nA: Based on your comments and some Google I think by the 3D acceleration you mean the fancy effects that the old Ubuntu versions used to have, e.g. windows zooming out when you minimise but also the more complicated stuff, such as wobbly windows.\nI think this is something else than the actual 3D acceleration, which you have already enabled by installing and activating the proprietary drivers.\nIn order to do these simple effects, please see the top rated answer in What happened to the Visual Effects tab, in the Appearance window? Briefly put, you can use CompizConfig Settings Manager (CCSM) to enable the \"3D\" effects. The selection in Appearance has been removed, but you can still edit these things manually.\nThe fancy animations (wobbly windows, etc) are also in CCSM. Just be careful with changing these settings and playing around, if you change the wrong settings you will break Compiz and have to reset to the defaults, as explained in How do I reset my Unity configuration?\nIf I misunderstood please post it here.\n", "Q: Can I uninstall a previous release and then reinstall a newer release using Wubi? I have Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat on my dual-boot laptop right now. However, I want to use the 12.04 LTS release instead. Since I used Wubi, is it possible to uninstall Ubuntu 10.10 from Windows and the install 12.04 from Windows again?\nThat is assuming nothing goes wrong with Windows when I uninstall 10.10!\n\nA: Yes, you can just remove Ubuntu from the Add/Remove Programs or Programs and Features control panel, and then install the newer version. \nHowever, if you want to preserve your data and settings, you will need to back up your home directory from within Ubuntu. You can do this by booting into Ubuntu and copying things over to your Windows drive or a USB storage device.\n\nA: I can't see why it wouldn't be possible, even with Wubi.  You'd simply uninstall the existing installation and install the new one as if from scratch.\n", "Q: How do I get EGL and OpenGLES libraries for Ubuntu running on VirtualBox? I have Ubuntu running on VirtualBox. Guest additions are installed and now the OS is hardware acceleration capable. I have OpenGL library in place.\nNow I want to run apps using egl + opengles1.1 & 2.0. How do i get them on Ubuntu? \nAre there any open-source libraries available? \nThe libraries should use the VirtualBox-provided hardware acceleration capabilities.\n\nA: You can search for packages and package contents with apt-cache:\n> apt-cache search opengles \nmesa-utils-extra - Miscellaneous Mesa utilies (opengles, egl)\n\nThe output says that OpenGLES probably is in the package mesa-utils-extra.  Mesa 3D has a project page for OpenGLES and writes there:\n\nMesa implements OpenGL ES 1.1 and OpenGL ES 2.0. More informations about OpenGL ES can be found at http://www.khronos.org/opengles/.\n\nEGL is also built into Mesa:\n> apt-cache search mesa | grep -i egl\nmesa-utils-extra - Miscellaneous Mesa

Wait until both Ubuntu and the printer are fully powered on and booted (post-POST), and then re-/connect the USB cable.\nThis solved the issue.  I have seen numerous references to folks stating that swapping out a new USB cable or changing USB ports \"fixes\" this issue.  It is likely that all these problems are simply due to CUPS (or some Linux printing sub-system) getting locked up on the USB device being not ready, and then never polling again.\n\nFWIW:  Her workstation is pretty old -- P4 w/2GB & usually dug ~1GB into swap (not actively swapping).  Don't know if that matters in this particular case.\nThought it would be worth reporting as it seems like such a trivial fix for something affecting so many folks. \nIs this the only fix or is there another way to fix this issue?\n\nA: The solution that it works when both are on is because the USB 1.1 you are connecting the printer to has very little power and can have problems with detecting it due to that issue, nothing to be done on Ubuntu as it never makes the USBs go to sleep by default and always gives them the same ammount of power.\nPS: If you have a USB 2.0 on the Pentium 4 you will see that you won´t have the issue again when connecting it to that port (once Ubuntu is booted)\n", "Q: Wired LAN works for 5 min and then stop working Internet (wired) works fine in windows but In Ubuntu 12.10 it stop working after 5 min of starting Ubuntu although connection does not disconnect it shows connected even if its not working. \nMy laptop model is Lenovo Ideapad Z560.\nsai@ubuntu:~$ ifconfig eth0\neth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 88:ae:1d:39:88:40  \n          inet addr:172.17.3.252  Bcast:172.17.15.255  Mask:255.255.240.0\n          inet6 addr: fe80::8aae:1dff:fe39:8840/64 Scope:Link\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:11179 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:137 errors:0 dropped:47 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 \n          RX bytes:952745 (952.7 KB)  TX bytes:21060 (21.0 KB)\n\nRelevant lscpi -nnk output:\n06:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Atheros Communications Inc.

So i'm wondering if its looking in the wrong place for the firmware?\nMy laptop is a hp pavilion and this is my result of lspci -nn:\n00:00.0 Host bridge [0600]: Intel Corporation Mobile 4 Series Chipset Memory Controller Hub [8086:2a40] (rev 07)\n00:02.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation Mobile 4 Series Chipset Integrated Graphics Controller [8086:2a42] (rev 07)\n00:02.1 Display controller [0380]: Intel Corporation Mobile 4 Series Chipset Integrated Graphics Controller [8086:2a43] (rev 07)\n00:1a.0 USB controller [0c03]: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB UHCI Controller #4 [8086:2937] (rev 03)\n00:1a.1 USB controller [0c03]: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB UHCI Controller #5 [8086:2938] (rev 03)\n00:1a.7 USB controller [0c03]: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB2 EHCI Controller #2 [8086:293c] (rev 03)\n00:1b.0 Audio device [0403]: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) HD Audio Controller [8086:293e] (rev 03)\n00:1c.0 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) PCI Express Port 1 [8086:2940] (rev 03)\n00:1c.1 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) PCI Express Port 2 [8086:2942] (rev 03)\n00:1c.2 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) PCI Express Port 3 [8086:2944] (rev 03)\n00:1c.3 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) PCI Express Port 4 [8086:2946] (rev 03)\n00:1c.4 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) PCI Express Port 5 [8086:2948] (rev 03)\n00:1c.5 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) PCI Express Port 6 [8086:294a] (rev 03)\n00:1d.0 USB controller [0c03]: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB UHCI Controller #1 [8086:2934] (rev 03)\n00:1d.1 USB controller [0c03]: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB UHCI Controller #2 [8086:2935] (rev 03)\n00:1d.2 USB controller [0c03]: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB UHCI Controller #3 [8086:2936] (rev 03)\n00:1d.3 USB controller [0c03]: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB UHCI Controller #6 [8086:2939] (rev 03)\n00:1d.7 USB controller [0c03]: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) USB2 EHCI Controller #1 [8086:293a] (rev 03)\n00:1e.0 PCI bridge [0604]: Intel Corporation 82801 Mobile PCI Bridge [8086:2448] (rev 93)\n00:1f.0 ISA bridge [0601]: Intel Corporation ICH9M LPC Interface Controller [8086:2919] (rev 03)\n00:1f.2 SATA controller [0106]: Intel Corporation 82801IBM/IEM (ICH9M/ICH9M-E) 4 port SATA Controller [AHCI mode] [8086:2929] (rev 03)\n00:1f.3 SMBus [0c05]: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) SMBus Controller [8086:2930] (rev 03)\n00:1f.6 Signal processing controller [1180]: Intel Corporation 82801I (ICH9 Family) Thermal Subsystem [8086:2932] (rev 03)\n02:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Corporation BCM4312 802.11b/g LP-PHY [14e4:4315] (rev 01)\n03:00.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.

I´am playing with Software Center's API, after seeing this post on askubuntu.\nMy question is: how can I get a list of all Ubuntu Software Center's apps?\nFrom the other question I get this endpoint for retrieving all apps: http://software-center.ubuntu.com/api/2.0/applications/any/ubuntu/any/any/\nBut the problem is it looks like it only returns 580 apps.\nBut on appnr.com it seems their  a lot more apps in the Ubuntu Software Center? \nlike 30204 packages?\nSo then how can I get all Ubuntu Software Center's apps? \n\nA: On local system\nUsing your local package management caches a simple use of some shell scripting:\napt-cache dumpavail | grep ^Package | cut -d \" \" -f 2 | sort | uniq\n\nThis just lists package names, so it's not the same as using the Software Centre API, but it will list all package names you can use later to query the API with, I guess. This lists 38820 packages on my system. Be aware that it may contain non-Ubuntu repository backed packages, so not all of them might be available in the SC.\nNote: on amd64 systems with Multiarch enabled apt-cache will list many double ones, so that's why the uniq tool is used.\n\nOnline\nGo to packages.ubuntu.com, see the section Browse through the lists of packages:, follow the link of the distribution (version), then click the link at the bottom of the page (All packages), e.g. packages.ubuntu.com/quantal/allpackages.\n", "Q: Xen - install fully paravirtualized Ubuntu - no virtual kernel in bootloader I followed this guide:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Xen\nI managed to get 99% the way through it, but it appears the xen-netboot image doesnt install a virtual kernel (it says 'generic' at the end instead of virtual in grub menu) as shown here:\n\nHere is my config:\nname = 'client1-ubuntu-32'\nmemory = 512\ndisk = ['phy:/dev/ubu-32/xen-lvm,xvda,w']\nvif = [' ']\n\n# Comment this out if uncommenting the next section (installing)\n#bootloader=\"/usr/bin/pygrub\"\n\n# This section is for installing ubuntu\nkernel = \"/var/lib/xen/images/ubuntu-netboot/vmlinuz\"\nramdisk = \"/var/lib/xen/images/ubuntu-netboot/initrd.gz\"\nextra = \"debian-installer/exit/always_halt=true -- console=hvc0\"\n\nI used the initrd and vmlinuz from the answer on this serverfault post: http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/precise/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/xen/\nTo run the paravirtualized guest I need to run the 'virtual' kernel I believe.

It appears when more than one version of a program is installed. In this case you can select which Java version is used to execute Java programs.\nThe top one is the presently selected. Below that all the options are listed. In this case you can choose between the JRE and the JDK. JRE is the Java Runtime Environment and is usually fine for running all Java programs. JDK is the Java Development Kit. It is mainly needed to compile Java programs. Some programming tools require to be run with the JDK instead of JRE. If you are not developing programs in Java, selecting the JRE is fine.\nIf you had Java 6 (or 5) installed alongside with Java 7, it would also appear in this list.\nYou can check the version using java --version. The selection can be changed later on with sudo update-java-alternatives. Try forcing this.\nIf it doesn't work reinstall the java packages. If you are not developing Java you could also remove the JDK entirely, making the selection obsolete.\n\nA: In my system I have installed OpenJDK in offline mode and it went successful. I am sharing you the same. Before you start, remove all old files so that you don't get in to any confusion and start with any one i.e., either JDK or JRE.\nInstallation of OpenJDK on Ubuntu :\n1)  Download OpenJDK\n2)  Extract the tar file.(using any of the two steps)\n      Right click on the .tar file and select Extract Here.\n\n      or open Terminal and give the command tar –xzf <filename>\n\nexample:\n           $ tar xzf jdk-7u7-linux-i586.tar.gz\n\n3) Move the extracted file to the “/usr/lib/jvm/” folder: [Note: If you don’t find a jvm folder in /usr/lib/ path , create a jvm folder there: $ sudo mkdir –p /usr/lib/jvm/]\n           $ sudo mv jdk1.7.0_07 /usr/lib/jvm/\n\n4) Install in your system :\n           $ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_07/bin/javac 1\n\n5) That’s it. Test your Java :\n           $ java -version \n\nRemember to replace the file name with the one you have downloaded.\n", "Q: How to install rar (no installation candidate)? I need the package rar. But I get this error whenever I try to install it:\nReading package Lists... Done\nBuilding dependency tree\nReading state information... Done\nPackage rar ist not available, but is referred to by another package.\nThis may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only available form another source\nE: package 'rar' has no installation candidate.\n\nWhat must I do to get rar?\n\nA: Package rar exists in multiverse: http://packages.ubuntu.com/quantal/rar\nMultiverse is a non-free repositorie so... make sure you enable it/have it enabled. \napt-cache policy rar tells you where to find it:\n\n$ apt-cache policy rar\nrar:\n  Installed: (none)\n  Candidate: 1:3.7.1-1\n  Version table:\n     1:3.7.1-1 0\n        500 http://nl.archive.ubuntu.com hardy/multiverse Packages\n\n\nA: Install with the following commands,\nsudo apt-get install unrar-free\n\nA: rar is provided in the multiverse component, so you must enable that repository. To do this, open up the Software Sources window in any of three ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Alt+F2 and run software-properties-gtk. (Use software-properties-kde instead if this is a Kubuntu system.)\n\n*Open the Software Updater (or Update Manager, in older releases) and click Settings... at the lower-left corner of the window.\n\n*Open the Software Center and go to Edit > Software Sources....\n\n\n\nIn the Ubuntu Software tab of the Software Sources window, under **Downloadable from the Internet*, one of the checkboxes is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Software restricted by copyright or legal issues (multiverse)\n\n\nCheck that box. You may be prompted for your password, to make the change. After you've done so and the box has a check in it, click Close to close the Software Sources window. Now try installing again.\n(If it still doesn't work and you're installing from the Terminal with apt-get, try running apt-get update then attempting the installation again.)\nHow to find software with \"no installation candidate\"?\nTo find out why you might not have been able to install rar, the first thing I did was to go to packages.ubuntu.com and search for it.\n\nSearching for rar in all supported releases (can also search one specific release).\nThe results revealed it to be in the multiverse component.\n\n\nA: Try this, it worked for me:\nwget http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/pool/non-free/r/rar/rar_5.5.0-1_amd64.deb\n\ndpkg -i rar_5.5.0-1_amd64.deb\n\napt-get install -f\n\n", "Q: Upgrade Ubuntu server 11.04 to 11.10 fails I'm trying to upgrade our ubuntu server 11.04 to 11.10.

Specifically I want to add  it 15 GB.\nWhat is the best sequence of steps to do?\nThe output from sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda and sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb\n\n\nA: Make sure your backups of documents and other important files are current. You might make a mistake, or data loss could occur during dynamic partition resizing. Once that's done,  boot from an Ubuntu live CD/DVD/USB, select Try Ubuntu, and run the GParted Partition Editor.\nTaking space from /dev/sda7 is the easiest, as it requires a lower number of resize/move operations than taking it from /dev/sda5. This, in turn, is because your /dev/sda7 partition is closer to the beginning (left) boundary of /dev/sda2 (the extended partition container), and that boundary has to be moved.\n\n*\n\n*Right-click on /dev/sda7 (your Ubuntu partition, /) and click Resize/Move. Shrink it from the left--that is, increase the Free space preceding.\nDecrease it by however much you want your Windows partition to increase. Please note that you won't necessarily be able to increase your Windows partition by exactly that amount (depending on alignment issues), but it will be pretty close.\nNow there is space between /dev/sda6 and /dev/sda7.\n\n\n*Right-click on /dev/sda6 (your linux-swap partition) and click Resize/Move. Slide it as far to the right as possible, so it is once again flush against /dev/sda7 (or as close as it can be).\nNow there is unallocated space at the very beginning of the extended partition.\n\n\n*Right-click on /dev/sda2 (the extended partition). It's much easier to select this form the list than from the horizontal bar representing your disk. Click Resize/Move. Shrink it from the left--that is, increase the Free space preceding.\nNow there is unallocated space outside the extended partition, immediately to the right of the Windows partition.\n\n\n*This is the moment you've been waiting for. Expand the Windows partition (/dev/sda1) to fill that space: Right-click on it, click Reize/Move, and expand it on the right--that is, decrease the Free space following.\n\n\n*Click the check mark to apply your changes, and hope everything works out OK. When that's done, quit GParted.\nYou won't necessarily have to reinstall Ubuntu's GRUB2 boot loader to the Master Boot Record, but you might as well, as long as you're already booted into the live environment. (Otherwise, you might have to boot back to the live CD/DVD/USB to do it, after discovering that GRUB is not working well enough to boot Ubuntu...or to boot anything.)\nOpen a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run these commands to reinstall GRUB2 to the MBR (it's this technique, but with the correct values for your system filled in):\nsudo mount /dev/sda7 /mnt    # For other folks: Replace sda7 with your / device.\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda\nsudo umount /mnt\n\nIt's theoretically possible that your Windows system will also need to be repaired, but very unlikely, because:\n\n*\n\n*GRUB2 takes care of bootstrapping to the Windows boot loader (which is in the boot sector of its partition, not in the MBR). That's still present and fully intact.\nThat's the real reason the Windows system will almost certainly be fine. Read on, if secondary factors interest you...\n\n\n*The Windows partition still begins in the same place on the disk.\n\n\n*The Windows partition was just expanded to the right, so all its files are in the same place on the disk.\n\n\n*Some Windows 7 systems have separate partitions for the boot loader (similar to, but not quite the same as, a /boot partition on some Ubuntu and other Unix-like systems). Yours does not. So there's nothing external to sda1 that matters, when it comes to whether or not the Windows system works. GRUB2 passes control to the boot loader in sda1, and from there on everything is in the same place it was before.\nIn the event that your Windows system did stop booting and you had to repair it, you could do it from the recovery console on a Windows install DVD/USB, including a trial DVD/USB.\nBut you probably don't need to resize your partitions at all.\nNow that I've presented detailed instructions for resizing your partitions, I'd like to suggest an alternative.\nI'm guessing you want to expand your Windows primary partition because you need to fit more into folders that are supposed to be located on that partition and not some other partition.\nHowever, you have another NTFS partition (a logical partition, in the extended partition, to the right of Ubuntu's partitions) with plenty of free space.\nSo you can make NTFS junctions in your small-ish Windows partition, with their target folders in the big-ish logical NTFS partiton.\nFor example, a folder from inside Program Files (or even Program Files itself!) could be moved off to the bigger NTFS partition, and a junction created in its place, pointing to it on the big partition.\nOr take a look at \"How to create and manipulate NTFS junction points,\" which explains how to use the linkd and delrp commands to create and destroy junctions. Or you may prefer the junction command, which you can get here. (Windows 7 also supports another kind of symbolic link, see this article and mklink.)\nNTFS directory junctions are a lot like symbolic links in ext4 and other Unix-style filesystems. But be careful! Directory junctions are parsed like directories, even in situations where *nix symlinks would be parsed like files. For example:\n\n*\n\n*Deleting a junction, the way you'd delete a file or folder, deletes what it points to. (Or at least deletes the contents of what it points to.)\n\n*If a directory C:\\foo contains a directory qux, which contains a junction bar pointing to D:\\baz, and you recursively delete foo or qux (for example, by Shift+Deleteing the folder in Windows Explorer), D:\\baz and everything contained within it gets deleted.\n\n*Moving C:\\foo\\qux to C:\\ (so it will be C:\\qux) moves D:\\baz and everything in it from D: to C:!\nNTFS junctions don't cause problems in Ubuntu. NTFS-3G, Ubuntu's NTFS filesystem driver, is compatible with them (though they're treated like Unix-style symbolic links, which means they behave a bit differently than on Windows).\nFor details or advice on creating and managing junctions (or other forms of symbolic links, as were added in Windows 7) within Windows, you should ask somewhere Windows is supported, such as Super User. (And, at least in my opinion, you should use Windows to make them if you decide to use them, even if it's theoretically possible to do so in Ubuntu.) But I wanted to present what may be a good alternative to resizing your partitions.\n\nA: DISCLAIMER\nbefore proceeding, be prepared to have an unbootable system. Get a Knoppix, a Win7 recovery disk and someone that knows how to recover from a broken Grub2/Win7 bootloader.\nOk, here is what should be the simplest solution. Resize /dev/sda5 to be close to 165Gb. You'll end up with a free 30Gb partition at the end of the disk. There you can copy your primary NTFS partition (/dev/sda1) and resize it to fill the empty space.\nWhen gparted has finished, hide the first partition (/dev/sda1) and update the grub2 configuration immediately (sudo update-grub).\nWin7 shouldn't have problems in booting from a logical partition at the end of the disk if grub2 does it work properly. However Win7 is unpredictable by definition, so be prepared.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: Official Daily PPA for Unity?

In general this should make it work in newer releases (If not it is a regression and should be considered a bug ;) )\nFrom the link:\n\nFirst, plug it into a USB port!\nEdit|Preferences...|Devices|Recording|Device: Blue Snowball :...|Channels: 1(Mono)|OK\nEdit|Preferences...|Recording|Sound Activated Recording|(check the box and set the level to -33db.|OK\nEdit|Preferences...|Quality|Default Sample Format: (select 16-bit)|OK\n  (actually, you can do all of these and then press OK)\nNext, you have to raise the audio input level: Click the speaker icon at the upper right of the desktop screen and select Sound Preferences...|Input|(set the button for Blue Snowball). Then move the Input volume: slider to the far right (full volume).\nNow you should be able to record. But before you start, use the Zoom Out to increase the display timescale to beyond the time that you expect to record (so that Audacity does not have to redraw the display and possibly drop some audio samples). Press the red button on Audacity and then play some music (or make some noise!). You should see a plot of your audio. Press the yellow square to stop recording. Then press the green triangle to play it back. This all worked for me. Hope it does for you. It took me awhile to figure out how to set the input volume. That was the only problem I had...\n\n\nAlso install pavucontrol (as said in comments). It has alot more options than the basic sound settings. It saved me some trouble with my HDMI audio on a dual display and I have seen others getting solutions from it after suggesting it. \n", "Q: An offline-maps application I'd like to have a software that allows me to download and view (OpenStreetMap-) maps of the whole world or a certain area I chose to download. Ideally, it should behave just like the map-website but be usable even without internet connection. Do you know such an app?\n\nA: Try GMapCatcher https://code.google.com/p/gmapcatcher/. It has support for downloading maps from various providers, including OpenStreetMaps. I found it to be quite fast even when browsing online, as compared to the web version of google maps.\n\nIt has lots of options (https://code.google.com/p/gmapcatcher/wiki/User_Guide). I have not tested all of them, but it seems to be promising. \n\nA: Try Marble: it allows to download a certain quantity of maps (a certain number of zoom levels from a starting level located anywhere) for offline use.\n\nA: You can use Microsoft solutions (Streets & Tips/Autoroute) with Wine.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 will not shutdown My ubuntu(12.04) never shutdown.\nDid not help this:\n1) sudo halt\n2) sudo shutdown -h now\n3) update grub(acpi-force)\nI think it's after installaton AMD Catalyst. My friend has similar problem and he thiks it's after Gnome-shell installation.\nWho have similar problem, help please! \nUPDATE\nThis is my syslog\nhttp://pastebin.com/x4VD2gH1\n$ sudo /sbin/acpi_available && echo $?\n0\n\n\nA: Have you Tried Using ' sudo shutdown -P now ', which halts the system then requests a power off or perhaps switching to a tty console and seeing what happens from there ? If your really in a jam you could also try ctrl+alt+del at a tty console not gnome or gnome-terminal emulator and the system should reboot. If you continue to have issues, I'd try reinstalling before making a bug-report as it could just be a goof in your installation. \n", "Q: Is my battery going bad? I am wondering if my battery is bad, or if I could improve on it. Basically, I am wondering why this image shows Energy when full: 11.9 and Energy (design): 48.9 Why doesn't my battery get around 48.9? Is there any way I can get more information? Can I improve this without getting a new battery?\n\n\nA: If correct, that is the sign of a bad battery.  You can try to fully charge the battery, then discharge ( computer should shut down at around 3% left ), then recharge it to recalibrate the measurement.  The time it takes to do so will also confirm how accurate the reading is.\n\nA: Yes, it seems your battery has reached the end of its life. If it's in warranty, return it.\n\nIs there any way I can get more information?\n\nTry upower -d in a terminal. It's just a little bit more verbose.\n\nCan I improve this without getting a new battery?\n\nNot really. These numbers are reported by the embedded controller of your PC. It's not something you can do about in software.\nRecalibration\nYou can try recalibration by completely depleting it first. Ignore warnings about shutdown in a safe environment such as a Live CD and make sure the laptop turns off by itself. Then recharge it fully again.\nSome laptop manufacturers have a calibration tool for this. Not really of any help in most cases, I can tell you from past experience.\n", "Q: How do I deploy units that use the -proposed repository? I'd like to deploy some units with proposed fixes in Ubuntu, how can I have my units deploy with these bugfixes to I can test to see if my bug is fixed?\n\nA: You can tell Juju to used the proposed repository by changing juju-origin to proposed.\nWhat I'm doing is just setting up two local environments, so I have a dedicated proposed one for testing. \n  local-proposed:\n    type: local\n    control-bucket: juju-a14dfae383222222220142d9ac23c499395c2785999\n    admin-secret: 6608267bbd6b447b8c90934162227b2a294999\n    default-series: precise\n    juju-origin: proposed\n    data-dir: /home/jorge/juju-data\n\n", "Q: How to sync files on 2 computers using an ethernet cable (offline)? I have a laptop running Ubuntu 12.04 and a netbook running Ubuntu 12.10.\nI want to sync some folders from my laptop on my netbook, connecting them with an ethernet cable.\nBoth computers are offline, and I don't want to (eventually) share files through my office LAN.\nWhat options do I have? Can I use Unison? What do I have to do in order to \"connect\" the two computers? (i.e. I have to manually set IPs on them, IPv4 settings, and so on).\n\nA: You do need to set IP addresses manually, both on netbook and notebook.  The addresses must be on the same subnet.\nAs for the sync, you may use RSYNC over SSH to achieve this.  The command is as follow:\n$ rsync -avzgroupP -e ssh origin_folder login@dst_machine:destination_folder\n\nPay attention to the folder notation.  If you add the / to the end of the directory, RSYNC will start to copy/put files from this point on but if you omit the /, then RSYNC will copy the folder itself and onward.\n\nA: Using Timo Kluck's instruction (-> see below!) I was quickly able to set up a connection between my two laptops.\nHowever rsync proved not to work for me like this. But I found another solution on the internet, using a adhoc http server:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the computer where the file you want to transfer is located: cd into the directory where the file is located\n\n*then execute the command \npython -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000\n\nin the same terminal window. This starts up a simple HTTP Server reachable on port 8000 which makes accessible the files in the current folder you cd'ed to, and also the subfolders.\n\n*To transfer the file, on the other computer, in terminal execute the command \nwget -r [ip of server computer]:[port number chosen above]/[file name]\n\nwhere you could replace [file name] also with [subfolder1]/[subfolder2]/[file name 2] if you want to download a file out of a subfolder.\nWith this method I was able to get 60 - 100 MB/s. \n\nA: Here's how to set up the network connection.\n\n\n*\n\n*connect both computers using any ethernet cable.\n\n*on each computer do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*select your network icon and choose the 'Edit...' option\n\n*choose 'Add...' in the 'Cable' tab\n\n*in the IPv4 tab, select 'Manual' for the method, and add the data\nip-address: 192.168.1.1    (and 192.168.1.2 for the other computer)\nnetmask: 255.255.255.0\n\nleave the rest empty\n\n*uncheck the box 'automatically connect'\n\n*call your new connection something like \"point-to-point connection (ip-address 192.168.1.1) and choose 'Save'\n\n\n*select this connection on both computers\n\n*Use rsync as in fboaventura's answer\n\n\nIt may seem easier to just assign the ip-address and netmask using ifconfig. However, I found out that my network dropped all the time, and I think that was because of NetworkManager interfering. The method above lets NetworkManager be aware of the way you want it to be set up.\n", "Q: Libreoffice closes multiple windows I am working with multiple documents in LibreOffice, all are open in separate windows.\nwhen I click the exit button, or go to the file menu clicking on \"quit\", ALL windows close, not just the one I wanted to close.\nHow do I avoid closing ALL windows, and how can I just close one of the windows?\n\nA: LibreOffice is an MDI (multiple document interface) program. There is always only a single parent container for all open documents. This is true no matter what kind of document is open: Writer, Calc, and so on. \nWhen you have multiple documents open and each is in its own non-maximized window, it may appear that each window is a separate instance of LibreOffice; but it is not. All windows still belong to a single parent container. \nWhen you choose File > Exit, you are closing the parent container and all open documents will close.\nHow to close the active document and leave the others open\nYou have several options.\n\n\n*\n\n*Use File > Close. The Close command is above Save in the standard menu.\n\n*Use Alt+F4\n\n*Click the Close (X) button on the title bar of the document window. If the document is maximized, the Close (X) button on the global menubar will belong to the active document.\n\n*Use Ctrl+w\n", "Q: What does 'Magic number does not match' mean when installing software?

I recently installed Windows 7 on a computer. Left a partition to install linux. Today when I tried to install linux, the installer (of two distros that I tried) failed to recognise the already present partitions. It just shows it as one big unallocated space. However fdisk recognised them just fine.\nTurns out I have a GUID partition table. So the installers don't recognise it.\nI can boot both into UEFI mode and legacy BIOS mode. If I boot into UEFI mode, I can't boot into any OS, whether it is the installed Windows 7 or Ubuntu or any other linux DVD. It just shows a Operating System not found error. It only boots into the Windows 8 that came preinstalled in the laptop in the UEFI mode. I also have Secure boot disabled.\nWhile installing Windows 7 I booted into legacy BIOS mode.\nCan anybody please tell me how I can install Linux on a computer with GPT? I don't want to reformat the whole drive and start fresh with new partition table.\n\nA: I suspect that you don't have GPT; you have leftover GPT data. Here's what I think happened:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your computer came with Windows 8 booting in EFI mode and using a GPT disk.\n\n*You booted the Windows 7 installer in BIOS mode and forced it to delete the GPT data and install in BIOS mode on an MBR disk. Unfortunately, this only deleted the GPT protective MBR, leaving the bulk of the GPT data intact. (This is known to happen with older partitioning tools and with the Windows partitioning tools.) Technically, the disk is now a legal MBR disk.\n\n*When you booted a Linux installer, its libparted-based partitioning tools became confused by the leftover GPT data and reported the disk as being empty. This is a long-standing bug in libparted.\n\n\nIf I'm right, the problem is easily corrected with by my FixParts program (versions are available for both Windows and Linux). Just run it, tell it to delete the stray GPT data when prompted, and exit. Thereafter, the libparted-based partitioner in Ubuntu's installer should be able to handle the disk. If I'm wrong and the disk really is a valid GPT disk, FixParts will refuse to modify it. In that case, you should post back with the output of sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda and sudo parted /dev/sda print.\n", "Q: `Compiz` profile settings export and import using command line How can i export and import Compiz current profile settings using Command line.\nI'm using ubuntu 12.10. Or can i get a script for doing export and import.\n\nA: I'm not sure of a command line utility, but you can easily do this with a script in Python and python-compizconfig package. Here you go:\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport sys, os\nimport compizconfig\n\n#The last input on the command line will be the path to save the file to.\nsavefile=sys.argv[-1]\n\ncontext=compizconfig.Context()\n#Change keyword if you want to skip saving entries that are default\ncontext.Export(os.path.abspath(savefile),skipDefaults=False)\n\nTo import settings, you could just change the last line to context.Import(os.path.abspath(savefile))\nNow to run, just save and chmod +x scriptname.py and run ./scriptname.py FILE or run with python scriptname.py FILE if you don't chmod.\nWARNING- I have only tested a bit and basic functionality works, but I guarantee nothing. The script can be made much more robust and functional.  \n\nA: Small update I wanted to add to importing that I found.\n#!/usr/bin/python\n#http://askubuntu.com/questions/244333/compiz-profile-settings-export-and-import-using-command-line\nimport sys\nimport compizconfig\n\n#The last input on the command line will be the path to save the file to.\nsavefile=sys.argv[-1]\n\ncontext=compizconfig.Context()\n\n#saveFile is the name of the file. True specifies whether or not to overwrite current settings.\ncontext.Import(savefile, True)\n\nI was having an issue on import where it didn't seem to be overwriting the default values.  Appending True to the end of the Import statement seems to have fixed that.\n", "Q: Receiving error while trying to debug in QtProject I installed the latest version of the QtProject so now I can debug C++ code.  \nWhile trying to debug for the first time I got this error:\nptrace: Operation not permitted.\n\nCould not attach to the process.

You can use w3m for that:\nw3m -o cgi_bin=/path/to/cgi-bin file:/cgi-bin/script.cgi\n\nDetails about that syntax are here.\nOne option with Apache is to use the ScriptAlias directive.\nHowever, first you may wish to publish a \"basic \"test.html\" file in the web server root directory, and make sure you access that. Then move on to trying a CGI script. \nOf course, check the web server logs if something goes wrong.

That being said I am familiar with bash, wget, and awk being called but how do I call python files to run in the terminal?  I would like to learn this but I am unsure on where to research it.  I have a .pyw file that references several .py files in a folder.  \n\nA: It's also worth mentioning that by adding a -i flag after python, you can keep your session running for further coding. Like this:\npython -i <file_name.py>\n\n\nA: python <filename.py>\n\npyw should run in the same manner, I think. You can also start an interactive console with just\npython\n\nAlso, you can avoid having to invoke python explicitly by adding a shebang at the top of the script:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\n... or any number of variations thereof\n\nA: First run following command\nchmod +x <filename>.py\n\nThen at the top of the script, add #! and the path of the Python interpreter:\n#!/usr/bin/python\n\nIf you would like the script to be independent of where the Python interpreter lives, you can use the env program. Almost all Unix variants support the following, assuming the Python interpreter is in a directory in the user's $PATH:\n#! /usr/bin/env python\n\n\nA: Option 1: Call the interpreter\n\n*\n\n*For Python 2: python <filename>.py\n\n*For Python 3: python3 <filename>.py\nOption 2: Let the script call the interpreter\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the first line of your file has #!/usr/bin/env python.\n\n*Make it executable - chmod +x <filename>.py.\n\n*And run it as ./<filename>.py\n\nA: Just prefix the script's filename with python. E.g.:\npython filename.py\n\n\nA: Change directories using cd to the directory containing the .py and run one of the following two commands:\npython <filename>.py  # for Python 2.x  \npython3 <filename>.py # for Python 3.x \n\nAlternatively run one of the following two commands:   \npython /path/to/<filename>.py  # for Python 2.x  \npython3 /path/to/<filename>.py # for Python 3.x \n\n\nA: Try using the command python3 instead of python. If the script was written in Python3, and you try to run it with Python2, you could have problems. Ubuntu has both; changing the program name to python3 (instead of replacing python) made this possible. Ubuntu needs v2.7 (as of  2/16/2017) so DON'T delete or remove Python2, but keep them both.

This question is about diagnosis, not a temporary recovery. The answers on that question only tell me how to kill the X Server, use the Magic Combo to reset the kernel, etc.... which doesn't help me figure out the cause.\nSome information:\n\n*\n\n*Ubuntu 11.04: 2.6.38-15-generic #66-Ubuntu SMP x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n\n*The mouse sometimes moves around, but the UI never responds.\n\n\n*Pressing Ctrl+Alt+F1 to get into a terminal doesn't work.\n\n\n*The Alt+SysRq combos do work... and seem to be the only things that work, aside from the mouse (which sometimes also can move around).\n\n\n*I'm not running out of any resources (many gigabytes of RAM and file system space are free)\n\n\n*Possibly relevant hardware (from the Hardware Lister application):\n\n*\n\n*AR9285 Wireless Network Adapter (PCI-Express)\n\n\n*GT216 [GeForce GT 330M] (I'm using the Nouveau driver, which seems to work well)\n\nA: The logs should always be your first port of call. Check syslog for anything untoward:\nless /var/log/syslog\n\nAlso check the Xserver logs in case there's any indication of a graphics driver problem (although that sounds less likely given your description):\nless /var/log/Xorg.0.log\n\nIn your particular case, these steps might not throw up anything interesting. In which case, I'd be interested to see what's going on on your system at the time of the problem developing. To that end, personally, I'd set up a temporary log of top output at short intervals - say every 5 or 10 seconds. This should hopefully reveal if a process is running wild with resources at the time of the issue. \nNote that alternatives exist, such as switching to another tty with Ctrl+Alt+F1..F6 (to get back to the GUI, it's Ctrl+Alt+F7) and running commands interactively, or configuring a SSH server and logging in remotely. Both of these might be awkward if your machine is moreorless nonresponsive, hence my more awkward suggestion to write a logfile (which could also encounter the same problem, but is more likely to succeed). \nIt would involve something like this:\nwhile [ 1 -eq 1 ] ; do top -b >> ~/top.log; sleep 10; done\n\nThis would write top output to a logfile at ~/top.log every 10 seconds or so. Note that this log would grow quite large if this command is left running for a prolonged period, so keep an eye on it if your machine suddenly starts behaving itself!

Is anyone aware of any good \"PC on a stick\" or \"System on a stick\" devices that are good to run Ubuntu 12.10 - or even better, have Ubuntu preinstalled? ARM or x86.\nI'm looking for something like Raspberry Pi, except that Ubuntu is not supported on it since its ARM processor is too old for Ubuntu 12.10.\nOn a related note, how is software/application support for Ubuntu on ARM? Is it up to par with the x86 packages?\n\nA: The MK802 III (Wikipeda) (Amazon) is one such device. It has a newer processor and the manufacturer is the Chinese-based Rikomagic. The processor is based off the AllWinner-A8, and it supports the newest version of Ubuntu (12.10). The MK802 III is the newest version of the MK802, and goes for about $80 USD + S&H. You can find older versions for less money. It has built-in wifi and HDMI support.\nThe Cotton Candy is another such device that also has built-in wifi and HDMI. It, however, was originally meant as a device for developers, and can go for around $200 USD. Its processor is based off the ARM Cortex-A9 Exynos processor created by Samsung.\n\nA: Snappy Ubuntu-Core is now in alpha on Raspberry Pi 2 model B.\nhttp://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/\n", "Q: How do I remove files as a result of the find command?

I searched for this in google and ran accross this on stackoverflow.  However when i run that in the terminal I get \nE: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (13: Permission denied_\nE: Unable to lock administration directory, are you root?  I am root.\n\nWhere do I go from here?\n\nA: You have to run this command as super user. Try the following:\nsudo apt-get install python-tk\n\nThis should fix your problem. The magic extra thing to type is the sudo command. This will trigger a password prompt and after you've correctly entered your password the command following sudo (in this case apt-get install python-tk) will be run under administrative privileges.\n", "Q: How do I give www-data user to a folder in my home folder? I have a folder: /home/myuser/folderA\nI want to give the www-data user write access to the above, while 'myuser' continues to have normal access (as it is myuser's home folder anyway).\nWhich commands do I need to use?\nNote: I don't want www-data to have access to any other folders in /home/myuser/.\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Another way is to change the username directly in apache config, this is if it's your local machine and you save images from somewhere else that would crush any permissions made on the folder. Also to do if you have only 1 user and don't care about www-data!\n$ sudo vi /etc/apache2/apache2.conf\n\nFind User and Group and put yours\nUser <Your User>\nGroup <Your Group>\n$ sudo service apache2 restart\n\n\nA: First, add yourself into the group www-data\nusermod -a -G www-data (your username)\n\nThen:\nchgrp www-data /home/myuser/folderA\nchmod g+rwxs /home/myuser/folderA\n\nShould do the trick unless the permissions on your /home/myuser do not permit other users access.\nThe first command changes the group ownership of the folder to that of the webserver. The second command gives members of the www-data group read, write, enter-directory rights, and the group s flag will ensure that any files that get created inside that directory take www-data as the group - so if you create a file as myuser the www-data user will have access.\nNb. this also depends on the umask settings of both your user account and the webserver: you need to make sure that files created in folderA have group rw access (and directories created within need group rwx)\nIf your webserver does not have enter rights into your /home/myuser dir (quite sensible) then it's not going to get in there unless you do something else. Two solns:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo mount --bind /home/myuser/folderA /var/www/mysite/folderA  (this is an ugly hack and would have to be repeated after reboot. But a powerful trick, also can be used to make folders accessible inside SSH jails.)\n\n*Simply move the shared folder somewhere else, e.g. /home/shared-stuff/folderA.\nThe 2nd option is nicest. Let's say the stuff in folderA is really public and you don't care who sees it, you can set it up like\nsudo mkdir -m777 /home/shared-stuff\n\nThen you can put inside that, say, folderA with permissions as above, and folderB that www-data should not have access to with different permissions, e.g. \n$ cd /home/shared-stuff ; ls -l\ndrwxrwsr-x 2 myuser www-data   4096 Jan 17 21:46 folderA\ndrwxrwx--- 2 myuser myuser     4096 Jan 17 21:46 folderB\n\n", "Q: USB create for windows laptop on mac Can I create a bootable USB on a MAC which I can use on a toshiba laptop which is basically stuffed ?\n\nA: You want to create an Ubuntu live USB that boots on a non-working PC. The good news is, PC's and Macs are equally capable of this. There's no impediment to creating the flash drive for the PC just because you're doing it on a Mac.\nAssuming this Mac is of relatively recent vintage, and thus has an Intel processor, the ISO images you'd write to USB for use on a Mac would be the same or similar. But even if they weren't, the architecture of an ISO image being written to a USB flash drive would not have to be the same as the architecture of the machine writing it.\nWriting an Ubuntu Live USB on a Mac, to Use on a PC\nAssuming your Mac is running OS X, you can write the ISO image to the USB flash drive using this method or one of the methods presented here. It's advisable first to check the ISO's MD5SUM (see below for why this may be a particularly good idea in your situation).\nSo here's a summary of one pretty easy way, from beginning to end:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download a desktop ISO image. Make sure it's suitable for the computer on which you want to use it. So long as you get it from there and it's a .iso file, it will be suitable, unless your laptop has a 32-bit processor and you use the 64-bit ISO image. (The other way around is fine, though if you plan to install Ubuntu on the laptop and the laptop is 64-bit, you should strongly consider the 64-bit version.)\n\n*Open Terminal.app (shown as Terminal in Applications / Utilities). Type openssl md5 followed by a space. Drag the ISO image you downloaded from the Finder to the Terminal (this pastes its full path). Press Enter. Make sure the MD5 checksum you're shown is correct for whichever ISO file you have.\n\n*There's an easy graphical way to write the ISO to a USB flash drive. Ironically, the resultant flash drive will work on a PC but not a Mac. You only want to use it on a PC, though.\nSo it makes sense for you to use UNetbootin for Mac OS X. Get it from there, then run it, open up the ISO image you downloaded (select Diskimage instead of Distribution in UNetbootin), and write it to the USB flash drive.\n\nUNetbootin on Mac OS X, about to write an Ubuntu ISO to a USB drive (image contributed by Elisabeth Terrio)\nBe careful not to write it to the wrong drive, as if you do that, it will overwrite that drive's contents with an Ubuntu live system!\nCan it be used on the non-working / stuffed / borked laptop?\nThe bad news is that your laptop could be broken in ways that keep it from booting at all, even from a USB flash drive.\n\n\n*\n\n*This is why it's a good idea to MD5 test the ISO as described above. If it doesn't work, you don't know if it's a bad download ...or just trouble getting the Toshiba laptop to boot it.\n\n\nBut if the OS is installed on your laptop (here, Windows) is what's broken, that's fine. You can boot from an Ubuntu live USB. With the live system, you can use the computer (but you cannot save any files permanently to the live system, you must use a separate volume for that). You can also access files in the Windows system (which is handy, as it lets you recover documents and other important files).\nYou can also install Ubuntu. If you don't plan to attempt repairing your Windows system, the best way is usually to offload all the important files from it, then install Ubuntu to use the entire disk (which will overwrite it, so you must have your documents elsewhere, preferably in two places so they're backed up).\n\nA: Well I finally found an answer that allows me to create a bootable USB of Ubuntu.....\nhttp://renevanbelzen.wordpress.com/2009/10/14/creating-a-bootable-usb-stick-with-mac-os-x-in-10-easy-steps/\nIn effect this allows you to mount an image on the USB and off you go.\nIt uses Terminal in OS X to unmount the USB, copy the .ISO file renamed to .DMG using the dd (convert and copy) and unmount it again.\nAmazing it worked.\nMy UNIX is very old so that might not have worked. The throwback of dd to JCL was amazing....\nNo reason it should not work for a Windows.ISO!If you really wanted that!!!!\nUbuntu is now installed on my PC at last and death to windows8 which someone calls an operating system!\nHurray.\n\nA: I had success using Etcher : https://github.com/balena-io/etcher\nThe download size for etcher is about ~70mb (being a Electron App) which was the only con, considering the alternatives.

Unfortunately, in Ubuntu 12.10, 2D-only support for Unity has been dropped and performs very slow on non-3D capable hardware. In a virtual machine this is even less useful, as you're not after the nice eye candy, I suppose.\nI would recommend either:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stay with 12.04.

If you reboot again after that it should improve the boot speed since it now knows the location of the data and it does not have to re-instrument the files.\n\nA: Do a clean install of Ubuntu 13.10, it is the latest updated Ubuntu version.

For sake of example, my registered domain is example.com I want root cronjobs' error output to be mailed to my real david@example.com inbox. I have this relay working correctly.\nBut these root cronjobs are set by default to email to root@example.com which isn't a real email address. I have in my /etc/aliases:\nroot: david@example.com\n\nexample.com isn't listed in postfix's main.cf's mydestination so postfix doesn't think this mail is local. It bypasses processing via /etc/aliases and tries to send to root@example.com.\nA workaround is adding MAILTO=david at the top of each cron file. But there are many. Another workaround is to setup root@example.com as a real inbox that forwards to david@example.com. Is there a better way? I.e. is there a way to relay emails that have local domains but still process their addressee with /etc/aliases?\n\nA: I guess you could use a virtual alias.\nIf example.com is your domain on postfix:\nin /etc/postfix/main.cf\n\nvirtual_alias_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/virtual\n\nin /etc/postfix/virtual\n\nroot@example.com    dave\n\nafter editing\n\npostmap hash:/etc/postfix/virtual\n\nIt should be working.\nIf I understood your question correctly, emails to root@example.com will now go to local user dave.\n\nA: Another solution is to use the recipient_canonical_maps configuration parameter of postfix. Compared to the virtual_alias_maps, the advantage is that myorigin neither needs to be in mydestination nor in virtual_mailbox_maps (which virtual_alias_domains defaults to). Thus, this postfix instance does not become the final destination for myorigin.\nAdd this to your main.cf:\nrecipient_canonical_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/recipient_canonical\n\nThen create a file named /etc/postfix/recipient_canonical and enter something like this:\nroot@example.com david@example.com\n\nFinally hash it.\n# postmap /etc/postfix/recipient_canonical\n\n\nA: if david is also a local account, then you could have the alias line be local-only, and then set up the david account to do the forwarding.  /etc/aliases would be:\nroot: david\n\nYou could then use other postfix rules or a .forward file on the david account to get the mail to gmail.  \n", "Q: Where is the ACPI log? Sometimes my computer shuts down unexpectedly, usually when some process is taxing the CPU. This answer mentions that \"when a system shuts down in a normal way, it is either a user with root privileges or an acpi script\", and \"an acpi shutdown can be caused by power button press, overheating or low battery (laptop).\" So my guess is that it was overheating, but I'd like to be sure.\nA comment in the question linked above says that /var/log/acpid would contain some information, but that file doesn't exist on my machine. Does that log get placed somewhere else in Ubuntu? Do I need to configure something to make it show up?\n\n\n*\n\n*Note: the methods suggested here didn't return any relevant information (dmesg | grep -i acpi didn't return timestamps, and /var/log/kern.log didn't have any entries for the period when the computer shut down). I found these relevant entries in /var/log/syslog, but would like something cleaner/more informative, which I assume acpid would provide — if I could find it...\n\n\nA: While I'm not sure what more info you are looking for, your pastebin seem to provide your answer.  There are several logs that show high CPU temps.  The BIOS will shut the computer down if the CPU's get to hot to protect them from  burning out.  The overheating could be caused by several things:\n\n\n*\n\n*The CPU fan could be dirty or not running at speed\n\n*The case fan could be dirty or not running at speed\n\n*If it is a laptop, the vents tend to get clogged with dirt and hair \n\n*The heat-sink on the CPU could be dirty and clogged\n\n*The thermal compound between your CPU and the heat-sink could be old and dried out so it is not transferring the heat like it should\n\n\nIn short I would appear from your logs that the system is shutting down due to overheating. The fact that this only happens when you are doing CPU intensive programs also strongly suggests that (in fact that was my first thought before I read your pastebin)\nYou can likely clean it yourself if you're careful: clean the outside vents with a dry toothbrush.  If you open the case make sure that you don't have any static buildup on your body (touch something metal to discharge it), as any static electric spark can fry electronic chips.  The best way to clean the inside of the case is with air, most stores sell canned air just for this purpose in the electronic section.  If you use an air compressor, make sure the pressure is turned way down.  Blow air into the fans and the heat-sink until the dust and hair is gone, make sure to blow off the motherboard afterwards, to clean off any dust you blew onto it.  Just make sure that the power is OFF before you open the case — I recommend unplugging it!!\nIf the computer is old enough that the thermal compound is bad, you can buy one of those at electronics stores, but if you are unsure that you can replace it, I would recommend letting a shop do it for you.  If it is done wrong, at best the problem will continue, at worst it could kill the CPU.\nI realize that this doesn't answer your question, but it may solve your problem.  I'm not sure there is one: if the system shut down due to overheating, I'm not sure you would get much more info that a hardware error, and that you are already showing in you posted log...\nIn fact the post you linked to says just that in the accepted answer:\n\nRecently I had a system that started repeatedly to power off\n  ungracefully, turned out that it was overheating and the mobo was\n  configured to just power off early. The system didn't have a chance to\n  save logs, but fortunately monitoring the system's temperature showed\n  it was starting to increase just before powering off.\n\n", "Q: How to make an executable require root password?

I would like to be able to unhide the Xfce panel by pressing a key instead of placing the mouse cursor at the edge of the screen.\nI'm running Xubuntu 12.04 but updated to Xfce 4.10\n\nA: Try this workaround:\nInstall xte and xdotool with sudo apt-get install xdotool xautomation \nYou can use xdotool to find the x,y coordinates of the mouse.  Open a terminal type xdotool getmouselocation then move the mouse somewhere where it will activate the panel and hit enter.  You will get some output like:  \nfindclient: 62914741\nfindclient: 6291474  \nx:1282 y:1079 screen:0 window:62914741  \n\nWhat's important here is: x:1282 y:1079, which gives us the x,y coordinates of the mouse.  \nNow type xte 'mousemove 1282 1079' (replacing 1282 1079 with the coordinates you got earlier).  That should move the mouse where you want.  \nYou can use xbindkeys to bind this command to a key on the keyboard.

But I'm new here, not enough reputation..\n\nA: I know I'm a couple of years late to the party, but just for anyone who might see this in the future: Here is a bash script that toggles autohide in the new system, simply save this in a text file somewhere, run chmod +x file/that/i/saved and set the script to a key in Settings -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts.\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncur=$(xfconf-query -c xfce4-panel -p /panels/panel-0/autohide-behavior)\nif [[ cur -eq 0 ]]; then\n  nxt=1\nelse\n  nxt=0\nfi\nxfconf-query -c xfce4-panel -p /panels/panel-0/autohide-behavior -s $nxt\n\n\nA: topisani's script above still works well in xfce 4.12. \nYou can change the target panel by changing panel-0 in the script to panel-1 or panel-2 etc. Don't forget that there are two lines to change.\n\nA: Take the following commands and bind them to separate Super-key combinations:\nCommands for Xfce 4.12 through Xfce 4.14:\nThe following commands are now used to set the auto-hide properties:\nxfconf-query -c xfce4-panel -p /panels/panel-0/autohide-behavior -s 0\nxfconf-query -c xfce4-panel -p /panels/panel-0/autohide-behavior -s 1 \nxfconf-query -c xfce4-panel -p /panels/panel-0/autohide-behavior -s 2\n\nCommands for Xfce 4.10:\nxfconf-query -c xfce4-panel -p /panels/panel-0/autohide -s false\nxfconf-query -c xfce4-panel -p /panels/panel-0/autohide -s true\n\nUpdate: 12/09/2018: As mentioned in the comments, the above commands are no longer supported.\nCommand Values:\nThe value '0' is used for 'never' auto-hide. Value '1' is for 'intelligently' auto-hiding the panel, and '2' is used to set the value to 'always' auto-hide. \nSetting the key-bindings:\nThis can be done by either selecting, Applications Menu → Settings → Keyboard → Application Shortcuts, or by running xfce4-keyboard-settings from the command line(Ctrl+Alt+t).\nI've bound the first command to Super+u (to 'unhide' the panel). For the second command, I am binding Super+h (to 'hide' the panel).\nAs you can see in the commands above, the behavior is only changed on a single panel(In this case, panel-0 is being modified).\nYou may notice a slight delay while the panel changes state.\nMore details on the xfconf-query command can be found in the Xfce documentation or from this thread in the Xfce forum.\n\nA: EDIT:\nIt's been pointed out in a comment that the autohide property has been changed to something else, and -T doesn't work with the new one :/\n\nSo, while I was fooling around with  this, I made a little ruby script to toggle all panels at the same time.

But the best behavior was with 3. changing x window state. Script example:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#command will get several uids (if there are 2 panels then probably 2).

I just added an old IDE drive I had lying around to my desktop, and I used a LiveUSB to install Ubuntu 12.10 onto it. When I partitioned, I manually added the partition to the IDE HDD, since I didn't want to overwrite my Xubuntu install; when I chose the drive to install grub on, I decided to try selecting the SATA HDD, since it already had my Xubuntu install (and grub) on it.\nThis didn't work, since at the end of the installation it gave me a fatal error, saying it couldn't install grub on the drive.

The problem is that I allocated ~ 100GiB to what I thought would be a shared media storage directory; this was placed in an extended partition (sda4), comprised of ~ 7GiB in a swap file (sda5) and ~ 100GiB in an ext4 storage partition (sda6), respectively.  I no longer require this partitioning and am now looking to allocate this sda6 space more judiciously.\nAs I understand it, I need to be able to have unallocated space in a partition next to the partition that I would like to add space to.  There I have a problem, as I need to move ~55GiB from sda6 (ext4) to sda2 (NTFS).  Please note that sda1 is a small NTFS Windows boot partition and sda3 is my ext4 Ubuntu install partition that does not have any unallocated space (at present), and only 22GiB unused.\nLastly, I am presently in GParted off of a USB boot and have a pending operation of shrinking /dev/sda6/ from 99.96GiB to 44.18GiB, but alas, I cannot add to sda2 as was my intention.

I'm not actually sure if the changes you'll need to make to sda4 are doable without doing some number crunching and fdisk magic (unless gParted can do it for you). Most of these operations I would consider dangerous for a beginner or even intermediate user, so you probably don't want to do that.\nSo your safest and easiest choice is: get a spare hard drive, do the partitioning right this time, and then copy all your data over (use rsync for Linux partitions and ntfsclone for NTFS partitions). Finally copy over your MBR and you should be all set. A 320GB hard drive is pretty cheap nowadays anyways.\nThere's a good guide here on how to do the copy.\n", "Q: Unity bar and Menu bar Gone I have a bootable usb stick that has Ubuntu 12.10 on it, so I loaded it onto my computer which is semi old because it was really full and ubuntu is nice software when it works.

I'm going to install Windows and I don't want it's partition to be mounted when Ubuntu starts. How do I do this?\nAlso, are Ubuntu partitions mounted on Windows startup?\n\nA: If you are installing Windows after you have installed Ubuntu, then Ubuntu probably won't automount your Windows drives. I can't imagine you're doing this, though, because Windows would overwrite your Ubuntu bootloader (GRUB), and you'd need your Ubuntu install disc to fix that. However, assuming that it does automatically mount your Windows partitions, it's easy to fix:\nOpen a terminal and type ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid. You will see a long list of hexadecimal numbers linked to a physical partition address such as /dev/sda1. Do you know which is your windows partition? You can check by typing sudo fdisk -l and seeing which partition is listed as NTFS. Make a note of what the UUID of this disk partition is as listed in /dev/disk/by-uuid.\nThen, edit the filesystem tab by typing gksu gedit /etc/fstab. You will see that partition UUID listed in this file as being mounted type ntfs. If you insert symbol # before each partition that is mounted as NTFS, save, and reboot, none of your Windows partitions will be mounted under Ubuntu unless you explicitly mount them as the root user.\nBe very careful when editing the /etc/fstab file. If you comment out the wrong line using the # symbol, your Ubuntu system may become unbootable. Do not put the symbol before any filesystem that is mounted as type ext3, ext4, swap, or proc - these are used by your Ubuntu installation and must be mounted at boot time. \n\nA: You don't have to worry about this.\n\n\n*\n\n*If Windows and Ubuntu are installed side-by-side, so each has its own partitions, then regardless of which was installed first, Ubuntu will not automatically mount the partitions from the Windows system unless you configure it to do so yourself.\nYou will, however, see those partitions in the list of devices in Nautilus (the file manager). You can mount them easily, with a single click. But they are not mounted automatically.\n\n*Without installing special, third-party drivers, every version of Windows so far is completely incapable of mounting Ubuntu's partitions. (They are ext4 unless you manually specify a different filesystem type during installation. Even if you do, when Ubuntu and Windows are installed side-by-side, Ubuntu is incapable of installing to any type of partition Windows is capable of reading.)\nThe Windows partition would be automatically mounted if this were a Wubi system. If you had used Ubuntu's Windows installer to install it to a rewriteable disk image stored in a Windows  system's partition, then Ubuntu would be automatically configured to mount the Windows partition as /host. In that case, you could manually edit /etc/fstab and remove the entry for /host (along the lines of what Aaron D suggested).\nBut since your Ubuntu system was installed before Windows was installed, we know it could not have been installed inside Windows. So this is definitely not a Wubi system.\nTL;DR:\n\n\n*\n\n*When an Ubuntu system is installed on separate partitions from Windows, it won't mount Windows's partitions without user action.\n\n*A Wubi system automatically mounts the containing partition of its host Windows system.\n\n*Windows cannot mount any volume on which Ubuntu is installed, without extensive user action.\n\n", "Q: Sharing partitions between Ubuntu and Windows \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do i share my files from windows 7 to Ubuntu? \n\nI'm going to install W7 and Ubuntu 12.04.1, and my partition tab will look like this:\nTOTAL HD SPACE: 320GB\n\n\n*\n\n*120GB - Windows (15GB for the system, the rest for my games)\n\n*28GB  - Ubuntu /\n\n*150GB - Separate partition for sharing documents (music, videos, private files etc)\n\n\nA: Go ahead and install. \nMake 150GB  as ntfs so that it can be seen in both windows and ubuntu.\nFor details please refer to Can I change file systems inside of partitions within GParted?\n", "Q: Installing a previous version of a package when you don't have the .deb available?

I am trying to accomplish a task that may, or may not, require a creative solution. Essentially, I want to run my own DHCPd and, more importantly, DNS for my home network.\nI want to run my own Name Server for the purpose of having *.local names assigned to our various computers and devices. \nI want to run my own DHCP Server so that any computers or devices that access our network will use my name server automatically. My cable modem does not offer this functionality and my \"routers\" are setup as \"dumb\" access points.\nFor example, I don't expect my mother (no offense to moms) to remember an IP Address when she wants to view something shared over the network; or, my sibling may want to play a game on a custom LAN server.\nThe problem I must absolutely avoid is leaving this system in the hands of other people who live in the building. If the cable modem crashes, they can simply call the Cable Company or restart it when I'm not available. If the Linux system crashes, I need the computers and devices to still retain full access to the Web.\nI would like to avoid any ugly solutions such as manually editing 'hosts' files on every device that may ever use the network. \nI've tried one application and protocol that would generate *.local domains for each system but it didn't work.

I'm sure I'm not the first person to want custom names on a LAN without leaving administration up to people who are neither willing or able. Thanks.\nNote: Please do not argue any points related to the usage of TLDs. I understand the risks.\n\nA: Can you run the DHCP from your cable modem, and configure it to send out the DNS servers as:\n\n\n*\n\n*1st DNS server: Your home DNS server\n\n*2nd DNS server: Your ISP's first DNS server\n\n\nMost routers I've had allow you to at least modify the DNS servers they announce over DHCP, and create static IP allocations for its DHCP server.  I've done both of the above and never had a need to create a separate DHCP daemon on a home server.\nAlso, this way you won't have two DHCP servers on the same local network competing against each other for who gets to be in charge of any newly connected device.\n", "Q: Unable to synchronize time using NTP When I try to synchronize time using NTP.

Once recognized, the user attempts to correct the time with sudo ntpdate -b pool.ntp.org or similar only to discover that NTP is already running and simply didn't work.\nIn the general case, NTP simply cannot be trusted to correct your clock at DST transitions.  For example, NTP has cases in which it will refuse to set your clock.  You get tons of hits when searching for NTP problems, so clearly the limitations of NTP have affected many people.  I'm sure there are solid reasons for any NTP design decision, but that doesn't change the fact that it can't be trusted to always do what the average user would expect.\nBe sure to check up on it if is important to you for some specific purpose.  You may have greater luck with an automatic DST transition if you manually set the correct time shortly prior to the transition.\nThis is a hard problem for the average user to experiment with, since DST only happens at two instances per year.\n\nA: If the ntp deamen is installed and running, you would get the same error as you can't adjust the clock via two program at the same time.\nIf the service is running, it will sync to the servers that are in /etc/ntp.conf so time will be sync.\nIt is better to restart ntp daemon every night so that if it stop somehow gets start everyday, set it in crontab.\ncrontab -e\n@daily sudo service ntp restart >> /tmp/time.log\n\nyou can check the details of your server sync via below command\nntpq -p\n\n", "Q: several indicators not visible on panel in ubuntu 12.10 I installed everpad on my ubuntu 12.10 (which was a upgraded from ubuntu 12.04).

Given that you've successfully downloaded the ISO image:\nTo Install a Normal (non-Wubi) Ubuntu System Alongside Windows, via USB\n\n*\n\n*Run UNetbootin or Universal USB Installer to install the ISO to the USB flash drive. Whichever you use, you'll run the program, then in the program you'll fill in some information, including telling it where to find the ISO image you've downloaded. Double-clicking on the ISO itself will not work.\n\n\n*If your backups of documents and other important files are not current, update them. (Or if you don't have any backups--I've found people occasionally don't--make one.) There is a small but significant chance of data loss when modifying your partition layout (which happens as part of installation).\n\n\n*Reboot, with the USB flash drive attached. Make sure your Windows system shuts down completely and cleanly. In particular, if it crashed, boot back into it and let it try to fix whatever might be wrong. (Unless it always crashes and never shuts down cleanly, in which case there's nothing you can do.) Make sure you're rebooting or shutting down...not hibernating.\n\n\n*Depending on how your BIOS is configured, when your computer starts it might automatically boot from the USB drive, or you might have to tell it to do so by bringing up the BIOS boot menu. They key to press for this varies depending on manufacturer. Dells use F12. Usually your computer tells you, at least briefly, what key to press to access the boot menu.\n\n\n*Select Try Ubuntu (if you want to test out Ubuntu from the live USB first, which I recommend) or Install Ubuntu. If you select Try Ubuntu, you can install it by double-clicking the Install Ubuntu icon on the desktop in the live environment.\n\n\n*When the installer runs, tell it to install Ubuntu alongside existing operating systems. This will shrink down your Windows partition and create partitions for Ubuntu. (It is usually able to do this; making sure Windows shut down cleanly increases the odds of success. If it doesn't work, you may have to go back into Windows and turn off swap and hibernation. You can reenable them after installing Ubuntu, and you should, at least the swap. I don't recommend turning these things off at all unless you need to.)\nDo not tell it to install using the entire disk, unless you want to overwrite the Windows system (destroying it and data inside it--it's very hard and often impossible to recover the old data in this situation).\nI recommend keeping the Windows system for now. Having it doesn't obligate you to use it, and even if you know you prefer Ubuntu, having the old OS can be a valuable \"safety net.\" (If your Windows system were seriously broken, such that it could not really be used for anything, then I would not be advising this.)\n\n\n*Assuming everything worked correctly, when you reboot, you will be able to choose between Ubuntu and Windows.

Is there a way to turn this off and to allow the non-admin user to connect to whatever Wifi network they like?\nEDIT: just to clarify, I really mean a new WiFi network never connected to prior by the computer, so clicking 'Available to all users' on an existing established connection will not solve the matter- as currently no issue with the non-admin user reconnecting as many times as they like to the home network.\n\nA: You can also create a local policy for this\n\n[Let user pupil modify system settings for network]\nIdentity=unix-user:pupil\nAction=org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.settings.modify.system\nResultAny=no\nResultInactive=no\nResultActive=yes\n\nin a file called /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/10-network-manager.pkla. \nThe advantage here is this can be a single command and usable in a script!\n\nprintf \"[Let user pupil modify system settings for network]\\nIdentity=unix-user:pupil\\nAction=org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.settings.modify.system\\nResultAny=no\\nResultInactive=no\\nResultActive=yes\" | sudo tee /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/10-network-manager.pkla\n\nReference: Ubuntu Manpage:pklocalauthority\n\nA: You can edit system configuration files, but that's brute force. First of all, as a rule of thumb, configuration resides under /etc, not /usr or /var or anywhere else. HarlemSquirrel explained how to do a proper change to the default policy. Editing files under /usr is guaranteed to blow up in your face sooner or later, as those files are provided by system packages, which will be updated/replaced eventually.\nBut the bigger problem is that these changes are completely unnecessary, as of 18.04 at least. This is a \"you're holding it wrong\" issue. Actually, it's a usability issue on the NM applet's part, but anyway. Take a look at /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.policy:\n  <action id=\"org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.settings.modify.system\">\n    <description>Modify network connections for all users</description>\n    <defaults>\n      <allow_any>auth_admin_keep</allow_any>\n      <allow_inactive>auth_admin_keep</allow_inactive>\n      <allow_active>auth_admin_keep</allow_active>\n    </defaults>\n  </action>\n\nMeaning users can't create connections, right? Wrong! Look further:\n  <action id=\"org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.settings.modify.own\">\n    <description>Modify personal network connections</description>\n    <defaults>\n      <allow_any>auth_self_keep</allow_any>\n      <allow_inactive>yes</allow_inactive>\n      <allow_active>yes</allow_active>\n    </defaults>\n  </action>\n\nAs you can see, NetworkManager supports the concept of user and system connections. The problem is, the applet creates system connections by default. So when you open the applet on the tray and click Select Network, then select the one you want to connect to, it asks for a sudo user, because creating system connections are only allowed for admins.\nBUT if you open the Settings app, go to Wi-Fi and click on the desired network, it'll easily let you connect without admin password. Walk in the park. \nWhy the applet wants to create system connections by default is beyond me though, especially since you can make a user connection a system one anytime later. It's the Make available to other users option under connection properties, and when you check that and click Apply, it'll immediately ask for sudo password, as it should. I'll try to find a way to make the applet create user connections by default, I'll update this answer if I figured it out.\n\nA: How To Resolve the Error: System policy prevents modification of network settings for all users\nThere is a critical step missing from an answer above, so I am including it here. :)\nThis works in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS & 16.04 LTS\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*su to root\nsu -\n\n\n*Type the following:\nnano /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.policy\n\n\n*Towards the end of the file, find the section labeled:\n<action id=\"org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.settings.modify.system\">\n\n\n*At the the bottom of the org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.settings.modify.system Section, locate the following line of code:\n<allow_active>auth_admin_keep</allow_active>\n\n\n*Change this line to read as follows:\n<allow_active>yes</allow_active>\n\n\n*Save the file using:\n^X\n\n\n*Answer \"Save modified buffer (ANSWERING \"No\" WILL DESTROY CHANGES) ?\" by Typing:\nY\n\n\n*Hit Enter when prompted with:\nFile Name to Write: /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.policy\n\n\n*Restart.\n:)\n\nA: This isn't really the fix I was hoping for but one workaround I've found is just to disable NetworkManager all-together and instead use Wicd.\nFirst stop NetworkManager from running at startup:\nsudo gedit /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\nthen # out the managed line.

I tried this several times, even deleting the profile, and it showed up once on the Firefox interface, but completely empty.\nAnyways, that's only for a user, and I want to add them system-wide. Is there a system-wide database I can modify? How?\nIf there is no system-wide database I can modify, I can rely on a X start script (as /etc/X11/Xsession.d/ ones, or a script called by the xdg autostart system on /etc/xdg/autostart/) to modify the user profile at session start, but I need a solution that works. I can't even load certificates on the user profiles from the command line now!\n\nA: The problem here is that Firefox does not have a 'central' location where it looks for certificates. It just looks into the current profile. That's why modifying /usr/share/ca-certificates or other similar directories won't work with Firefox. This is something that has been requested for years; see issues 620373, 449498 and 454036 (and probably there are many others).\nSo you are left with just two kind of solutions: either modify each profile, or modify the behaviour of Firefox. I know this is not what you are looking for, but there are no ways because Firefox only looks at users' profiles.\nHaving said that, the solution I would choose is using hard or symbolic links, specifically I'd go with hardlinks. This solution is surely the easiest and probably the better, though I don't have enough information to judge.\nWhat you have to do is basically removing each cert8.db and key3.db files for each profile and replace them with links to the \"most complete\" cert8.db and key3.db. If you go with hardlinks, the original cert8.db and key3.db will be indistinguishable from the new ones.\nRemember to adjust permissions to fit your needs. Most likely, you will need to chmod a+rw so that everybody will be able to add/remove a certificate. If you want only certain users to be able to add/remove certificates, you can create a group, assign the two databases to that group and give +w permission just to the group.\n\nA: The easiest way is to import the certificate into a sample firefox-profile and then copy the cert8.db to the users you want equip with the certificate.\nFirst import the certificate by hand into the firefox profile of the sample-user. Then copy \n/home/${USER}/.mozilla/firefox/${randomalphanum}.default/cert8.db\n\ninto the users firefox-profiles. That's it. If you want to make sure, that new users get the certificate automatically, copy cert8.db to:\n/etc/firefox-3.0/profile\n\n\nHere is an alternative way that doesn't override the existing certificates:\n[bash fragment for linux systems]\ncertificateFile=\"MyCa.cert.pem\"\ncertificateName=\"MyCA Name\" \nfor certDB in $(find  ~/.mozilla* ~/.thunderbird -name \"cert8.db\")\ndo\n  certDir=$(dirname ${certDB});\n  #log \"mozilla certificate\" \"install '${certificateName}' in ${certDir}\"\n certutil -A -n \"${certificateName}\" -t \"TCu,Cuw,Tuw\" -i ${certificateFile} -d ${certDir}\ndone\n\nYou may find certutil in the libnss3-tools package (debian/ubuntu).\nSee also: Programmatic import of CA Certificate\nSource: Programmatically Install Certificate into Mozilla\n\nA: Found this solution to add certificates to firefox on ubuntu :\nhttps://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates/#proxy\nSimply need to add this file to :\n/usr/lib/firefox/distribution/\n\ntouch policies.json\n\nIn policies.json add:\n{\n\"policies\": {\n\"Certificates\": {\n    \"ImportEnterpriseRoots\": true,\n    \"Install\": [\n               \"somecert1.crt\",\n               \"usr/local/share/ca-certificates/somecert1.crt\"\n               ]\n         }\n    }\n}\n\nThe install part is first the name of the cert and then the path. And restart firefox. If something doesn't work try resetting firefox as if you have set something before it can stuck it.\nThis method works good without certutil.\n\nA: Contrary to popular belief, you can get Firefox to look at the system certificates instead its own hard-coded set. \nTo do this, you will want to use a package called p11-kit. p11-kit provides a drop-in replacement for libnssckbi.so, the shared library that contains the hardcoded set of certificates. The p11-kit version instead reads the certificates from the system certificate store. \nSince Firefox ships with its own version of libnssckbi.so, you'll need to track it down and replace it instead of the version provided in libnss3:\nsudo mv /usr/lib/firefox/libnssckbi.so /usr/lib/firefox/libnssckbi.so.bak\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/pkcs11/p11-kit-trust.so /usr/lib/firefox/libnssckbi.so\n\nNext, delete the ~/.pki directory to get Firefox to refresh its certificate database (causing it to pull in the system certs) upon restarting Firefox. Note: this will delete any existing certificates in the store, so if have custom ones that you added manually, you might want to back up that folder and then re-import them. \n\nA: One of the features of the CCK Wizard Firefox add-on is importing CA certs. I use this add-on to create a custom add-on that includes a company CA Cert. I then package the custom xpi in a .deb on the internal repository that all the workstations get updates from.\nCCK Wizard\nEDIT: In order to package the xpi for Ubuntu, you need to create a package that includes the directory /usr/lib/firefox-addons/extensions/[addon-name@servername] and unzip the entire contents of the xpi into this directory. For instance if you name your addon foobarbaz and the server you have it set to update from (if you were to enable that function) is intranet.example.com, then the directory would be foobarbaz@intranet.example.com. I never enable the auto update, but instead update the deb in the repo. \n\nA: Firefox works after a clean installation. If certificate database in cert8.db is deleted, it is regenerated on next Firefox start. This strongly suggests that there is a system-wide default storage of CA certs.\nFirefox's source code shows that built-in CA certs are in fact hard-coded into firefox executable. They reside in security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt\nSo there is no way to install a certificate system-wide. Beware that patching source code may bring up issues with intellectual property rights.\n\nA: I am using a \"User Environment Virtualization\" (UEV) application that does this for my users, but you can do this with logon scripts in Windows clients just the same.  I won't post all of the code to dynamically find the %APPDATA%\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\%PROFILE% path, but when you do find it, you can import the scripts using some basic commands.  I am basically reading the Firefox profiles.ini file to determine the path to the Firefox profile/cert8.db.\nYou may want to look at using the certutil.exe application.  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/tools/NSS_Tools_certutil\nYou can run logon scripts for users that automatically imports the trusted certs from a central location into the Firefox of all users on the system.\nHere is the \"core\" of my certificate import vb script:\nIf Instr(strLine,\"Path=Profiles/\") Then\n  arrLine = Split(strLine, \"/\")\n  strProfile = strAppData & \"\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\\" & arrLine(1)\n  strCertDB = strProfile & \"\\cert8.db\"\n\n  'Verify the DB exists, if not move to the next entry\n  If objFSO.FileExists(strCertDB) Then\n    'Run certutil command on this database\n    strCertCommand1 = \"\\\\SERVERNAME\\SHARENAME$\\certs\\certutil\\certutil.exe -A \" &_\n    \"-n MYCA -t \"\"CT,C,C\"\" -d \" & strProfile & \" -i \\\\SERVERNAME\\SHARENAME$\\certs\\MYCA_Root.cer\"\n\n    strCertCommand2 = \"\\\\SERVERNAME\\SHARENAME$\\certs\\certutil\\certutil.exe -A \" &_\n    \"-n MYSECONDCA -t \"\"CT,C,C\"\" -d \" & strProfile & \" -i \\\\SERVERNAME\\SHARENAME$\\certs\\SecondCA_Root.cer\"\n\n    strCertCommand3 = \"\\\\SERVERNAME\\SHARENAME$\\certs\\certutil\\certutil.exe -A \" &_\n    \"-n MYTHIRDCA -t \"\"CT,C,C\"\" -d \" & strProfile & \" -i \\\\SERVERNAME\\SHARENAME$\\certs\\ThirdCA_Root.cer\"\n\n    'Run the import commands for this Firefox profile\n    objShell.Run(\"%comspec% /c \" & strCertCommand1),0,TRUE\n    objShell.Run(\"%comspec% /c \" & strCertCommand2),0,TRUE\n    objShell.Run(\"%comspec% /c \" & strCertCommand3),0,TRUE\n\n\nA: I found out that most of the time and by default if not configured otherwise Firefox uses legacy security databases (cert8.db, key3.db, and secmod.db)\nthat means you will need to use a different command line to inject the certificate into the correct database that Firefox use. (see more from the man of certutil)\nso if your system uses the default data base the command should go like this: (dbm)\ncertutil -A -n \"Description Name\" -t \"CT,C,C\" -d dbm:/home/<username>/.mozilla/firefox/<default folder>/ -i certificate.crt\n\notherwise it should be like this: (sql)\ncertutil -A -n \"Description Name\" -t \"CT,C,C\" -d sql:/home/<username>/.mozilla/firefox/<default folder>/ -i certificate.crt\n\nfrom man certutil:\n-d [prefix]directory\nSpecify the database directory containing the certificate and key\ndatabase files.\n\ncertutil supports two types of databases: the legacy security databases\n(cert8.db, key3.db, and secmod.db) and new SQLite databases (cert9.db,\nkey4.db, and pkcs11.txt).\n\nNSS recognizes the following prefixes:\n\n·   sql: requests the newer database\n\n·   dbm: requests the legacy database\n\nIf no prefix is specified the default type is retrieved from\nNSS_DEFAUL\n\n\nA: Beginning with Firefox 64, Mozilla says, that an own \"enterprise CA\" can be imported from those system paths in Linux:\n\n*\n\n*/usr/lib/mozilla/certificates\n\n*/usr/lib64/mozilla/certificates\nThose paths do not exist by default in Ubuntu, but can be added manually.\nAdditionally, you have to name each certificate in the file /usr/lib/firefox/distribution/policies.json, so that it gets imported automatically:\n{\n    \"policies\": {\n        \"ImportEnterpriseRoots\": true,\n        \"Certificates\": {\n            \"Install\": [\n                \"example.crt\",\n                \"/specific/folder/another-example.crt\"\n            ]\n       }\n    }\n}\n\nIn this case, a certificate file named \"example.crt\" in either of the named default directories will be added when firefox restarts.\nAs Batchen Regev showed in his answer, you can also point to a file with an absolute path.

You simple MUST have installed 12.04.1 inside that virtual machine before, else it is simple NOT POSSIBLE.\n\nA: This should not happen, if you started installation process from within virtualbox indeed. So don't erase/overwrite your real installation!\nMaybe it is a little confusing, but: your install CD is mounted twice, first in your real system, and then in your virtualbox. Both times it will present you the installer. So make sure you start the correct instance of the installer from within virtualbox. Then it is impossible that the installer sees your real ubuntu.

I've been successfully using Pidgin since it was rebranded from Gaim and it has been integrated into messaging menu in Ubuntu. \nBut now in 12.04 after uninstalling Empathy and installing Pidgin, after successfully integration in messaing menu, Pidgin-libnotify is forced to be blacklisted and stops showin in menu.\nHow?\nAfter booting system I click on Pidgin in messaging menu. It launches, but after a while Pidgin dissapears from messaging menu and in ~/.config/indicators/messages/applications-blacklist/ a file pidgin-libnotify appears. \nI've purged and installed again Pidgin and it still works as described above...\n\nA: Here is what I found out... If you open Pidgin > Tools > plugins, make sure that \"libnotify popups 0.14\" is checked.

Uncorrectable problems required a reinstall/upgrade to 12.04.  Only / was formated for the reinstall. All works, except that I have empty home on the root partition.  Can I rename this home to\"oldhome\" ?  Then I will mount untouched /home on separate partition where all my data files are located?\nIs this the best way to resolve this issue?  \n\nA: If the /home on the root partition contains files and data you want to keep, then yes. If not, then you can simply wipe it away. I recommend doing this from an Ubuntu installation disk (or administration mode if you know how to use that - you don't want to be logged into the GUI for this one on your live box).\nIf you are using the live CD environment, you will need to mount your root partition - open a terminal and type\nmkdir -p /mnt/filesystem\nmount /dev/sda1 /mnt/filesystem\n\nModify /dev/sda1 to reflect your actual root filesystem. Then in the terminal you will need to cd /mnt/filesystem as the following instructions about editing the /etc/fstab file apply to the one stored on your actual Ubuntu installation's root partition, not the one in the liveCD environment.\nYou'll need to edit the /etc/fstab file to tell it to mount your home directory disk partition to /home. On my machine, my home directory is on /dev/sda6, which uses the ext4 filesystem. So the line in my /etc/fstab file looks like this:\n/dev/sda6    /home       ext4       defaults      1  2\n\nThis tells the kernel to mount that partition in /home as ext4 (replace if you use a different filesystem), with default options (usually OK), and the 1 and 2 indicate it is to be backed up by dump (if you use that - safe to ignore otherwise) and will be checked if the system detects filesystem corruption (you probably want this).\n", "Q: My bluetooth headset is sizzle and no sound, I use 12.10 I use blueman and bluez, sometimes no sound, sometimes the headset is sizzle...\nCan anybody help me?\n\nA: The computer may not be choosing the right hardware to play.\nOpen the Sound settings (open your Dash and type sound).

I'd like to combine them into a single file, e.g. part1.flv, part2.flv, part3.flv become final.flv.\nWhat is the easiest way that I can do this without losing video quality?\n\nA: I'd suggest mencoder. This is a part of mplyaer and can be used at command line:\nmencoder -oac copy -ovc copy -o final.avi part1.flv part2.flv part3.flv\n\nNormally -oac and -ovc are for special audio and video codecs. In this case the commands says it just should (stream)copy them. The option -o gives the name of the output file.\nThe output could be forced to FLV, but this is currently buggy, and you will get the following message if you try adding -of lavf:\n\nREMEMBER: MEncoder's libavformat muxing is presently broken and can generate\n      INCORRECT files in the presence of B-frames. Moreover, due to bugs MPlayer\n      will play these INCORRECT files as if nothing were wrong!\n\nAccording to your comment you got the error:\n\nAudio format 0x4134504d is incompatible with '-oac copy', please try '-oac pcm' instead or use '-fafmttag' to override it.\n\nAccording to a blog entry this is caused by attempting to convert AAC audio. In this case you can try -oac mp3lame instead.\nOtherwise, add the option -fafmttag plus a code for your audio codec. Usually mplayer has a file etc/codecs.conf. There you'll find which code maps to which codec. This file does not always exist.\nIf this doesn't work for you, you can also recode the audio. However this is too complex to describe in this answer. You'll need to look at the manpage or ask another question here.\n", "Q: Why LXPanel 0.5.11 asks for a new dependency in Precise but not in Quantal? LXPanel 0.5.11 that is default in Lubuntu Quantal has enhanced features compared to the older version that is default in Lubuntu Precise (0.5.8). \nThe new version of LXPanel is available for Precise. But while installing that in Precise 12.04, it asks for libmenu-cache2 (that seems available only for Raring 13.04). \nInstalling that libmenu-cache2 in Precise would allow installing LXPanel 0.5.11 (for Precise). (But is it safe to install this libmenu-cache2 for Raring in 12.04? should it replace libmenu-cache1 there? it does not by default.)\nThe odd thing is that in a different computer with Lubuntu Quantal I see that LXPanel 0.5.11 works with only libmenu-cache1.\n\nA: The problem is with the way the version of a build (especially dev version) is displayed.\nIn Lubuntu Quantal, the LXPanel version that works with only libmenu-cache1 is displayed  as\n\nBut in Synaptic Manager it's 0.5.10:\n\nAlso, \n~$ apt-cache policy lxpanel\nlxpanel:\n  Installed: 0.5.10+git20120823-0ubuntu1\n  Candidate: 0.5.10+git20120823-0ubuntu1\n  Version table:\n *** 0.5.10+git20120823-0ubuntu1 0\n        500 http://fr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ quantal/universe i386 Packages\n        100 /var/lib/dpkg/status\n\nI do not know how Launchpad displayed the name of this version, but it could be a dev or otherwise improved version of 0.5.10, although I do not remember manually updating LXPanel in Quantal. \nAlso, after installing (in Lubuntu Precise) LXPanel for Precise from here, which looks like being a daily build of 0.5.11 (Launchpad named it lxpanel-dev-0.5.11~bzr1306+201301150740~precise1) (which was possible only after installing  libmenu-cache2 for Raring from here) I see that LXPanel \"About\" says version 0.5.12, while in Synaptic it was displayed 0.5.11.\nSo, the  dev version installed in Precise is not the same version as the one from the other computer running Quantal, but a newer build that asks for libmenu-cache2, while that quantal version does not.\n\nIt seems that LXPanel versions above 0.5.10 need libmenu-cache2.\n(But to see the real version of a build one must look in Synaptic or run apt-cache policy lxpanel, because dev builds might show a newer version in \"About\" section.)\n", "Q: Touchscreen and digitizer not working on Sony Vaio Duo 11 I have a Sony VAIO Duo 11 (SVD112...) which features both multi-touch and stylus input.

When the workspace is empty (there are no windows on that workspace), the only way to open the dash is clicking on the ubuntu icon in the launcher. \nIs this the expected behavior or do I have some problem?\n\nSOLUTION\nThe problem was caused because I had turned off the Desktop handling by nautilus.

Then I restarted my system. When I log in to rashmi another screen appears for less than a second and then vanish and again the login screen comes back. So I am not able to login in to Ubuntu from the newly created user\nI created my user with sudo useradd rashmi, then set its password using sudo passwd rashmi.\nCan anyone please tell me how to log in as a new user and where I am going wrong?\n\nA: By default useradd simply creates the user account and group in the /etc/passwd and /etc/group files. It does not create a home directory for the new user. Instead run the sudo adduser username command, which will prompt for extra information including password, full name, etc. and then create a home directory which will be populated from default information in /etc/skel. \nTo fix this, you have two options. The simplest would be to run sudo userdel rashmi, and then start again with the adduser command, or you could manually create the home directory as root user, and change the ownership of the copied files to match that of the new user:\nls /home/rashmi\n\nConfirm that there is no data about to be overwritten. Then\nsudo cp -a /etc/skel /home/rashmi\nsudo chown -R rashmi:rashmi /home/rashmi\n\nI recommend using the first method if possible, as it will add a usergroup for the new user, which you may not have done yet (you can do this manually by editing the /etc/group file as the root user). \n", "Q: How to set up and use a virtual python environment in Ubuntu? Python virtual environments are used to create isolated python environments to avoid dependency and version conflicts, and also indirectly take care of permission issues. But what is the easiest way to set it up, and use it, in Ubuntu?\n\nA: Virtual environments offer a way for managing and isolating dependencies on a per-project basis. Moreover, they also avoid the whole sudo pip install situation, which is a security risk as I have explained in https://askubuntu.com/a/802594/15003. The official Python documentation also encourages the use of virtual environments.\nThe easiest way to create and use virtual environments for both Python 2 and Python 3 is to install virtualenv using apt or apt-get. For each Python project, create a virtualenv and then activate it. Note that the virtualenv is specific for a particular Python version. After activation, use pip to install Python packages as usual regardless of whether you are using Python 2 or 3; there is no need to use pip3 for Python 3. sudo is only used to install virtualenv and is not used with pip, therefore avoiding the aforementioned security risk. The commands to do so are:\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install virtualenv\ncd ~/desired_directory  # cd to desired_directory\nvirtualenv venv  # create virtualenv named venv for default system Python, which is Python 2 for Ubuntu\nsource venv/bin/activate  # activate virtualenv\npip install -U pip  # upgrade pip in case it is outdated\npip install desired_package  # install desired_package\n\nIf you would like to create a virtualenv for Python 3, replace virtualenv venv with:\nvirtualenv venv -p python3\n\nRead more about various bells and whistles for virtualenv at https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/.\n\nA: It's easy, you install python-virtualenv. Then you can create a virtualenv with the virtualenv command. See their documentation for more.\n\nA: With the venv module available from Python 3.3 (and Ubuntu 15.10)\nVirtual environments (venvs) are so popular that the functionality is now included in python itself (from 3.3 onwards). To use it on Ubuntu you need to install python3-venv (since the ensurepip module is not available):\nsudo apt-get install python3-venv\n\nAfter that you can use\npyvenv myvirtualenv\n\nto create a virtual environment called myvirtualenv. You can then use\nsource myvirtualenv/bin/activate\n\nto activate the virtual environment. To deactivate simply type\ndeactivate\n\n\nEDIT: \nThe pyvenv script has been deprecated in favour of python3 -m venv. This prevents confusion as to what Python interpreter pyvenv is connected to and thus what Python interpreter will be used by the virtual environment. (source)\n\nA: With virtualenvwrapper (user friendly wrappers for the functionality of virtualenv)\nInstall virtualenv\nInstall virtualenv with\nsudo apt install virtualenv\n\nInstall virtualenvwrapper\nThe reason we are also installing virtualenvwrapper is because it offers nice and simple commands to manage your virtual environments. There are two ways to install virtualenvwrapper:\nAs Ubuntu package (from Ubuntu 16.04)\nRun\nsudo apt install virtualenvwrapper\n\nthen run\necho \"source /usr/share/virtualenvwrapper/virtualenvwrapper.sh\" >> ~/.bashrc\n\nUsing pip\n\n\n*\n\n*Install and/or update pip\nInstall pip for Python 2 with\nsudo apt install python-pip\n\nor for Python 3\nsudo apt install python3-pip\n\n(if you use Python 3, you may need to use pip3 instead of pip in the rest of this guide).  \nOptional (but recommended): Turn on bash autocomplete for pip\nRun\npip completion --bash >> ~/.bashrc\n\nand run source ~/.bashrc to enable.\n\n*Install virtualenvwrapper\nBecause we want to avoid sudo pip we install virtualenvwrapper locally (by default under ~/.local) with:\npip install --user virtualenvwrapper\n\nand\necho \"export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3\" >> ~/.bashrc\n\n\n*Source virtualenvwrapper in .bashrc\necho \"source ~/.local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh\" >> ~/.bashrc\n\nSetup virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper:\nFirst we export the WORKON_HOME variable which contains the directory in which our virtual environments are to be stored. Let's make this ~/.virtualenvs\nexport WORKON_HOME=~/.virtualenvs\n\nnow also create this directory\nmkdir $WORKON_HOME\n\nand put this export in our ~/.bashrc file so this variable gets automatically defined\necho \"export WORKON_HOME=$WORKON_HOME\" >> ~/.bashrc\n\nWe can also add some extra tricks like the following, which makes sure that if pip creates an extra virtual environment, it is also placed in our WORKON_HOME directory:\necho \"export PIP_VIRTUALENV_BASE=$WORKON_HOME\" >> ~/.bashrc \n\nSource ~/.bashrc to load the changes\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nTest if it works\nNow we create our first virtual environment. The -p argument is optional, it is used to set the Python version to use; it can also be python3 for example.\nmkvirtualenv -p python2.7 test\n\nYou will see that the environment will be set up, and your prompt now includes the name of your active environment in parentheses. Also if you now run\npython -c \"import sys; print sys.path\"\n\nyou should see a lot of /home/user/.virtualenv/... because it now doesn't use your system site-packages.\nYou can deactivate your environment by running\ndeactivate\n\nand if you want to work on it again, simply type\nworkon test\n\nFinally, if you want to delete your environment, type\nrmvirtualenv test\n\nEnjoy!\n\nThanks to the author of this blogpost.\n", "Q: We need a printer for ubuntu 12.10.

There is question about this matter but it is closed for being too specific . I think this is a general issue about Sony Vaio laptops with nVidia graphics. I had this problem when I used 10.04 and it still exists on 12.04. Since this is too annoying I just duplicate that question by picheto:\n\"I'm using Google Chrome version 21.0.1180.89 on Ubuntu 12.04 and my laptop is a Sony VAIO VPCCW15FL (spec sheet). My video driver is the propietary \"NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (post-release updates)(version-current updates)\".\nAfter installing Ubuntu, I discovered that neither the brightness control buttons (hardware) or the brightness slider (software) worked, and found out I could get the hardware buttons to work by installing the nvidiabl.deb package and oBacklight script. I'm using nvidiabl-dkms 0.77 and oBacklight 0.3.8. Still, the slider on the Ubuntu \"Settings\" does not work, but I don't care.\nThere is an annoying thing happening when loading certain pages in Google Chrome: the brightness goes up to 100% when loading the webpage or when leaving it (closing the tab or typing a different URL on the omnibox). However, the \"brightness tooltip\" (that default brightness notification) remembers the position it was set to, so if I adjust the brightness with the HW buttons, the level gets adjusted relative to the value it was set to before \"going 100%\".\nI disabled the flash PPAPI plugin, but left the NPAPI plugin enabled, and the problem went away for pages with flash content. Still, the same thing happens when viewing HTML5 video, or when loading, for example, the Chrome Web Store or using the Scratchpad extension. I suppose it has to do with the rendering of certain elements using the GPU, but this is just a guess.\nThis brightness thing does not happen when using Firefox 15.0 or any other application I have used yet.\nDoes anybody know why this may be happening and what could I do to fix this without changing browser?

I tried to recreate this issue and now I can't remove the failed recovery screen.\nThe way to fix it is to hit cancel on the recovery screen, instead of trying (and failing) the recovery (source). Works for me.\n\nA: This problem seems to appear in Ubuntu 12.04.\nOf course you can cancel the recovery process but that's not a solution because you will have to do it every time you start LibreOffice, even after having closed all documents properly after the last session.\nThe bug is caused by the package lo-menubar that offers HUD functionality for LibreOffice.\nSo the real solution of the problem is sudo apt-get remove lo-menubar.\n\nA: A better solution, without messing with any configuration, set-up or so, is to write again a file with the same name in the same place.\n\n\n*\n\n*Open LibreOffice Writer (or Calc or any LO program) normally and cancel the recovery process.

Then a surprise query opens and offers to save any unsaved files with a new name... and the \"rescue\" window doesn't come back! \n\nA: So I have been looking for an answer to the same thing and the best solution I have found is to change the open command for each of the apps\nInstructions\nnavigate to /usr/share/applications\nfind the files for the libreOffice apps\nfor me it was these four\nLibreOffice App Files\nright click and select properties and add --norestore to the Command\nAdd To Command\n\nA: I had the same problem.\nI did hit recovery and when it complete the process, I hit \"ESC\" instead other buttons.\nThis way it opened the App with the recoverd file and I was able to save it now it is working correctly. \nPS: hitting \"ESC\" in the first recovery pop-up window worked but I got to do this every time I open the App.\n\nA: This has happened to me a few times with no cancel button in the file recovery dialog box.

How can I format this free space to fat/ntfs so I can use it for other things?\nThanks!\n\nA: Probably the easiest way would be to format the whole drive, hence also deleting the current Ubuntu partition on the USB. \nYou do that by using Gparted, an app which are available for free download through the Ubuntu Software Center.\nWhen open in Gparted, you choose the USB-drive in the upper right corner of the app.\nThen you right-click on the current partition and choose erase (has to be unmounted first), then click \"Apply\". \nAfter that the whole USB drive will be seen as \"Unallocated Space\". \nNow right-click on the Unallocated space and choose \"Create new Partition\" (or similar), and choose the new partition size (the one for Ubuntu has to be around 1 GB and fat32)\nRepeat the process to create all the partitions you want. \nNow use the USB-startdisk-creator which comes with the default Ubuntu installation (seach USB in the dash). \nSelect to install Ubuntu on only the partition you created for it. \nNow you will have a partition for the Ubuntu-bootable and one that is empty\n\nA: If you were only using 790 MB for Ubuntu, the system was probably already FAT32.

To access the data while booted on the device go to filesystem/cdrom as root.\nYou can also do a Full install to the drive using manual partitioning and make the first partition FAT32 and the second partition / using ext4.\n\nA: This is an old question, but the problem may still be relevant for new users.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you have used the drive to test and/or install Ubuntu and want to restore it to a standard storage device, you can\n\n\n*\n\n*in Windows: use the formatting tool (with a graphical user interface)\n\n*in Ubuntu: use mkusb and select 'Restore to a standard storage device' or use gparted\n\n\n*If you want to use the drive space while running Ubuntu live, you can create a persistent live drive with Ubuntu according to this link and links from it.\n", "Q: How can I easily create a GUI dialog with a bash script? I need to present some text along with the items(about 15 values) for each of two Bash list(file) records.  On the same screen  I need to present a three way selection, (buttons, scrolled selection window, etc.).\nI'm an Ubuntu(11.04) scripting noob just beginning to use Zenity in scripts. My friends suggested YAD.  \nCan I do all of that in YAD or use some other easy GUI tool unknown to us?\n.\n\nA: Here's a very minimal implementation in Yad.\nA textfile named 'mylist' in the same directory as the script contains \"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\". A space character is the default delimeter for input into lists.\nThe example script is:\n#/bin/bash\nthelist=$(<mylist)\nthechoice=$(yad --title=\"Choose a value\" --width=200 --height=200 --list --column=\"Values\" --separator=\"\" $thelist)\nexit $(yad --title=\"You chose...\" --text=$thechoice)\n\nThat's it. Scrolling the list is handled automatically. The --separator=\"\" is to supress Yad's default of appending a pipe character (\"|\") to the output. \nWhen you read the man page, you will see that you have a large array of possibilites. You can add buttons, icons, radio buttons, etc. You can create tabbed dialogs by using Yad's Notebook feature to embed dialogs within other dialogs as plugins.\nThere's a long example at PCLinusOS mag and some interesting shorter examples at the Yad site.\n\nA: for simple dialogs Yad or kdialog are indeed the most featureful.\nA complete GUI for bash, however,  can only be done by two programs I know of: \ngtkdialog (https://code.google.com/p/gtkdialog) will give you a full fledged frontend for single programs and is probably what you are looking for in the first place if yad turns out to be  not enough for your needs.\nThe other one is gtkserver (http://www.gtk-server.org) which is a seperate running GUI-server. Your bash application can communicate with it by means of pipes, messages or TCP-sockets which is quite convenient if you are planning a complex setup of scripts/applications with a single central interface. I think that it will be a bit over the top for your current project :-)  \n\nA: Some Zenity examples, just in case someone wants to stick with it.\nThis will create a \"Hello world\" message box:\nzenity --info --text \"Saluton mondo\"\n\nThis will create a list populated with the output of ls:\nls /var/log | zenity --list --column=\"Files and directories\"\n\n\nA: Here is a very nice example, how to create a zenity dialog with multiple inputs.\n\nDifferent UI types (Checkbox, Date, Colorpicker, etc) are documented here.\nand as far as I can tell: zenity is installed out of the Box in Ubuntu 20.04 and larger.\n", "Q: How do I change hyperlink colours in LibreOffice Impress?

I need a new Mac for some specific OSX requirements that I need 1% of the time but for the rest of the time I need Ubuntu, I usually I stick to the LTS releases. I am open to the Mac mini, Macbook air, Macbook Retina, iMac, whichever is most likely to give me the least amount of frustration in terms of hardware compatibility. I'm not concerned about cost or any other factor. I want to run Ubuntu on bare metal, not within a VM. Any advice?\n\nA: Here's the deal there is no answer for this question, since you can't back anything up with a fact. \nI feel that the Power mac G3 is the best Mac for Ubuntu, but I guess you don't. \nMy point is that you can't say that \"this is better to buy than that\", since older models are more likely to have been implemented in Ubuntu. Here's a list of the macs you wanted to buy and the operating systems supported. \n\n\n*\n\n*Macbook Pro\n\n*Macbook Air\n\n*iMac\nSince you have not stated what version of the Macs you want to buy (new or old) I have to give you the general links. \n\nA: I use My Mack Book Pro 6.2 and It works quite well. Apple does some weird things, but a MBP works quite well. Be aware that when new hardware is released it takes a while to get the changes into the kernel. I know the latest MBAs have a couple of problems and the Retina has a few minor issues. \nThis page really helps\nI still recommend the MBP, but that may be bias. \n\nA: I would probably recommend a MacBook air (or possibly a Mini, but I don't have any experience there).\nIn my experience, any Ubuntu on Apple hardware setup is going to require some configuration to really get it working ideally, but avoiding the very latest hardware and the hardware with multiple graphics chipsets will eliminate quite a few headaches.\nThe other \"gotcha\" you're likely to run into is so much incorrect and conflicting advice on how to boot the system, in regards to EFI vs BIOS compatibility mode (a similar thing is happening right now in PC advice with UEFI entering the market). Once you get your Mac, highly recommend reading the documentation on the Refind EFI boot manager, which should help quite a bit in getting you started with a native EFI boot.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 NVIDIA card overscan on HDMI HDTV I have a GT 430 Nvidia, was working fine till I upgraded to 12.04 yesterday.

I managed to break my installation of Ubuntu.

I believe this will include the grub-* programs or update-grub2.\n\nI've tried booting from my Live CD, and tried burning a new one just in case it was corrupted but I still arrive back at the grub rescue> prompt.\n\nThe fact that your Live CD boot does not work implies your BIOS settings are set to check your HDD before your CD/DVD drive.  I would enter your BIOS and check the \"Boot Priority\", typically found on the Boot Tab.\nAlso, many BIOSes I have seen, especially in the past few years, have a \"Boot Override\" selection in the Save & Exit Tab.  You could try to force the BIOS to boot from the Live CD using this method.\n"]
