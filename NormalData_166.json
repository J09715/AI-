["Q: PDF- corrupt file Today I went to somebody with a PDF file, I've made it with LibreOffice Writer, but, when he tried to open the file, it said that it was a corrupt file, my PDF. \nI've put the file on my usb stick, and from there he opened it.\nWhat can I do to open that file on that pc? I have to say that other files (PDF) can be opened on that pc. My file can't be corrupt because some of my friends can open it.\nThank you.\n\nA: His PDF reader could be old, and not able to read up to date formats. However, you could create a PDF in a different way, by opening the LibreOffice Writer file, select Print, and Print to a PDF. \n", "Q: Will Ubuntu 13.10 work fine on my netbook?? or should i choose some previos version?

So this will not be supported. The ~/Ubuntu One/ folder will always be synchronized. You can, however, achieve such a usage, by creating another synchronized folder on the server with the REST API, uploading files directly to the server with the REST API, and simply never choosing to synchronize that folder on the client side (or possibly, not even use the client on a machine where you want this behavior).\nI don't know of any existing scripts or programs to simply do that, but you are certainly free to write one. Such a script could be integrated with the Send to… feature in Nautilus. The duplicity plug-in for Deja Dup, does do this, for uploading back-up files to Ubuntu One, as an example.\n", "Q: How to tell Ubuntu to remember I have a UK keyboard? I'm running 12.04 and have been since April 2012! All was well, then at some point in the last few weeks I've noticed that Ubuntu seems to think my keyboard has gone American. It hasn't. It hasn't changed at all, neither has anything else*. But now I type quotes @like this@ and don't even ask about my \\hashtags\nIf I go to keyboard layout, everything is set to UK, just as I'd expect. Although there is a blank space by \"Input source\" on the \"System\" tab. But it's clearly NOT treating the keyboard as UK.\n*the only thing I have changed is to enable auto-login for this user. Surely that should not affect it?\n\n\n\n\nA: I consider this a bug, but by adding a US keyboard below the UK one in the Layouts tab of the Keyboard Layout settings window, I can now say \"problem solved\" #ftw.\n\nAlthough now I have an annoying \"en1\" item in the top right menu bar of Gnome Shell.\n", "Q: Running software-center from command line as root I'm not using Unity, so I don't have a handy button to click on to start software-center. It's occasionally useful to search for software, though, so I run it from the command line. However, then I can't actually install the software through that interface (no permissions). So I tried sudo software-center instead, hoping to fix that. After entering my password on the command line, I'm presented with a dialog box asking for:\n\nEnter password for keyring 'default' to unlock\n\nWhat should I enter here to get software-center to actually start up as root?\nHere's some more information. I'm running Enlightenment (E17) as my desktop environment. The buttons that appear on the side bar in unity don't appear to have an equivalent in E17, which is why i'm running software-center from the command line. When i do so, as me instead of root, at the point where i try to install something, an error message pops up that says:\nAuthentication Error. Software can't be installed or removed because the authentication service is not available. (org.freedesktop.PolicyKit.Error.Failed: ('system-bus-name', {'name': ':1.96'}): org.debian.apt.install-or-remove-packages\n\nPolicykit does not appear to be running, or at least nothing resembling that name shows up with \"ps wux\". So i guess that raises the question, would anyone know how to get that to start up automatically when i log in?\nThanks!\n\nA: You shouldn't be running software-center as root. You should simply launch it as your own user. Installing a package should prompt you with a policykit dialog box asking for your password. Is that not happening?\n\nA: You need pkexec instead:\npkexec software-center\n\nThat way is like you were starting it from the GUI.\n\nA: A good option is to use the following two commands:\nsudo -i           #login as root\nsoftware-center   #run software-center as root\n\nIf you want to use pkexec software-center as @Braiam suggested in his answer you will most likely get some errors and the command leads to a core dump (as @gunbert said in this comment). The right way to run software-center as root using pkexec is:\npkexec env DISPLAY=$DISPLAY XAUTHORITY=$XAUTHORITY software-center\n\nAnd this is normal because man pkexec is very clear in this sense:\n\n       [...] pkexec will not allow you to run X11 applications\n       as another user since the $DISPLAY and $XAUTHORITY environment\n       variables are not set.[...]\n\n\nAlso, see Why should users never use normal sudo to start graphical applications?\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 x64, hybrid graphics card, can not resume after suspend I'm using Ubuntu 13.10 x64, my hybrid graphics card is Intel HD Graphics 4600 and Nvidia Geforce 740m.\nI installed Nvidia driver follow this article.

If you don´t know how to open the laptop and check if the SATA cable is connected take it to a shop, if it is the hard drive I recommend the new drive you buy is an SSD, you will never have that problem again as it doesnt have mechanical parts(and you will fly loading OS and apps), hope it solves your issue.\n\nA: 1) Boot from the Live CD\n2) Insert a USB FlashDrive and when it is recognized copy the contents of your/dev/sda/home directory (assuming your hard drive is /dev/sda) and all subdirectories beneath it to the flashdrive.\n3) From a terminal window, run sudo fdisk /dev/sda (assuming your hard drive is /dev/sda) and from its menu, delete the partitions\n4) Reinstall from your LiveCD\n5) Once reinstall is complete, then copy your old /home files back onto the hard drive\n6) Take ownership with sudo find /home -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \\; also from a terminal window  \n\nA: try:\nsudo fdisk /dev/sda\nit should display something like this:\n/dev/sda1   *        2048   201328639   100663296   83  Linux\n/dev/sda2       201330686   209713151     4191233    5  Extended\n/dev/sda5       201330688   209713151     4191232   82  Linux swap / Solaris\nCommand (m for help):\ntry the 'd'.

When I use juju bootstrap it installs 12.04 release to the nodes. \nWhy is this happening. Can you give me some advices?\n\nA: Your default-series environment config setting defaults to precise, because almost all the charms in the store are written for precise, and so juju is picking charms for precise and deploying them to precise.\nIf you want to deploy to saucy, you should change your environments.yaml file:\nenvironments:\n    myenv:\n        type: maas\n        default-series: saucy\n        ...\n\n...but you'll need to make sure you have charms that run on saucy, so you'll almost certainly need to write them yourself (or maybe try copying the existing ones for precise?) and deploy them from a local repository.\n", "Q: I have ubuntu 12.04 LTS with a dual boot of Windows 7, Can I reinstall Windows 7, without changing partitions? I initially had Windows 7 as my primary operating system. I decided to install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS as a dual boot. However, I realized that my Windows 7 OS wasn't installed properly (not because of Ubuntu). I already created partition sizes for both OS's. Is it possible to reinstall Windows 7 without having to chnage around my Ubuntu setup? \nThanks\n\nA: Yes, Windows 7 will let you choose a partition to install itself into during the installation procedure. Simply choose your current Windows partition.\nHowever, the Windows installation procedure will overwrite your MBR where grub is installed. This means that you will not be able to boot into your Linux system after the Windows installation; your PC will always boot Windows. Don't worry, though. Your Linux is still there, you're simply missing the option to boot it. All you will have to do at that point is use an Ubuntu Live CD or USB, and reinstall grub using a tool such as BootRepair. This will enable you to dual-boot again.\nSee here for instructions on how to repair your dual-boot functionality using an Ubuntu Live system.\n", "Q: Sound from bluetooth speaker seems to freeze often and is out of sync with the video Computer Model: Dell Inspiron N5050 (laptop).\nVersion of Ubuntu: Have checked in Ubuntu 13.10 and 13.04\nModel of Bluetooth speaker: Bose Soundlink mini bluetooth speaker\nDescription of issue: \nIssue 1: Able to pair and connect laptop to the speaker (but the connection breaks after some time and I have to remove the speaker from the laptop bluetooth and repair and reconnect).\nIssue 2: When the speaker is connected; if I play a movie, the sound often stops (and pauses the video).

Negative values of X mean that the image will be delayed, and positive values mean the sound will be delayed.\n\nA: You should try a current release or another Bluetooth dongle.

I made a directory called cipher, moved the two files into it and tried the ./configure command again.  The system couldn't find configure.\nCan anyone help me, please?\n\nA: The IDEA patent expired world-wide some time ago. The easiest solution would be to upgrade to GnuPG 1.4.13 (or newer) containing the algorithm by default. Saucy is the first Ubuntu release to include this version.\n\nIf you can't:\nThe GnuPG website asks you to read to file headers, which explain how to build it:\n/*\n * [snip]\n * To build a GnuPG with IDEA support, copy this file into the cipher/\n * directory of the gnupg distribution, and ./configure and make as\n * usual.  IDEA will be built directly in to the GnuPG binary.  This\n * is the recommended way to use this file.\n */\n\nThis means, you have to build GnuPG completely by yourself instead of using the repository package. Download and unpack the sources, and you will find a cipher directory. Put the file into there, and then continue with building GnuPG like described in the manual.\nOr alternatively:\n/*\n * If you are not building IDEA directly into GnuPG, and need to build\n * the dynamically loadable IDEA module, compile with:\n       gcc -Wall -O2 -shared -fPIC -o idea idea.c\n * [snip]\n */\n\nThis means, you're not linking the IDEA algorithm into GnuPG, but build it as a dynamic module (in Windows, you'd compare it with some .dll file). What the file header's aren't revealing is how this library will be loaded. Put the compiled binary into some place (for example ~/.gnupg/idea) and add this line to your ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf file:\nload-extension ~/.gnupg/idea\n\nThis will only offer IDEA in gpg (not gpg2)!\n", "Q: Downgrade gnome 3.10 to gnome 3.8?

Why we need Mono on Linux?\n\nA: C# and all the other languages belonging to the .NET framework are interpreted languages. They are pseudo-compiled, not truly compiled (like C). The bytecode of the .NET framework is called Common Intermediate Language (CIL).\nThe interpreter (sometimes known as \"virtual machine\") for the Common Intermediate Language is the .NET Common Language Runtime on Windows and Mono on Linux. Therefore, C# applications won't run \"native\" (i.e. without an interpreter), not even on Windows.\nProbably what surprises you is that Mono is not installed by default on some Linux distributions, while the .NET runtime is.\nAnyhow, you can write applications in C# that are nicely integrated with Ubuntu. An example is Tomboy.\nThere's also an another language, similar to C#, developed by the GNOME project, which is Vala. Vala is translated into C, which is itself compiled, so it will run \"native\". Because Vala was built by GNOME developers for GNOME developers, it is extremely easy to integrate with the GNOME desktop environment.\n\nA: To develop for Ubuntu use the QML SDK:\nGet the SDK | Ubuntu Developer\n", "Q: High-level library for Unity Dash? I've wanted to write a GTK+ version of Unity Dash for some time. I think it could be useful for Xfce, Gnome Flashback, elementaryOS, etc. \nBefore I start doing anything about it, I'd like to know if there are any high-level libraries to search Scopes, use filters, etc. A GIR-lib would be very nice. \nDoes anything like this exist, or am I going to have to do all the dbus stuff myself? \n\nA: Gambas3 has an option to install UnitySC which lets you fill out a form and create items which will appear in Unity Dash. The unity plugin, doesnt create an application interface, but you can do that with gambas. Instead, you run UnitySC and fill the form accordingly, to get a link to the item in dash, and Icons, comments, etc. \n\nSo, when I compiled Gambas3, It did not make an Icon for gambas3 in the Dasah menu. Ah, but I can fix that right now!\nhere using the UnitySC tool, I added gambas3 to the dash menu, and to the unity bar, with the Icon I screen captured from the gambas website.\n\n\n", "Q: add-apt-repository ppa: gives me errors I'm new to Ubuntu (12.04.3).

I'm using juju 1.16.3 and I am attempting to use juju add-machine to get a MaaS node ready for a service deployment. I want to get Ubuntu installed and ready so service deployment takes less time. The machine is started and the OS installed, and the agent-state is \"started\". However, when I deploy a service, it decideds to start a new machine anyway and ignores the one already started.\nWhen I deploy the service without doing add-machine beforehand, then a new machine is automatically allocated from MaaS and the service deploys to it just fine. The ONLY difference is that when I do juju add-machine prior to deploying the service, it won't deploy to that machine.\nAm I misunderstanding the purpose of add-machine? If so, what is the proper method for preparing a machine with a base OS prior to service deployment?\n\nA: If you're using constraints at all, I think you've hit a consequence of this bug -- none of the existing machines will be matched.\nYou can work around it with the --to parameter to deploy or add-unit:\n$ juju deploy mysql --to 3\n$ juju add-unit mysql --to 4\n\n", "Q: Is there a ubuntu multudimenesional desktop tool?

I am running the latest ubuntu but It is hard to get the curser to move a browser windows out of the way. I am using the arcvamarin theme I think\n\nA: Firstly such a theme does not exist - i cannot check if it's actually a theme related issue. Theme's name may be misspelled (check it). \nSecondly - specify your problem more precisely - do you mean minimizing the browser (firefox, I suppose) window? If yes and it actually IS theme related problem - why wouldn't you simply change your theme? Otherwise you can always try Ctrl+Alt+0 shortcut (or customize it to anything you want in Ubuntu settings). The 0 key is from numpad on default.\nIf by \"moving browser windows out of the way\" you mean just moving the unmaximized window around your desktop - you can either also use similar shortcuts but with 1,2,3... instead of 0, or install software like CompizConfig Settings Manager (look for it in Ubuntu Software Center). It enables you to customize the way you interact with windows, for instance with alt button held you can move your window around by simply clicking (anywhere inside the window) and dragging it around.\nAnother way to install Compiz - paste that into the terminal window:\nsudo apt-get install compiz compizconfig-settings-manager compiz-fusion-plugins-extra compiz-fusion-plugins-main compiz-plugins\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.04: Can't login using Ubuntu(Default) session.

It seems like such a simple questions but I cant find any resource regarding it\nIn C/C++ , it means to store the read in a value from command prompt and store it inside a variable , \nHow about in Shell Programming?\n\nA: The > and >> are redirection operators for FD's (File Descriptors)\nIn bash you have tree standard FD's that are the standard input (strin), the standard output (strout) and the standard error (strerr). These can also be called by FD 0, FD 1 and FD 2 respectively.\nNormally you would have you would have all FD's pointing to the terminal, but this can be changed by using redirection.\nFor example, if you call:\ncommand > log.txt\n\nYou will redirect the output to the file log.txt\nThis is similar as calling:\ncommand 1> log.txt\n\nAs this only redirects strout you will still be able to see the error in the terminal.\nIn order to redirect strerr to you log.txt file you will have to run:\ncommand 2> log.txt\n\nAgain, this only redirects strerr. If you wish to redirect both stdout and stderr you need to duplicate your stderr output to stdout by using the >& command.\ncommand 1> log.txt 2>&1\n\nTo understand this command you need to read it form right to left, first a copy of stderr is made to stdout, then strout is redirected to the log.txt file.\nWhen you use redirection in this way, bash will not look if the file exists or not and simply create one regardless if that implies erasing the existing one. If you want to avoid loosing what has already been written in your log file you can then use the >> command in the same ways explained above, but in this case all the outputs will be appended to existing files.\nFor their use in C++ with cin, cout and cerr I think hash gave a better answer than I could.\nI'm not an expert in these so I might have gotten some things wrong.

If the file specified does not already exist, it is created; if it does exist, it is overwritten. The left angle bracket symbol (<) is used to redirect input from a disk file. To append output to an existing file, use double right angle brackets (>>)\n\nA: In shell script the > operator will create a file that you will put just right to it and will erase every content of the file if exist \nbut the >> will append the text to the file that will be right to it\npreferable >> will use in writing log file. like You want to add time,count or some process logs\nand > to create new file try this out:\n  #!/bin/bash\n  nowt=$(date +\"%T\")\n  date1=$(date +\"%s\")\n  NOW=$(date +\"%d-%m-%Y\")\n  now=$NOW\" \"$nowt\n  file_name=$NOW\"_\"$nowt\".log\"\n  echo \"START TIME WAS :$now \" | cat > /home/user/Desktop/$file_name\n  sh some_sh_file you want to run  2>&1 | tee >> /home/user/Desktop/$file_name #want to log the out put\n  nowt=$(date +\"%T\")\n  date2=$(date +\"%s\")\n  NOW=$(date +\"%d-%m-%Y\")\n  now=$NOW\" \"$NOW\n  diff=$(($date2-$date1))\n  echo \"$(($diff / 60)) minutes and $(($diff % 60)) seconds elapsed.\"\n  echo \"END TIME WAS :$now\" | cat >> /home/user/Desktop/$file_name\n  echo \"$(($diff / 60)) minutes and $(($diff % 60)) seconds elapsed.\" | cat >> /home/user/Desktop/$file_name  \n\n", "Q: Installation for dummies I would like to use Ubuntu on a virtual machine so that I can run an open source engineering software called OpenFoam. \nI need instructions for a layperson.

Thus, they can contain new features, but may also break\ncompatibility with their older version. However, they are compiled\nspecifically for your version of Ubuntu.

If it was corrupted, you could get what you report.\nShould that prove to match, then I would extract just a portion at a time with an archive manager, which works for me.

I recently made a driver change and now when I boot all I get is a black screen. I want to reinstall Ubuntu 12.04 LTS without losing all of my data and files in my /home folder. How can I create a backup of my /home folder without access to my desktop? Note: I am able to access the GRUB menu but I don't know where to go from there.\n\nA: As long as your stuff isn't encrypted, use either hirens boot cd and load mini xp, or use your install cd and click on \"Try Ubuntu without installing\". Then open up the file explorer and copy your stuff to another partition, another hard drive you have, or a usb flash drive. Re-install Ubuntu, and don't make a dangerous driver change ever again.\n\nA: You can use the \"Use Ubuntu Without Installing\" from a USB drive or CD.\nOnce it boots use the File manager to backup your home directory into a different drive/External drive.\nThen, install from the CD/USB, in all eventuality, the installer should detect an existing installation and prompt to \"Upgrade\" or \"reinstall\", you may even retain the folders depending on the options you choose.\n", "Q: Is it safe to disable the guest account in 12.04 LTS Tech info: OS:Ubuntu 12.04 LTS , Memory: 993.1 Mib Processer intel (r) CPU T2050 (Dual Core) @ 1.6 GHZ (1600Mhz), Os:32 bit.... im using an HP Pavillion DV5220us\nis it safe to disable the guest account on ubuntu using the following method:\nBy default ubuntu 12.04 comes with guest account.You can disable this account using the following procedure.Guest account is a paswordless account which allow users to get access to Ubuntu machine\nOpen /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf file from your terminal using the following command\ngksudo gedit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf\n\nAdd the following line\nallow-guest=false\n\nSave and exit the file\nAfter adding the above line you should see similar to the following in lightdm.conf file\n[SeatDefaults]\nuser-session=ubuntu\ngreeter-session=unity-greeter\nallow-guest=false\n\nFinally you have to restart lightdm using the following command from your terminal\nsudo restart lightdm\n\n\nA: AFAIK, Yes. \nI can't think of any side-affects possible, just the gained security of not having guest access to your system. Granted, I'm a bit of a noob when it comes to internal matters of the system like this, but it would make sense that it wouldn't.\n\nA: The guest account is just with minimal permissions and be sure its safe to keep.\nThere is no security issues from keeping guest account..

The root web directory should always be accessible by Apache and me (I login to ftp with my account) as well (if possible) by my CGI applications. I would like to hear your ideas of the best way to set something up like this in production.\nMaybe what I've suggested isn't the best way to set this up even. If there's a better way to set things up for production (I plan to be using CGI scripts and compiled CGI binaries)\n\nA: You will want to create a group and add all of the accounts to it that will need to access your web root directory. Once this is done then you will need to change the group for the folder and its contents. \nYou will definitely want to add the account that Apache is running under (usually apache) to the group as well as the account that will be executing the CGI scripts. If I recall correctly your ftp server will be accessing files as the account it is running as rather than the log in you are using when you access it.    \nTo create the group you can use the following: \n$sudo groupadd newgroup\n\nTo add users to the group use the following for each user:\n$sudo usermod -a -G newgroup username\nTo change the group that the webroot folder belongs to: \n$sudo chown -R currentowner:newgroup yourwebrootfolder\n\n", "Q: How can i install SPE(Stani's Python Editor) for python3.3 I have ubuntu 13.10.I have SPE which runs for python2.7.4+.But i need to run it for python 3.3.2+.How can i do it.My system uses python2.7.4+ by default.\n\nA: Stani's Python editor package in Ubuntu repos depends on Python 2.*\nYou will not be able to run in on Python 3.\nIf you install the spe package it will automatically install all necessary packages including python 2.*\n", "Q: Problem installing HP Wireless Printer I have an HP5510 Wireless printer that I have been using for a year or two.\nI have no problems connecting to it with both my current laptop running 12.04LTS and my wife's Windows 8 HP laptop.  I recently installed Ubuntu 13.10 as a dual boot on my wife's HP with minimal hassle.  However, I simply cannot get this bloody printer to work with 13.10!\nI have tried simply adding the printer through the Printers section of Ubuntu.  It is unable to find the printer when it scans.  When I manually enter the IP address of the printer it then finds the printer and recognizes it as an HP5510-d series printer.  I click ADD and it goes to the next screen where it starts to install, pauses for roughly three seconds, and then pops up a dialogue saying \"Unable to install printer\" with no further explanation.\nI've done this maybe a dozen times with the same result.  I downloaded and installed the current hplip, but that did not help at all.  I even downloaded and installed the HpLip GUI tool.  Using that tool I try to add a wireless printer but it insists that I first cable to the printer.  Nope.  I've had this printer for quite some time.  I'm sure it came with a cable but... nope.  And why would I need a USB cable to connect to a printer that is already online!  Isn't that just for initializing the printer?!?!?\nAnyway, I appear to be stuck.  Any suggestions that don't involve purchasing a USB cable simply to connect to Ubuntu for 90 seconds in order to install a printer that it is able to connect with wirelessly when I give it the IP address?  I've spent years telling my wife how much easier everything is in Ubuntu as opposed to Windows, and right now this is killing my credibility.\n\nA: For scan to work on some HP printers you need to install the some special driver provided by HP - which I can remember the name of right now.\nThis is easily done by running the following in the terminal\nsudo hp-setup\n\nIf the printer is on a personal network then choose the 2nd option so that a USB cable is not needed.\n\nA: hplip is the setup software for HP printers and scanners. hplip toolbox is the GUI.\nBoth are in the repos.\n", "Q: I have 2 versions of Adobe Reader I once installed Reader from the Adobe website.

I have tried searching for it in the Software Center but didn't find it there. Thankfully PDF documents open with the new version but when I search the program in the launcher, I see 2 exact icons of Reader.\n\nA: Reinstall the version of the old reader via sudo command in the terminal or thru the browser if that's how you got it. Once you install it you need should go thru the software centre and uninstall it from there and if that doesn't work then try sudo .... You could also just change the name of the application I'm assuming by its .jason or json file ?? I know that works via windows and or you could find the package in your system folder and try to do it from there however I would use the first two and I strongly thing the last shouldn't be used becuase it may cause instability on the system if you remove bits an peice instead of chunks ... Have you checked to make sure the package name is correct if you have two of the same application I wouldn't think they could run at the same time using the same package name. Also just thought of it : have you tried removing both thru the software centre ??? Try removing the new and then the old or via versa .. \nA wild guess also check your system for viruses some are cross platform and adobe reader would be a good way to sneak in a virus.....  And yes I know you said that you had downloaded it from there website but maybe it was a very good phishing version???

(because I had a problem with 331 previously)\n\n*Then I run a program which need 3D support, in this case a Steam game, but Steam detected there is a newer version of nvidia and ask me to update it, so I close Steam, go back to the 'Additional Drivers', choose the 331 version and activate it, then restart my laptop, and the pixelated screen is still gone~~ (double yay~!!)\nIn the process of trial and error, maybe I've missed out some step or done something wrong and I met some problems such as low graphic mode, looping in login screen. If you meet one of them, or maybe both...\nTo solve low graphics mode:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot into Recovery mode again.\n\n*Choose 'Boot Normally' when a menu appear.\n\n*Open up terminal by hitting Ctrl+Alt+T.\n\n*Remove all nvidia package by typing:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge nvidia*\n\n\n*Install the more stable/tested version:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\n\n*Install the more up-to-date version:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates\n\n\n*Reboot.\nTo solve the looping in Login screen:\n\n\n*\n\n*At the login screen, press Crtl+Alt+F1 to boot into shell environment.\n\n*Type your username and password to login.\n\n*Change the working directory to your home directory:\ncd ~\n\n\n*Rename a hidden file:\nsudo mv .Xauthority .XauthorityBak\n\n\n*Reboot.\nThis should fix the problem, but if you started to get a 'System Problem Detected' when you would login from a locked desktop, try to change the .Xauthority ownership in your home directory by typing the following command in terminal:\nsudo chown $USER: .Xauthority\n\n\nA: I have faced similar issues, but this was when I installed the proprietary video driver for my graphics card. \nI think this happens when Ubuntu initialises the graphics driver for the first time. \nFor me, it was pretty much harmless, as in, it doesn't cause any difference to the working of the computer. I ignored it due to this reasoning. \nIf it causes any problem in the working of Ubuntu after it boots up, then it should be a cause of concern. Until then, no issues. \n", "Q: Steam runs but needs libgl1-mesa-dri:i386, and libgl1-mesa-glx:i386 I have just installed Steam on my 64-bit Ubuntu 13.10 and it works well and I can play games, but each time I launch it I get the following prompt:\nSteam needs to install these additional packages: \n    libgl1-mesa-dri:i386, libgl1-mesa-glx:i386\n[sudo] password for user: \n............................................................................................................................................\nReading package lists...

If the problem does not return, then change to the 16GB configuration. If the problem then returns, your memory is defective.\n\nA: You can use a program like MemTest86+ to test your memory. I always run the test overnight whenever i do an installation/upgrade of memory. This will let you know if you got some bad RAM.\nHere is a link to the MemTest+ website: http://www.memtest.org/\nIf you get any errors at all then you know you have something wrong with your RAM. You can then pull the new sticks you installed for the upgrade and run the test again to make sure that you are not getting the errors from the old memory. \n\nA: An easier way to test memory is to hold [shift] on startup.

I have two machine, host1 and host2.\nI would like to use an environment variable of host2, from a scp command from host1. For instance, use this kind of command from host1 :\nscp file host2@host2_adress:$FOO\n\nwhere $FOO is defined in host2 as the path of a directory. If I am using the command above, bash will search among the variables of host1 and not host2.\nA practical example would be to use the $HOME variable of host2\nHow to do it ?\n\nA: You may try something like this:\nscp file host2@host2_address:$(ssh host2@host2_address 'printf $FOO')\n\nIn order to resolve the value of the variable $(ssh host2@host2_address 'printf $FOO'), the shell will internally execute the command ssh host2@host2_address 'printf $FOO', and take whatever this command prints as the value of the variable, which is then substituted into the outer scp command. It is, of course, clear that you have to fetch the variable $FOO from host2, because host1 simply does not know it. One way to fetch it is using ssh as in the above command.\nMind:\n\n\n*\n\n*You have to have some kind of public-key authentication working, so that the inner ssh command works without any further user input. Otherwise, because of the inner ssh and the outer scp, you would be prompted for the password twice.\n\n*You should ensure that the inner ssh command prints out nothing but the variable $FOO. Try it out on its own before using it in the outer scp command and make sure it works.\n\n*For some reason I do not fully understand, when I tested the command that I wrote above, it would not work as expected because the fetched variable would contain some weird control prefix. For instance, when I tried to copy something to the remote $HOME, it would try yo copy it to \\033k$HOME\\033\\\\/home/user instead of simply /home/user. I had to use the following to get it to work:\nscp file host2@host2_address:$(ssh host2@host2_address 'printf $FOO' | cut -d\\\\ -f2)\n\n...where $FOO was $HOME in my particular case, of course.\nThis is a quick (as it's rather short) and dynamic (as it will fetch the variable on the fly) solution I came up with. However, particularly because of the last point, I think it would be more reliable to have a script that fetches the remote variables by first printing them to a file. More precisely, that script on host1 would connect to host2, remotely print the output of printenv to some file at host2, fetch that file from host2, parse it, and export the values to local environment variables. For example, the variable $FOO on host2 could be put into a variable $HOST2_FOO on host1. The following script would do this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nssh host2@host2_address  'printenv > host2_vars.txt'\nscp host2@host2_address:host2_vars.txt .\n#ssh host2@host2_address  'rm host2_vars.txt' #if you like to clean up\neval $(cat host2_vars.txt | perl -pe 's/^(.*)=(.*)$/export HOST2_$1=\"$2\"/g')\n\nOf course, you would have to execute that script before the scp command.\n\nA: I'd suggest escaping the dollar\nscp file host2@host2_adress:\"\\$FOO\"\n\n", "Q: Recording a Screencast in XMonad I have been trying to record a screencast under xmonad, the problem is that it seems that both vokoscreen and record my desktop go a bit haywire when I try to tell them to record one window under xmonad. \nDoes anyone have any advice on how to get this to work?\n\nA: Have you tried SimpleScreenRecorder.

So as per the above two methods which is the actual boot time?\n\nA: The first command, last reboot, does not tell you the boot time. It tells you at what times your system was running. For example, the first entry tells you that your system has been running from 14:55 to 16:35 on Wed 8. That's 1 hour and 39 minutes. It did not take your system 1 hour and 39 minutes to boot - hopefully ;)\nThe second command, dmesg, brings you closer to what you want to know, but since dmesg will continually output more system events while your system is running, it's not the tool of choice to measure boot time either.\nIf you really want to reliably measure your system boot time, I would recommend a tool such as bootchart.\nSee here:\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/BootCharting\n\nA: I don't know what the values mean, if you want faster loading times update to Ubuntu 13.10, you will see a nice speedup on your machine and all your apps updated to the latest stable versions.\nRemember to run in the terminal:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\n(this erases packages you don't need)\nYou can also speed up your system by:\nsudo apt-get install bleachbit\n\nand then\nsudo bleachbit\n\nThis program will delete many unused temporary files, you will also see a nice boost on the loading times, please try it and post the new results so that we can all know the real speedup.

Usually 127.0.1.1 is the IP that resolves your computer hostname.\nIf you remove that line slave1-machine won't be able to resolve. (Its not a big problem. Some times it will throw an error saying hostname can't be resolved.)\n", "Q: Mysql/php connection I'm a newbie to ubuntu,and  im trying to connect the mysqlworkbench(database) with php5.3\nif (function_exists('mysql_connect')) {\n echo \"Good<br />\\n\";\n} else {\necho \"Bad.<br />\\n\";\n}\n\nI'm getting the output as Bad and then i tried with mysqli_connect ,that is also not exists in my scenario.

With USB also its not booting after disabling secure boot, fast boot.\nSo any one installed dual boot win8 & ubuntu on Asus F202E-CT148H, Plz help. ?\n\nA: You must first disable UEFI on your computer BIOS, once you have done that Windows will still be able to start. You will then enter boot options and set to boot from the USB you have created of the Ubuntu 13.10 64 bit iso (you can use Universal USB installer on Windows to do this) and you will then be able to install it.\nPS: You can also from Windows mount the iso you have downloaded by double clicking on it and install Wubi.exe that will install Ubuntu inside your Windows partition :)\n", "Q: named.conf or named.conf.local First time installing BIND, the server will be a primary server with several zones which another server hosted elsewhere will slaves from.\nWe are currently running Solaris BIND and it uses the named.conf file but Ubuntu docs say to use named.conf.local for primary servers. Is this correct and if possible can someone explain the difference in the two files?\nmany thanks\n\nA: named.conf - contains main configuration file for the DNS file. \nnamed.conf.local - contains the local DNS server configuration, and this is where you declare the zones associated with the domain. \nnamed.conf.local is basically included in named.conf (last line from named.conf):\ninclude \"/etc/bind/named.conf.local\";\n\nreference:\nhttps://wiki.debian.org/Bind9\n", "Q: remove swap to create another backup partition I need windows :(, i use Dual Boot.\nI have a space that is not used in HD for having execido on [humerus of the win8 discs.

I have 8 Gb of memory, my swap partition is 16 gb.\n\nA: Open the file /etc/fstab like this:\ngksu gedit /etc/fstab\n\nAnd find the line referring to your swap partition. In my case is:\n/dev/sdb1 none swap sw 0 0\n\nAnd I've commented it to look like this:\n#/dev/sdb1 none swap sw 0 0\n\nAfter that, reboot your computer and check for a few minutes/hours of normal usage. If it works OK, you can now use gparted to format that swap partition as you like. If you want to use it for windows, I recomend FAT32 or NTFS format.\nIf you have problems, just revert to the previous state by un-comenting the swap line (that's removing the \"#\" symbol). And, of course, reformating the partition to swap format.\n\nA: If you sure enough you will not lack of memory then you can delete your swap.but 16 GB for windows installation is little bit to tight for Windows itself\n\nA: Yes you can be able to delete your 16 GB swap partition to create a backup partition.\nAll you have to do is,open gparted and then right-click on the swap partition to select swap-off option.After selecting the swap-off option,you can be able to delete that partition.\nAfter that create ntfs partition from the deleted partition.\n", "Q: No wakeup after screenlock After 10 minutes my desktop computer darkens the screen, and when I move the mouse or tab any key it comes back alive and asks for my password.

Normal people say: \"they sound very bad\".\nFirst-step solution: equalization\nEqualizing provides a valuable workaround, dramatically improving sound quality with a one-time effort. For example, I installed PulseAudio Equalizer from Web Upd8.\nFor good results, equalization values should be chosen based on measurements, but that's another story (I could do it with Ubuntu alone though it's tricky, ask me for details).\nRemaining problem: equalization curve is output-dependent\nEqualization values are attached to the whole chain, though generally only the speakers are a major source of unequal response. \nThis means I have two equalization profiles:\n\n\n*\n\n*one for laptop speakers (with wildly varying equalization curve)\n\n*another (much flatter curve, so disabling equalization is often acceptable) when an external stereo is plugged to e.g. a 3.5mm jack.\n\n\nCurrent situation in practice: auto un/mute, good but insufficient\n\n\n*\n\n*When plugging the 3.5mm jack to the external stereo, internal speakers are automatically muted and volume adjusted by the Ubuntu stack. This is good but insufficient.\n\n*When unplugging, internal speakers are automatically activated again. This is good but insufficient.\n\n\nImprovement: not only auto-mute but auto-select eq curve\nIt would be much better to have the correct equalizer preset applied when un/plugging the 3.5mm jack. Plug the external stereo, the flat curve is selected. Unplug the stereo, internal speaker get their correction curve.\n\nQuestions\nHow to make a quick-and-dirty hack ? How to detect jack plug from a script ?\n\n\n*\n\n*Regarding detecting the plugging event. I could not find documentation on the web, plus the keyword \"jack\" returns results regarding the jack software suite, irrelevant here. Meager starting points: sound - How to automatically change volume level when un-/plugging headphones? - Ask Ubuntu Jack detection for audio : Blueprints : Ubuntu\n\n*Regarding changing the equalizer curve I could not find any documentation about pulseaudio-equalizer-gtk. A proof-of-concept script fiddling with files then calling pulseaudio-equalizer interface.applysettings could change the settings, but the GUI wouldn't be aware.\nHow to make a clean setup: assign the equalization curve to internal speaker, not just plug event.\nFor example, say I plug a USB audio device and play audio through it. The quick-and-dirty hack would change EQ curve whenever the 3.5mm jack is un/plugged, though the audio actually continued to go to the USB audio device not the internal speaker, making eq curve change irrelevant.\nIn a \"clean\" setup, an equalization profile would be cleanly assigned to the internal speaker, making the thing more robust. Whatever the situation, it would be always (and only) applied when needed.\nIs anyone working on it ? Any hint ?\nThank you for your attention.\n\nA: Because I have a similar problem i have made a \"quick and dirty\" python script which uses pulseaudio's DBus-Events to detect when to activate which equalizer profile.\nInstallation\nTo use it you have to add the following line to /etc/pulse/default.pa:\nload-module module-dbus-protocol\n\nThen disable the equalizer via pulseaudio-equalizer-gtk and click on \"Apply settings\", now close the GUI.\nDownload apply-equalizer.py save it somewhere and make it executable.\nExecute it as user (!). Maybe you need to install some additional python modules. Also you may want to automatically start it on login (i dont know what is the best way to do that).\nUsage\nThe script creates per-port [1] equalizer-configurations under ~/.config/apply-equalizer and symlinks them if a device changes the output port (i.e. headphones plugged in or out).\n[1]: many sound cards have different ports, e.g. one speaker-port and one headphone-port\nSo:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplug headphones.\n\n*Open pulseaudio-equalizer GUI\n\n*Customize equalizer-settings until it sounds good\n\n*\"Apply Settings\" will then assign the configuration you made (including if the equalizer is enabled at all) to the current port (speakers in this case)\n\n*close the GUI and repeat from step 2 for every port you want to assign (headphones not plugged in)\n\n\nNow the equalizer settings get automatically adjusted whenever your switch between speakers and headphones.\n\nA: Here a manual solution to switch between Equalizor ON (with your favorite settings) and OFF:\nif [ \"$(pulseaudio-equalizer status | grep \"Equalizer status\" | cut -d\"[\" -f2 | cut -d\"]\" -f1)\" == \"enabled\" ]; then\n    pulseaudio-equalizer disable\nelse\n    pulseaudio-equalizer enable\nfi\n\nSave as a file as a bash script, create a new panel starter to by able to start the script directly from desktop or your menu panel.\n", "Q: Rerun missing command with apt-get When I run a command on a new machine (or install that I'm testing) I often find that the package needs to be installed first.

I started from the following article to set up SFTP on Ubuntu Server: http://blog.srmklive.com/2013/04/24/how-to-setup-sftp-server-ftp-over-ssh-in-ubuntu/.  If I follow these instructions, I can connect with SFTP, but I am no longer able to connect to SSH from a terminal: \nThis service allows sftp connections only.\nConnection to 10.0.0.130 closed.\n\nHere are the changes I made to sshd_config:\nSubsystem sftp internal-sftp -f AUTH -1 VERBOSE\n\nAllowGroups sftpusers sftp sshusers\n\nMatch Group sftpusers\nChrootDirectory %h\nAllowTCPForwarding yes\nForceCommand internal-sftp\n\nX11Forwarding no\n\nThe user in question, jcoulson, is in both sftpusers and sshusers groups.\nAny hints?  Any further info you need?  Thanks!\n\nA: This setting\nMatch Group sftpusers\n...\nForceCommand internal-sftp\n\nrestricts access to sftp for the users in the group sftpusers. Either remove your user from the sftpusers group or remove that forcecommand option.\n\nA: You don't need to make any changes to the default installation of ssh to be able to use both sftp and ssh. All sftp is, is a means of doing file transfer over ssh.\n\nA: i've used a similar method with the same error and found out to use sshfs to connect/mount the sftp share on the server. Filezilla also connects but not able to get in with the terminal ssh command. http://www.fullybaked.co.uk/articles/chroot-ssh-ftp-users-to-home-directory was the tutorial i used to make it. I also had to create the home directory manually as the useradd command is not recommanded under ubuntu. \nsshfs user@server:/folder /home/user/folder-to-mount-in/ -p 22\n\nand to unmount\nfusermount -u /home/user/folder-to-mount-in/\n\nthat procedure with an automated script, rsa key authentication, cron and rsync helped me to plan automated backup.\n\nA: I solved a very a similar problem by considering it is exclusive : either you want to ssh or you want to sftp. Hence, removing my main user from the sftp group and leaving only my guests users as members of this sftp group, made ssh back again for my main user.\n", "Q: Can I safely change group ownership of /var/log/auth.log? I am the Splunk administrator working with an Ubuntu 12.04 LTS system and I want to collect events from /var/log/auth.log.  \n-rw-r----- 1 root adm 16534643 Jan  8 09:49 /var/log/auth.log\n\nSplunk runs as a normal user, splunk.\n$ id splunk\nuid=1984(splunk) gid=1984(splunk) groups=1984(splunk)\n\nNormally, I'd use this command so make the file group readable by the splunk group.\n$ chgrp splunk /var/log/auth.log\n-rw-r----- 1 root splunk 16534643 Jan  8 09:49 /var/log/auth.log\n\nThis works fine on other Linux distros and I assume this is okay with Ubuntu as well.  But I do want to ask, will bumping out the adm cause me (actually, the other group that owns the box) headaches in the future?  I am not a privileged user on the system, so I cannot check things like /var/log/cron/adm or mail for the adm account.  I'm also assuming that logrotate will honor my new group owner for new files.\n(Before you ask, access to the splunk index for auth.log is restricted to a limited number of people.)\n\nA: Followup:  Since no one ever gave a reason why \"adm\" group ownership was important, I changed the group ownership to \"splunk\".  \nAfter 6 months, no issues were noticed.  I decided against giving the splunk user additional group privileges by adding it to the \"adm\" group.  I reasoned I could give the adm account the extra privilege of \"splunk\" group membership, if necessary.\n\nA: adm group may be important IF a security tool such as AppArmor (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppArmor) is being used for additional security.\nI mention this only because I ran into strange problems (access failures) when trying to configure bind on ubuntu and using different directories. That is, bind refused to work with changes that made sense to me but were not the AppArmor defaults. As I did not want to reconfigure AppArmor I went back to it's defaults - and sudo su when I need to make changes. For a single user system this is okay, but I would not want it this way in a production system.\nLastly, adm group may be important if you are audited - i.e., an auditor may consider it a breach of system integrity if it is not group adm. A way you might be able to 'pass' with is using ACLs (Access Control Lists) - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions#ACL_.28Access_Control_List.29 for more info on that.\n", "Q: How can i automatically execute a script after automatic boot? I've recently opened a VPS running Ubuntu server 13.10 x86 (with no graphical desktop) in order to run a game server. Since it's a VPS there's a risk that the node may crash when I'm not watching. This means I may want to have the server execute this script automatically when the server boots. How can I do that? Another problem is that it seems to require a username and password after boot.\n\nA: To execute a script at startup of Ubuntu\n\n\n*\n\n*Edit /etc/rc.local and add your commands\n\n*The script must always end with exit 0\n\n\nMore information : Executing a script at startup and shutdown\n", "Q: Starting MAAS Region Controller service and API After a power outage our OpenStack installation went down. First step is trying to get MAAS back up and running, but I'm having trouble doing just that.

I am a KDE user thinking about moving to Unity. Due to manual disability, I use sticky keys and in KDE I have an applet in the system panel which shows which modifier keys are active. I remember that Gnome had this feature as well, so do Windows and OS X.\nHow does one ad the keyboard modifier state applet to the panel in Unity?\nClarification: I have already enabled sticky keys. I am asking how to add an applet which indicates the state of the modifier keys. This indicator would show when the Shift key is depressed, when the Alt key is depressed, when the Tux key is depressed, and when the Ctrl key is depressed. This applet exists in all major desktop environments (KDE, Windows, Mac OSX, and Gnome). It is necessary for accessibility of the desktop.\nHere is an image of the keyboard modifier state applet, next to the keyboard layout indicator applet. The modifiers represented are, from left to right, Shift, Ctrl, Alt, I-dont-know-this-one, Tux/Win, NumLock, and CapsLock. It can be seen that the NumLock key is active.\n\n\nA: This is an outstanding issue in Unity:\n\n\n*\n\n*lp#773078 Should display the StickyKeys status in some way (a11y)\n\n*lp#1306584 No keyboard state applet in Unity (Thanks to @dotancohen)\n\n\nThe code below has been updated, now it can use icons to show state. But it may get slow sometime as I has to update icon file on hard drive then reload it again. (See notes about this issue/limitation in libappindicator)\nA well packaged release was made available on webupd8 ppa (Thanks goes to Alin Andrei /Andrew/)\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install indicator-xkbmod\n\nReference: Keyboard Modifiers State indicator For Ubuntu: Xkbmod Indicator\n\nOriginal Answer:\nThis is not attended to be a canonical answer to the question.

Intel i3 2.2ghz x4 core, Windows 7 Home Premium (64bit), 4gb RAM, 600gb hd. Will happily provide more info if needed.\nI've successfully installed Ubuntu 12.04.3 alongside Windows 7 just to see how difficult it was (no problem at all). Display, audio, touchpad, keyboard, wifi, drivers and ports are all working fine.\nSo now I'd like to make Ubuntu my primary OS and have w7 in my back pocket just in case. The logistics of seem easy enough. I plan on allocating the majority of my hd space to ubuntu and leaving 20gb or so to w7. I believe the ubuntu installer will guide me through the partitioning. I've backed up all the movies, music, files, ect. in case of a tragedy.\nThe main foreseeable problem is that it's my first time using a linux based os. I can navigate the GUI easy enough but don't know how to use the terminal at all. I've rooted an old android a year or 2 ago which required some terminal commands that a friend walked me through. \nBefore I take the plunge, I just wanted to ask the community for any tips or advice that can make this transition easier and point out anything that I over looked. Thanks in advance, people!! I look forward to your responses!\n\nA: In lieu of reinstalling, suggest you reboot from the installation media, install gparted if not already there, and use Gparted to resize the partitions, which is easier and saves time. Take a look at these screenshots to see what gparted looks like first. However, I'd give Win7 50GB or so as it is likely to need more than what you expect.\n\nA: First off, i would say that dual boot is not as nice as it sounds. If you want to use your windows system you will have to reboot the computer to access the Win7 machine. \nThe way that i would recommend keeping windows around 'in your back pocket' so to speak, would be to install Ubuntu on a drive all by itself (whether its a new drive so you can keep the old disk around just in case, or you use the old drive and re-format). Then if you want to use Win7 you can create a VM within your Ubuntu installation and run Win7 at the same time you are running Ubuntu.\nThere are a few things to keep in mind about running Win7 in a VM.\nYou will not be able to play games like you would with a regular install. The VM will not be quite as powerful and robust as it will be running with more limited resources, etc. \nYou will however be able to use MS Office, IE, etc just like you would if you where running windows. \nI am doing this on my laptop that is running Ubuntu with Win7, Win8, and a WinXP installation all running through VMware Player (free: Download VMware Player 6.0 | vmware.com)\n", "Q: How to manually run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a'?

Can someone let me know how does Network Manager gets started automatically during the system start-up?\nIs there any script to do so..?

It includes integration with the init system to be started on boot.\nPer-user programs also exist to talk to this service and provide UI for managing network connections, and can be started in multiple ways, including directly being run by the session manager, or indirectly via the use of autostart files.\n", "Q: Skype incoming call problem When I receive a video call from my contact and press the button to except there call, the skype dies.

You are probably missing a library. This is required, yet only if you run 64-bit Skype you would have to install it manually.

You can fix overscan by entering TV settings, as described here: How do I fix overscan on my HDMI HDTV?.\nSettings and names may vary from brand to brand and model to model.\n\nA: Check your screen resolution and make sure it matches your monitors native resolution. \nFor a 32\" TV the native resolution is most likely 1280x720.\nYou can access the resolution settings by doing the following:\nClick on the Gear at the top right of your screen (if you can)\nSelect 'System Settings' then 'Displays' in the 'Hardware' section.\n\nFrom there you can pull down the resolution and select the correct one to match your monitor.\nIf you cannot get to the top right of your screen you can get to it alternatively by:\nPress the Windows key on your keyboard\nType 'Displays' without the quotes\nPress the down arrow on your keyboard twice\nPress 'Enter'\n\nThis should bring up the displays settings.\n\nA: So this is a real zombie thread but its the first answer that came up in Google, what I also found is that if the refresh rate is incorrect but the resolution is, then the desktop appears to be larger than the screen.  I changed the refresh rate from 120 to 60 (120.02 to 59.96) and the screen was set to the correct size and resolution\n", "Q: How to disable xscreensaver lock on suspend?

How can I get access to the source code of standard shared libraries?\n\nA: It depends on the concrete library you're looking for.\nAs an example, let's take a look at /usr/lib/liba52-0.7.4.so (this was simply the first file in my /usr/lib directory).\nFirst, let's find out what package the file belongs to:\n$ dpkg -S /usr/lib/liba52-0.7.4.so\nliba52-0.7.4: /usr/lib/liba52-0.7.4.so\n\nSo now we know that the package name is liba52-0.7.4.

I did it obviously, but it worked for like 5 seconds, then it said that network connection is down and I couldn't connect to my router, even if i could actually see network connections avaible. Then (when installation ended) I rebooted my computer. My network was avaible! I could connect and browse the internet smoothly. Next day I turned on my laptop and I saw my wireless connection is no longer avaible, so I plugged laptop to the internet via Ethernet cable and started to explore internet searching solution for my problem.

I'm trying to seperate my database and my PHP application by using LXC.\nI'm currently having some issues getting my code deployed to one of the containers - I don't understand how this should work.\nMy current setup is a VPS which DeployHQ connects to over SSH - uploads the application from GitHub and runs a few commands.\nBut that solutions doesn't seem possible with my containers - so my question is, what do I do now?\nI can get the code to host machine - but how do I get the code to my container while still being sure user permissions on the guest are correct?\n\nA: The most obvious way is to have LXC behave just like your VPS did. For that you may need to setup a NAT rule on the host which forwards an outside port to the LXC container's port 22.\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 2022 -j DNAT --to 10.0.3.123:22\n(forwards port 2022 on eth0 to the container with IP 10.0.3.123 on its port 22).\nAn alternative is to do it through the host filesystem, there you have two solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Copy directly to /var/lib/lxc/CONTAINER/rootfs/...\n\n*Setup a bind-mount in /var/lib/lxc/CONTAINER/fstab for a path on the host to a path in the container. (e.g. \"/srv/site srv/site none bind,ro 0 0\" will setup a read-only bind-mount of /srv/site on the host to /srv/site in the container. Both paths must exist prior to container startup.\n\n\nIn both of those cases, you'll need to make sure the ownership matches that in your container, so you'll probably want whatever updates that path on the host do a good old chown -R to the right values.\n", "Q: How do I run tor in Saucy (13.10)?

I can even drag the open windows on my Xubuntu desktop around. When I do this the outline of the window I'm dragging appears in UltraVNC... but only while dragging.\n\n*If I click on the \"Select Single Window\" toolbar button in UltraVNC then click on any open window or anywhere on the desktop that window then shows up in UltraVNC and I can interact with it how you would expect. Clicking on the desktop shows me the desktop, but then if I try and open any application (or any other window) it does NOT show up in UltraVNC (as expected since I'm in single window mode) but it DOES show up on the Xubuntu desktop (again as expected). If I then click on \"Select Full Desktop\" it goes back to the black screen with the same behavior as before.\nI searched this forum and also google but did not find anything that was helpful at all. Hopefully someone can offer some guidance as this has me stumped! I've tried using tightvncserver with the live CD, but I have found that it will sometimes open apps in display :0 if a monitor is connected to display :0 and the vnc viewer is connected to display :1. Also, I would rather have a shared view of display :0 and I know the x11vnc server provides this \"out of the box\".\nOh and I just tried this from my Ubuntu 12.04 machine using \"Remote Desktop Viewer\" and the behavior is exactly the same. So it doesn't appear to be an issue with the VNC client.\nUPDATE:\nSo it turns out this seems to be related to the color bit depth set for the vnc server. If I change the bit depth to be anything less than 32 I get full view/control of the desktop. However this has the annoying effect of missing icons in the file manager, desktop, dock, etc... I assume this is because the icons are 32bit color and there aren't any icons of a lesser bit depth for that application/folder/file. In the file manager, this results in EVERY folder icon being missing and a lot of the icons in the settings manager as well. I also have noticed a TON of errors in the vnc log file after xfce starts. \nOh and this was after switching to vnc4server. Apparently this is a known bug in Xubuntu. \nNever found a solution for x11vnc but what I ended up going with is vnc4server and using LXDE as the desktop environment in the vnc session. Sadly, I haven't found a way to make vnc4server share display :0 with the physical monitor.

Win8 launches by first running the booting program in this partition and then passes control to the second partition.\nPartition 2, which Ubuntu calls /dev/sda2 or just sda2, named \"HP\" is the biggest slice and has the Windows operating system.This is where your data lives, your documents, videos and music, under C:\\Data\\USERNAME\\My Documents - and copying those to a flashdrive (same or different) or an external hard drive will save your stuff.  \nPartition 3, /dev/sda3 or just sda3, named \"FACTORY_IMAGE\" is the recovery partition for Windows, and has whatever software HP has provided for restoring your computer's software to the state it was in when HP manufactured it. If re-install Windows to this computer, you would use it to rebuild what's in sda1 \"SYSTEM\" as well as fix any problems with the Windows files in sda2 \"HP\"\n", "Q: Ubuntu running very very very very ... very slow My Specs\nInter Core 2 Duo (2.7 Ghz)\n1 GB DDR2\nIntel Graphics\nSwap Memory 256 MB\nIts running too slow\nSingle text file is not opening up in less than a minute\nChecked system monitor\nCPU and memory are fine but some time swap is at 100% but still slowness is all the time\nWindows-7 with so many services installed works quite well but ubuntu freezes too much even when i open 3 tabs in mozilla\nThinking of increasing swapping size but time taken in opening a file even when swapping is at 4%\nI have 64 bit OS in my system\nI know many will say i should have install 32 bit but the issue is i downloaded iso 0f 32 bit intel\nbut then time of install it was not taking that iso file and i had to download 64 bit file and then it got installed\nNow what are the suggestions\n\nA: The Intel Core 2 Duo is a 64-bit processor, so using a 64-bit OS should be the way to go.\nIt seems to me like your swap is too small. Ubuntu is designed to start using Swap before your RAM is filled all the way up. From what I've seen, the suggested size of your Swap partition is equal to your amount of ram.\nHere is more info on Swap - Ubuntu Wiki Swap FAQ\n\nA: With 1GB RAM, you might want to have a look at another desktop than Unity, such as Xfce or LXDE. They're much more light-weight and will leave you with much more RAM for the actual applications you use and should provide much better performance. \nAll your software and stuff will be just the same, you just log in using a different desktop. \n\nA: Your config should be able to run things decently indeed...\nIf it's a memory issue, you should start by checking if there is any process eating it up, either using the graphical System Monitor, or by running top from the console (then press f, select %MEM with up/down, then press s to sort by mem and q to return to the process list).\nThen investigate based on your findings.\n\nA: *\n\n*With only 768 MB memory (1024-256) you really should be using a 32 bit operating system. With so few ram 64 bit is clearly a bad choice, as 64 bit programs use more memory than 32 bit ones.\n\n*With that few RAM you shouldn't use Unity, so switch to a lighter desktop environment/GUI.\n\n*You should try to set in your BIOS the shared memory of your integrated VGA to only 128 or 64 MB instead of 256 MB. Giving 256 MB from 1 GB of system memory to the graphics is a bad choice.\n\n", "Q: Not all updates can be installed: partial upgrade I'm trying to update my vmware player Ubuntu vm to Saucy Salamander via the Software Updater app. Sadly while it was installing packages vmware player gave this really weird error I've never seen before.

Multiple partitions will be deleted for a default partition layout (usually a root / partition, and a swap partition).\nTherefore we are presented with as warning saying:\n\nThis will delete all of your Windows 7 programs, documents, photos, music, and any other files.\n\nSo yes, your doubt is justified. You should not choose this option if you still had non-backuped data on your drive, or if you wanted to preserve your Windows partition.\nYou can install \"alongside\" of Windows if you had unparitioned space for Ubuntu on your drive, or in case you let the installer do the re-partitioning (i.e. shrinking of the Windows partition) to makes space for Ubuntu.\n\nStill, this procedure though usually safe puts your data at some risk. Therefore we should always make a backup of our valuable data before we do antyhing to our partition, or install a new OS (this is not specific to Ubuntu).\n\nIn case we are familiar with partitioning, or we need a partition layout different to default we can proceed with \"Something else\" as depicted above to make a custom partition layout before installation.\nIn case we had lost our data during the installation process we may have luck to recover at least some of our data. This is not an easy procedure but it can be done.

There are a lot of guides out there which show how to declare and define an array\nfoo[0]=abc \nfoo[1]=def\n\nWhat I am trying to achieve is to declare an array but not define it because it does not have to be define immediately , in most programming languages it will look something like this\nint bar[100];\n\nIs this possible in shell scripting language?\n\nA: In addition to above way, we can also create an array by declare statement.\nThe declare statement with -a option can be used to declare a variable as an array, but it's not necessary. All variables can be used as arrays without explicit definition. As a matter of fact, it appears that in a sense, all variables are arrays, and that assignment without a subscript is the same as assigning to \"[0]\". Explicit declaration of an array is done using the declare built-in:\ndeclare -a ARRAYNAME\n\nAssociative arrays are created using\ndeclare -A name.\n\nAttributes may be specified for an array variable using the declare and readonly builtins. Each attribute applies to all members of an array.\nAfter you have set any array variable, you access it as follows:\n${array_name[index]}\n\n\nA: You can specify that a variable is an array by creating an empty array, like so:\nvar_name=()\n\nvar_name will then be an array as reported by\n$ declare -p var_name\ndeclare -a var_name='()'\n\nExample:\nvar_name=()\nfor i in {1..10}; do\n    var_name[$i]=\"Field $i of the list\"\ndone\ndeclare -p var_name\necho \"Field 5 is: ${var_name[5]}\"\n\nwhich outputs something like this:\ndeclare -a var_name='([1]=\"Field 1 of the list\" [2]=\"Field 2 of the list\" [3]=\"Field 3 of the list\" [4]=\"Field 4 of the list\" [5]=\"Field 5 of the list\" [6]=\"Field 6 of the list\" [7]=\"Field 7 of the list\" [8]=\"Field 8 of the list\" [9]=\"Field 9 of the list\" [10]=\"Field 10 of the list\")'\nField 5 is: Field 5 of the list\n\n\nA: This is actually same as C.\nIn C, we can take array as you preferred. Here, we can take an empty array and then put any values. \nbar=()\n\nSimple For Loop to take value in that array and print that:\nbar=()\nfor ((i=0;i<10;i++));\ndo\n    read bar[$i]  #Take Value in bar array\n    echo bar[$i]\ndone\n\nHope, it helps.\n", "Q: Problem with starting GUI mode in Ubuntu Server Well I have installed the Server version of Ubuntu 12.04.

By default, stat shows long output with plenty of information, but we can use -c, --format, or --printf (note that it interprets backslash escape symbols) options to achieve desired output. For example,\n$ stat -c '%n: %F' /etc/passwd /etc/resolv.conf /etc                        \n/etc/passwd: regular file\n/etc/resolv.conf: symbolic link\n/etc: directory\n\n\n$ stat --printf '%n: %F\\n' /etc/passwd /etc/resolv.conf /etc                \n/etc/passwd: regular file\n/etc/resolv.conf: symbolic link\n/etc: directory\n\nAnother command which we can use is find, which  has -printf option, but differs in conversion specifiers (the %<letter> symbols) and the fact that it outputs filetype in letters (see the man find for filetype to letter correspondence):\n$ find /etc/passwd /etc/resolv.conf /etc -prune  -printf \"%p:%y\\n\"          \n/etc/passwd:f\n/etc/resolv.conf:l\n/etc:d\n\nOf course, if there is a need, we can always make use of [ or test command, but that'll require a little more work; however this way we don't have to rely on anything external;  it's a portable way, although probably not ideal.\n#!/bin/sh\n\ncheck_filetype(){\n    if [ -f \"$1\" ];then\n        if [ -h \"$1\" ]; then\n            printf \"%s\\n\" \"$1: symbolic link\"\n        else\n            printf \"%s\\n\" \"$1: regular\"\n        fi\n    elif [ -d \"$1\"  ]; then\n        printf \"%s\\n\" \"$1: directory\"\n    elif [ -c \"$1\" ]; then\n        printf \"%s\\n\" \"$1: character device\"\n    elif [ -p \"$1\" ]; then\n        printf \"%s\\n\" \"$1: named pipe\"\n    elif [ -S \"$1\" ]; then\n        printf \"%s\\n\" \"$1: socket\"\n    fi\n}\n\nfor arg\ndo\n    check_filetype \"$arg\"\ndone\n\nAnd that's how it would work:\n$ ./checkft.sh /etc/passwd /etc/resolv.conf /etc test.fifo /dev/tty1              \n/etc/passwd: regular\n/etc/resolv.conf: symbolic link\n/etc: directory\ntest.fifo: named pipe\n/dev/tty1: character device\n\nShowing file content\nIf we wanted to get detailed information about the file type as far as contents are concerned, there's two ways to approach things. One, via mime-type and the other - via magic number, the first few bits of a file. While mime-type is originally existed for the purpose of determining filetype on the internet, nowadays many desktop applications rely on querying mime-type information for correctly displaying icons of files and opening them with proper applications.\nFor that purpose, there exists mimetype command:\n$ mimetype /etc/ /etc/resolv.conf  /etc/passwd test.fifo                          \n/etc/:            inode/directory\n/etc/resolv.conf: inode/symlink\n/etc/passwd:      text/plain\ntest.fifo:        inode/fifo\n\nAnd for performing tests with \"magic numbers\" we'd use file command:\n$ file /etc/ /etc/resolv.conf  /etc/passwd test.fifo                              \n/etc/:            directory\n/etc/resolv.conf: symbolic link to ../run/resolvconf/resolv.conf\n/etc/passwd:      ASCII text\ntest.fifo:        fifo (named pipe)\n\nwhich also can do mimetype's job:\n$ file --mime-type /etc/ /etc/resolv.conf  /etc/passwd test.fifo                  \n/etc/:            inode/directory\n/etc/resolv.conf: inode/symlink\n/etc/passwd:      text/plain\ntest.fifo:        inode/fifo\n\n", "Q: btrfs mount options not working I'm running Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS\nI converted my data drives with btrfs.\nI first did apt-get update before installing btrfs-tools.\nUnfortunately, that still only installed version 0.19\nI can mount the drives, but the options compress=lzo and commit=60 are not recognized.\nSince these options were not even present in v0.19, that's to be expected.

Until yesterday everything has always gone fine.

I have lost half of my documents now, some of which are professional works.\n\nA: The best easiest solution is to go to a backup copy, encryption by design makes data recovery nearly impossible, so backups are more important than ever.\nThe encfs man page has some things to say about different versions, stuff like\n\nNote: EncFS reads at most 2k of data from the password program, and it\n  removes any trailing newline.  Versions before 1.4.x accepted only 64\n  bytes of text.\nIf an EncFS filesystem configuration from 1.4.x is modified with ver‐\n  sion 1.5 (such as when using encfsctl to change the password), then\n  the new PBKDF2 function will be used and the filesystem will no longer\n  be readable by older versions.\n\nEven stuff like block sizes & different filename encoding may be unsupported in older versions.\nI'm just guessing, but probably trying all the different versions messed stuff up. If you're lucky then none of the files were correctly mounted so the files themselves may be unchanged, and mounting them with the same version of encfs might still work. Or maybe only the .encfs6.xml \"configuration\" file was changed a little.\nIf the same version of encfs that created the files, or a newer version doesn't work, them maybe you've got a good backup copy of the .encfs6.xml file to decrypt the files. If you DON'T have a good backup then you might be able to re-create a configuration file that will work, I'm trying to find out how to do that myself in case something goes wrong with the config file, and keeping a config file with a password hash & instructions how to decrypt the files isn't terribly secure either. \n\n\n*\n\n*I just tried creating a new empty encfs folder using the same\nsettings & password as another folder with encrypted files. BUT the\n.encfs6.xml files had different  \"encodedKeyData\" probably because of\ndifferent \"saltData\" and different \"kdfIterations\" and trying to\nmount the old files with the new .encfs didn't work (error decoding\nfilenames, checksum mismatches...).\n\n*I'll try changing the new .encfs file to matching saltData &\nkdfInterations, so just different encodedKeyData. --> Still doesn't\nwork! Even with --anykey doesn't work!\n\n\nSo it looks like you really need an identical .encfs6.xml file to decrypt any old files. Recreating a new .encfs with the same options would get almost all the file recovered, but still need the \"encodedKeyData\" \"saltData\" and \"kdfIterations\" so if those 3 options weren't changed in your .encfs6.xml file but maybe some other options were changed, you might still be in luck?\n\n\n*\n\n*Also, DON'T use cryptkeeper! (At least until after you can decrypt your files) Use encfs directly in a terminal, with encfs -f -v  encodeddir decrypteddir to get a hint of what's going on, for all I know it's an old or weird version of cryptkeeper alone that's not mounting your directories correctly, come to think of it.\n\n", "Q: badblocks taking really long time. or is it frozen? \nI issued the sudo badblocks -nv /dev/sda6 yesterday.

Cause and solution? I've an external 500GB HDD connected to my Laptop which runs Ubuntu 12.04. I've formatted the external drive with one ext4 partition which spans the entire disk.\nMy problem is that the disk makes noise every second, because writes occur to it. I'm not actively writing any file to the disk or use the disk otherwise. It's just mounted and should be idle.\nUsing iotop, I can see that with the disk plugged in, some jbd2 process writes to the disk. This jbd2 process does not do anything if the disk is not plugged in. The noise also immediately stops if I unmont the drive, but keep it plugged in.\niotop:\nTotal DISK READ:       0.00 B/s | Total DISK WRITE:    1838.15 K/s\n  TID  PRIO  USER     DISK READ  DISK WRITE  SWAPIN     IO>    COMMAND                 \n 3727 be/3 root        0.00 B/s    0.00 B/s  0.00 %  0.15 % [jbd2/sdb1-8]\n    1 be/4 root        0.00 B/s    0.00 B/s  0.00 %  0.00 % init\n    2 be/4 root        0.00 B/s    0.00 B/s  0.00 %  0.00 % [kthreadd]\n    3 be/4 root        0.00 B/s    0.00 B/s  0.00 %  0.00 % [ksoftirqd/0]\n...\n\nFirst of all, the noise drives me crazy. I work in a quiet environment and this allbeit very low noise is so disturbing somehow.\nSecond, I think that these continuous writes to the disk might cause it's lifetime to degrade. This would be especially important for SSD drives, where the noise isn't present, but the same behavior can be observed. Moreover, I think that writes to the disk should not be necessary, since no user process is accessing the disk and the operating system surely does not need to access an external HDD for its operation.\nWhat causes these write accesses and how to stop them?\n\nA: There is a simple solution for you. Leave the disk connected to your PC for some hours and the noise will stop automatically. A rough estimation for the required time is 1.5h per 1TB of partition size.\nThis is because formatting to ext4 does not completely initialize the file system. A lot of the initialization work is delegated to jbd2, which is responsible for maintaining the journal of the file system.\nWhen formatting, only the necessary information for using the disk is written. While you can already use the disk, jbd2 adds additional information. It's designed in this way so that formatting is quick. The write operations that you are observing after formatting do not affect the performance of the disk, i.e. when you copy files to the disk, the copy process will not be slower because of jbd2 also writing the journal.\njbd2 is designed to do its work in delayed intervals. Because most hard disks have built in power saving mechanisms, which can switch off the disk or park the heads, it is possible that the hard disk detects that it is idle, does some power saving operation like parking the heads, and immediately afterwards jbd2 accesses the disk again, causing it to move the heads again. This is the low noise which you are hearing.\nIf your hard disk's power saving mechanisms can be controlled (some HDDs support this, some don't), you can use the following command to disable the power saving mechanisms, thus silencing the disk durign the time that jbd2 makes initializations:\nsudo hdparm -B 255 /dev/sdXY\n\nwhere you have to replace sdXY by the path to your hard disk partition. If the command fails, your HDD does not support controlling the power saving mechanisms and you can't silence it. Then you have to wait as explained at the top of this answer.\n\nA: From the man mke2fs page and this link it appears that the defaults for formatting an ext4 filesystem are very lazy and leave a lot of the writing work to be finished after the drive is mounted for the first time, and every subsequent time until the work is finished. Most annoyingly, it will very slowly write to the drive every few seconds until it's done.\nThis could be especially bad for a flash drive (card/USB drive) that could have an extremely large block / page size, so writing just a few bytes actually writes to 256k, 512k, or a meg or more. And some flash drives could have an extremely low 1000 write cycles (or maybe 5000 or 10,000, possibly 100,000). Much lower than a hard drive, and even a hard drive would probably benefit more from doing all the writes at once, then being able to sit idle when it really should be idle. And I'm not sure how long it will keep slowly writing to the drive, some people say it could be a few minutes, or a few days. This seems like the worst way to \"format\" a flash drive. \nExcerpt from the man page:\n-E extended-options\n      Set extended options for the filesystem.   Extended  options  are\n      comma  separated, and may take an argument using the equals ('=')\n      sign... The following extended options are supported:\n...\n lazy_itable_init[= <0 to disable, 1 to enable>]\n        If  enabled  and  the uninit_bg feature is enabled, the inode\n        table will not be fully initialized by mke2fs.   This  speeds\n        up  filesystem initialization noticeably, but it requires the\n        kernel to finish initializing the  filesystem  in  the  back‐\n        ground  when  the filesystem is first mounted.  If the option\n        value is omitted, it defaults to 1 to enable lazy inode table\n        zeroing.\n\n lazy_journal_init[= <0 to disable, 1 to enable>]\n        If enabled, the journal inode will not be fully zeroed out by\n        mke2fs.  This speeds up filesystem initialization noticeably,\n        but  carries some small risk if the system crashes before the\n        journal has been  overwritten  entirely  one  time.   If  the\n        option  value  is  omitted,  it  defaults to 1 to enable lazy\n        journal inode zeroing.\n\nSo, if you can initially format (or re-format) the filesystem, this should eliminate the lazy slow format and get it all done at once:\nmkfs -t ext4 -E lazy_itable_init=0,lazy_journal_init=0 /dev/sdxN\n\n", "Q: MacBookPro5,5 Broadcom STA Wireless Driver fails to install (ubuntu 12.04) It says \"Sorry, installation of this driver failed\"\nHere's the log:\n2014-01-09 12:50:31,831 DEBUG: BroadcomWLHandler enabled(): kmod disabled, bcm43xx: blacklisted, b43: blacklisted, b43legacy: blacklisted\n2014-01-09 12:50:36,216 WARNING: modinfo for module wl failed: ERROR: modinfo: could not find module wl\n\n2014-01-09 12:50:36,217 WARNING: /sys/module/wl/drivers does not exist, cannot rebind wl driver\n2014-01-09 12:50:36,258 DEBUG: BroadcomWLHandler enabled(): kmod disabled, bcm43xx: blacklisted, b43: blacklisted, b43legacy: blacklisted\n\n\nA: Use the latest Ubuntu version 13.10 and you will have no driver problems:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?release=latest&bits=32&distro=desktop&status=zeroc\nIf you have 4 gigs of ram or more download:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?release=latest&bits=64&distro=desktop&status=zeroc\nDo a backup of your files, clean install and you will have your Macbook Pro working 100% fine out of the box.\n", "Q: Partial upgrade from 12.04 now can't boot I went through the process of running a partial upgrade in 12.04, now when I reboot, I get stuck at a black screen with a cursor.

I am working with Ubuntu servers since some month, so not too long. I never upgraded an ubuntu version. So right now I am running 12.04 and what I need is 13.04.\nI once hear that I should first upgrade to 12.10 and than to 13.04 (for me that doesn't make too much sense, but I am not sure).\nWhen I run sudo do-release-upgrade -d Ubuntu wants to install 14.04.  As far as I know 13.04 is now the stable version. How to achieve the step by step upgrading? Even though it's not the best way, I want to try it out on my virtual machine.\n\nA: The reason you get 14.04 as an upgrade option is because you are running an LTS version at the moment and the next LTS release is 14.04, and you are only having that possibility because  you are using the -d flag (development).\nYou should not upgrade your servers to a under development version.\nTo enable release upgrades from a LTS you need to tell the upgrade tool that you are ok if the next upgrade is a non LTS.\nYou need to change the option on the configuration file from LTS to normal and then run the upgrade tool without the -d option to upgrade your server to the next non LTS release.\n", "Q: Ubuntu One: file modified dates versus synchronization date I have installed Ubuntu One application on two devices: \n1) Laptop with Ubuntu 12.04 (about two years ago); \n2) Destop PC with Xubuntu 12.04 (added about 2 weeks ago). \nI've just realized that on the new desktop PC the date and the hour of all the Ubuntu One files is set as the date and hour of the first sync (e.g. 2013-12-27), wereas with the web login the date is correct (e.g. 2013-07-27). I checked on Ubuntu One help and this behaviour appears intentional, but this is a very big problem in order to manage my documents.\nCan someone suggest me some trick?\n\nA: There is no trick.

How should I copy to the hard disk so that the directory and its content retain the permissions? \n\nA: Your external drive is using either FAT32 or NTFS, which do not support permissions.  You either need to switch to a unix compatible format on the external drive, or you can use tar ( or the gui archive utility ) to preserve the correct permissions in the archive while it is stored on such a disk.\n\nA: Maybe this is not the case, but it may depend on the filesystem: e.g. FAT32 formatted drives do not support file permissions. have a look at this question: How do I change file permissions on a FAT32 drive?.\nOther than that, I would have a look at rsync manual.  \nrsync -aPv what where\n\n-a is for archive mode, which is often what you want: permissions/owner/group preserved, recursive behavior, and quite a lot of other staff.

If in doubt use the manual pages linked below. \nor to use chmod (read and use carefully):\nsudo chmod -R 777 /var/www/test/public_html\n\nWhich will allow read-write-execute permissions for the owner, group, and any other users. The execute bit is required for directories to work, files can get by with 666 permissions (strictly speaking most files shouldnt need the execute permission, but this is least likely to break stuff and does not require find etc). chmod is much more difficult to 'undo' if needed that the other options.\nHere are manual pages on chown and chmod (these can also be found by running man chown and man chmod.)\nI should add you can give groups of users write access as well (examples  here and here).\nAlso beware giving global write access with the chmod command if you have not as trustworthy users/scripts running on the server etc - I recommend changing the group or the user permissions instead. If using chmod please read up on this and understand what it is doing.\n", "Q: How to get signal strenght of wifi I want to get the wireless signal on a terminal, but only the signal.\nSo no extra info, just the connection speed.\nIt would help a lot!\nEdit:\niwconfig Returns this:\nlo        no wireless extensions.\n\neth0      no wireless extensions.\n\neth1      IEEE 802.11abg  ESSID:\"Goeggies\"  \n          Mode:Managed  Frequency:2.437 GHz  Access Point: B4:82:FE:93:DA:BC   \n          Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n          Power Management:off\n\n\nA: Watch out, signal level and connection speed aren't necessarily correlated.\nUse the iwconfig command:\nwlan2     IEEE 802.11abgn  ESSID:\"something\"  \n          Mode:Managed  Frequency:5.745 GHz  Access Point: 60:AA:4C:D4:53:FC   \n          Bit Rate=144.4 Mb/s   Tx-Power=15 dBm   \n          Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n          Power Management:off\n          Link Quality=64/70  Signal level=-46 dBm  \n          Rx invalid nwid:0  Rx invalid crypt:0  Rx invalid frag:0\n          Tx excessive retries:381146  Invalid misc:1531   Missed beacon:0\n\n\"Bit rate\" indicates the actual transfer speed, while \"Link Quality\" and \"Signal Level\" tell you how strong the signal is.\n", "Q: How to recover Ubuntu from text mode?

Synaptic will fetch all the necessary files asked by LibreOffice.\n\nA: You had already installed the LibreOffice PPA (note the 1:4.1.4~rc2-0ubuntu1~saucy1~ppa1 in your error message). You then followed instructions for removing the standard LibreOffice package without also removing the PPA. This may have been the source of the problems you later experienced.\nMake sure that you have purged OpenOffice: sudo apt-get remove --purge <package_name>. The package name may be openoffice as a metapackage, but you may need to check the .deb files you used when installing OpenOffice for the correct package names. \nOnce that is done, sudo apt-get autoremove to remove any unneeded dependencies from OpenOffice.\nThe LibreOffice PPA looks like it is still in your sources list, so you can sudo apt-get update to rebuild the package lists so you get the packages needed by the PPA instead of the standard version of LibreOffice. If you need to reinstall the PPA, see theLibreOffice PPA for instructions on how to re-install it.\nAfter that, you can install LibreOffice normally.\n\nA: Then try:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nsudo apt-get -f install libreoffice\n\nThe first command will remove unused packages, the second will install libreoffice with the packages it needs.\nI hope it works for you.\n", "Q: update manager and it won't work I'm trying to update Ubuntu 12.04 to 12.10 so I could update to most current Ubuntu.\nwhen I used the \"update manager\" it doesn't work.\nI read that it could be corrupted and to try the code: \nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nthen I get a screen that shows: configuring ttf-mscorefonts-installer with a box that has the EULA agreement in it.\nNothing else is showing and nothing is happening.

So I reckon you don't have to create a function just for the purpose of declaring a new array.\nThis script below demonstrates a direct defining of array:\n#!/bin/bash\nfunction define_array_elements() {\n# You can note the array elements being defined directly, without a prior \n# definition of the variable.\nfor i in {1..10}; do\n    var_name[$i]=\"Field $i of the list\"\ndone\n}\n\ndefine_array_elements > /dev/null\n\nfor i in {1..10}; do\n    echo \"Field $i is: ${var_name[$i]}\"\ndone\n\n(An example borrowed from How to declare an array but not define it? with just a little modification.)\n\nA: Short answer is: you cannot. Bash does not have a way to pass variables by reference, so there's no generic way of doing it; you're left with (ugly) hacks including indirection and/or eval.\nThe upcoming bash 4.3 will introduce nameref variables, which allow you to pass variables by reference, but even this feature falls short since you still risk name collition.\n# example of passing variables by reference in bash 4.3\nupdate_array() {\n    declare -n array=$1\n    array[0]=abc\n}\n\nfoo=( foo bar )\n\nupdate_array foo\n\nprintf '<%s>\\n' \"${foo[@]}\" # outputs <abc> and <bar>\n\nIn that example, if the array was named array instead of foo, it would fail since declare -n array=array is an error (declare: array: nameref variable self references not allowed).\nSee http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/006 for other hacks.\n", "Q: unable to lock admin dir How do I fix a Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock problem? \nE: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)\nE: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?\n\n\nA: Use \"sudo\" at the beginning of your command\nsudo apt-get install   [....whatever....]\n", "Q: Forgot to install login screen after removing unity and installing kubuntu-desktop First I must admit that I did something really stupid.\nI de-installed unity from my ubuntu 12.04 LTS to install kubuntu-desktop as I wanted to try out a different desktop environment.\nThe problem is that by de-installing unity it also de-installed my login screen.\nApparently ldm and gdm are not included in the kubuntu-desktop package.\nNow this means that when I start my ubuntu with grub, I will get a black screen after the splash screen and I can not do anything.

Since we’re actually booting off the live cd, the directory doesn’t really get created anywhere.\nsudo mkdir /media/sda1\n\nThe next command will mount the hard drive in the /media/sda1 folder.\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/sda1\n\nNow it’s time for the command that actually does the magic: chroot. \nsudo chroot /media/sda1\n\nNow you can do whatever you want then exit and unmount the mounted partitions and reboot\n", "Q: How to recover files truncated by `>`? I had a text file hello.txt which contains about 100 lines.I accidentally deleted all the lines by running echo > hello.txt\nNow i want to recover all the 100 lines.Is there any way to recover the lines in that file using terminal commands?\n\nA: You can not get back the contents. There is no mercy.\nBut search for backup files. If you are lucky enough there will be a file named hello.txt~ for hello.txt in the same directory. Those files are usually created by text editors like gedit or emacs when you edit a file.\nIf you have such backup file you can get the contents back (you may get back only a part also). Use the following in the terminal,\nmv hello.txt~ hello.txt\n\nIt is better to have even a part than losing it completely.\n\nA: tl;dr Skip to the end for the working solution.\nI accidentally truncated a file using gedit.  It was truncated from 1800 kB down to 25 kB.\nI wanted to share a few recovery techniques I attempted.  This isn't meant to be a definitive answer, more a collection of answers to try.  This is similar to this post.  \n\nFirst, remount the filesystem as readonly!.  Do this as soon as possible.\nsudo mount -o remount,ro /\n\nIn my case, I was unable to remount readonly, so...\nThe mount command failed. with error mount: / is busy.\nI recommend the drastic step of just hard powering off your machine.  Yes, drastic!  But I don't know how long the remnants of the truncated file will be around.  They may be overwritten at any moment.  Boot up into the Ubuntu LiveCD.\nPer a comment here, I ran telinit 1 which dropped down to init level 1.  This only complicated things so I don't recommend doing telinit 1.  I recommend the hard power down.\nattempt using ext3grep\nFollowing this blog post and this email thread, try using ext3grep.\nHowever, ext3grep failed for me.  I was only able to recover the truncated file.\nattempt using sleuthkit\nsleuthkit is cool toolset.  You'll probably have to install it.  Again, this get's tricky if the truncated file was the / mount.  Again, I recommend hard powering off and then running a LiveCD.\nUsing this blog post, and this blog post, the instructions are essentially\n\n\n*\n\n*apt-get install sleuthkit\n\n*stat truncated-file | grep Inode\nremember the inode number (call it INODE_NUMBER)\n\n*backup the file, then delete it:\ncp -a truncated-file truncated-file.old\nrm truncated-file\n\n\n*\n\n*debugfs /dev/disk-device\n\n*stats \n look for Blocks per group\n This is very likely 32768.

Only the truncated file was recovered.\nattempt using extundelete\nFrom this forum post.\nattempt using grep\nFrom this post, grep for some known string in the truncated file.

Is there a way to share/transfer files between two different computers not on same network using samba or any other tool.\nEg. Sharing a movie with a friend.\n\nA: You're not on the same LAN, so you need to send it over the Internet, and therefore need to use a file transfer service such as Dropbox, MEGA, Google Drive or many, many competitors. You upload the file, select Share and send them a link to the file. \nAlternatively, you could install Samba and Apache on your machine, so Samba can deliver the file to Apache and your friend could pick up the file by selecting it for download from your web page made visible by Apache.

This is because Debian's\n# default Apache2 installation attempts to make adding and removing modules,\n# virtual hosts, and extra configuration directives as flexible as possible, in\n# order to make automating the changes and administering the server as easy as\n# possible.\n\n# It is split into several files forming the configuration hierarchy outlined\n# below, all located in the /etc/apache2/ directory:\n#\n#   /etc/apache2/\n#   |-- apache2.conf\n#   |   `--  ports.conf\n#   |-- mods-enabled\n#   |   |-- *.load\n#   |   `-- *.conf\n#   |-- conf-enabled\n#   |   `-- *.conf\n#   `-- sites-enabled\n#       `-- *.conf\n#\n#\n# * apache2.conf is the main configuration file (this file). It puts the pieces\n#   together by including all remaining configuration files when starting up the\n#   web server.\n#\n# * ports.conf is always included from the main configuration file. It is\n#   supposed to determine listening ports for incoming connections which can be\n#   customized anytime.\n#\n# * Configuration files in the mods-enabled/, conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/\n#   directories contain particular configuration snippets which manage modules,\n#   global configuration fragments, or virtual host configurations,\n#   respectively.\n#\n#   They are activated by symlinking available configuration files from their\n#   respective *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed by using our\n#   helpers a2enmod/a2dismod, a2ensite/a2dissite and a2enconf/a2disconf. See\n#   their respective man pages for detailed information.\n#\n# * The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of environment variables, in\n#   the default configuration, apache2 needs to be started/stopped with\n#   /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl. Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not\n#   work with the default configuration.\n\n\n# Global configuration\n#\n\n#\n# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's\n# configuration, error, and log files are kept.\n#\n# NOTE!

I am new to ubuntu and after some month and a half running it side by side with Windows 7 I decided that it would be my main system, and so I just formatted the machine and installed it as the only OS. However, I still need to run some stuff that don't have options for ubuntu, just like netflix or to manage my Windows Phone system.\nAs a solution, I am thinking about running Windows XP on a VM, I just installed VirtualBox, but after some searching I saw that the best perfomance would be obtained if I install the Guest Additions. I don't intend to share folders, although I am concerned if installing guest additions would somehow expose my Linux system to Windows viruses. And I will probably use the network through windows xp vm either, but I won't surf on the web, I'll only eventually use netflix.\nWell, the question literally is, as said on the title, is windows xp running on a virtual box with guest additions harmful for ubuntu? Does it may lead to viruses issues?\n\nA: As much as I would love to say that a virtualized sandboxed Windows does no harm to you I can't.\nA virtual Windows behaves exactly like a Windows on bare metal, i.e. it is no less vulnerable to malware.\nWhenever your run an unprotected copy of Windows it may quickly get infected by a virus coming from a file, a mail, a website, or an infected storage device. One of the main function all malware have is to replicate. Exactly this will happen on your virtual machine too. \nThe virus will not be able to infect your Ubuntu host, but it may\n\n\n*\n\n*sit in files you had accessed from a compromised Windows (you will want to access files outside the VM sooner or later).\n\n*be able to spread from your infected virtual OS to your network, or to the world wide web. \n\n*in case you let your virtual OS  access data files stored on the host machine, it may even be able to spy on you.\n\n*rare viruses may infect your router no less from a virtual machine. Just open a browser there to access your router's administration page from a VM if you are skeptical.\n\n\nSo in summary an infected virtual Windows will not be able to infect your Ubuntu installation, but it will still be a risk to you or to others. It is therefore strongly recommended to protect a virtual Windows with appropriate anti-virus software before you give it access to your network, or the internet.\n\nA: You can run Windows inside Virtualbox and not worry about viruses, UNLESS you do shared folders.  It would be possible for a Windows virus to drop executable Windows code in those shared folders, which could be run in WINE and, yes, screw up some things.  That's as far as I can think it through.\nNetflix in Virtualbox will probably perform quite terribly.  The graphics, in particular, will probably suck.  I've had a lot of success with this:\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/130372/how-to-watch-netflix-on-ubuntu-with-the-netflix-desktop-app/\n\nA: Both systems are separated. If Windows XP gets infected, it won't affect the normal functionality of Ubuntu. Virtual machines are sandboxed environments to run others OS's. There isn't any issues with Ubuntu if your Windows system gets infected.\nThis means that Linux will not protect Windows and whatever happens with Windows will not affect the normal functionality of Ubuntu.\n\nA: I don't think it will lead to any harm. As far as I remember, the only way for someone to mess with your Ubuntu machine if you installed Wine application in it, and of course you didn't configure your UFW (firewall). A successful attack from Windows users will be as follows ; \n* You installed wine application in ubuntu \n* you forget to configure UFW (the firewall)\n* you unintentionally clicked on a malware link from your win xp virtual box\n* you opened ports and didn't secure them.\nIn your case, you are going to install WINDOWS XP in Virtual box, and VBox will create a disk image which will be impossible for users to get outside the disk image and mess with your Ubuntu, however, if you have wine in your ubuntu, and wrongly clicked a malware link from your Win XP virtual box, that will lead the attacker to your ubuntu and execute commands and harm your computer. source : check ubuntu security\n\nA: In normal use, viruses, Trojans and you cannot infect or damage your Ubuntu from within a Windows VM. \nNEVER SAY NEVER\nThere are exceptions. The biggest risk is in sharing a partition with critical system files, or other important files between the VM and real machine. If you must share a partition, create one for that purpose and back the files up or move them out as quickly as you use them.  \nI was never successful creating and sharing a partition for use between XP and Ubuntu, so I set up and use DropBox for my file sharing and make daily backups of my DropBox folder from Ubuntu each night.\nI set up and used XP VMs in DropBox for over 5 years.  I only installed XP SP3 and NO UPDATES! I never used anti-virus software except Windows Defender and an on-line scanner that I occasionally use just to double check.  I never had a virus and don't expect I ever will.  \nHere is how I protect myself:\nI created one VM and installed XP (I now use Windows 7) and installed a few programs I would use on any Windows machine such as LibreOffice, DropBox and Skype.  Then, instead of cloning the drive, I create a new VM \"linked\" to the original drive.  This creates separate paths, or instances, of the drive that are unique.  Each machine has a specific purpose.  Most are used for only one piece of software such as my Bible Software.  Others have multiple programs such as the one I use for video editing.  I have three pieces of software I use to edit videos. \nI NEVER browse the net or do downloads from Windows.  I do that from Linux.  On rare occasions I find a need to visit a specific website, but then I have reason to trust the site.  \nI always close the VM when I am not actively using it. When I do share files, I open the files in DropBox and save them there.  At night, Ubuntu backs up all the files in DropBox to a dated folder in my backup drive.  \nIf I ever find an infection or have a problem, disaster, etc. in Windows, I just roll back to the previous image of the machine and keep moving. All my important information is saved in DropBox or it's backup.\n\nA: As people above have said:\n-an infected VM can infect your network\n-Always remember, that although virus infections on Linux are really really hard to achieve, they are theoretically possible.\n-never underestimate the ingenuity of crackers\n\nA: Windows viruses are not compatible with Linux, imagine your virtual machine to be a sandbox. Trust me, you wont have any problem with viruses on your Linux, although you can always install an antivirus on Windows! I promise you will never get a virus from your virtual machine although you don´t install it.\nPS: I recommend: Malwarebytes and AVG (install both).\n\nA: If a shared folder gets infected, I don't think Windows viruses can affect Ubuntu. Check this out\n", "Q: My ubuntu decided to remove itself One week ago, my ubuntu has died. That day, I decided to do smth (I can't remember, what exacly I wanted to). And to do this I was informed by system to update libc++ to newer version. As aptitude cuffed me trying to do that \"global\" update, I understood, that it should be done manually only. So, when I tried this:\nsudo apt-get remove libc++*\n\nI pressed Enter and went to kitchen to take a coffee. So, it was very stupid by my side, 'cause when I returned back, my jowl just fell off: when I accepted the removing of libc++, I skipped my favourite f***ing autoremove function.\nIt said, that it also gonna remove nearly all the system.

How can I recover these packages back into system?\n\nA: You could try reinstall the apt package from here : http://linux.softpedia.com/get/System/Software-Distribution/apt-4598.shtml\ninstall it through the command : \ncd /path/to/the/downloaded/folder\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nand then reinstall the whole ubuntu-desktop package using the command :\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install aptitude && sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop \n\nThe problem could be that you don't have the autoconf automake etc. the compile tools packages to compile apt... Give a try.\n\nA: I would take the hard disk out of the computer and connect it to another computer, extract the information you need and then do a clean install of Ubuntu 13.10.

However, the terminal still works. I have tried update the graphic drivers (nvidia gtx 760), but it did not work. What should I do?\n\nA: I am assuming that you trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS base on the tag. I had a similar issue. Try executing the following.\nSudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-lts-precise\n\nI also have documented few more tips here. \n", "Q: dualboot ubuntu13.10 and win8.1 already have 4 primary partitions I have a Toshiba Satellite L855-150 and I would like to install Ubuntu without erasing my Windows8.1 Installation.\nThe problem is I have four primary partitions on my laptop which are:\n\nHow do I proceed to install Ubuntu next to Win8.1 on my Laptop?\nWhich one of the four primary partitions can I erase to install Ubuntu?\n\nA: You have more than 4 partitions, and none is contained in an extended partition. GParted shows six partitions. If any of them were logical partitions, GParted would show an extended partition container for them and, in the horizontal bar that graphically represents the disk, would show them physically inside that container. If this were a traditional partition layout, it would be invalid/impossible because it would mean you already have more than 4 primary partitions.\nThis indicates that this is not a traditional \"msdos\" partition layout--most likely it is a GPT partition layout, which is associated with UEFI as oldfred mentions.\nIn that situation, you are not limited to four.\nSo, go ahead and install Ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*If possible, back things up first. At the least, make sure any important data (such as documents) are backed up.\n\n*See Installing Ubuntu Alongside a Pre-Installed Windows with UEFI.\n\n*See How do I install Ubuntu? and Install Ubuntu 13.10 for more general information.\n\n\nA: AT YOUR OWN RISK -- I cannot under-state that\n(option (a))\nI see two partitions in the drive, /dev/sda5 and /dev/sda6.  /dev/sda6 is probably for recovering Windows if it chokes -- as it is hidden.  You could use that.  It's pretty small but large enough to install ubuntu.\n(option (b))\nBoot with a Live CD and shrink that 585gb partition down (to half, maybe?) and install ubuntu in the unallocated space.\n(option (c))\nGet a larger drive (2tb?), copy the contents of your existing drive to it, and then install ubuntu.\n\nA: Windows only ever allows 4 primary partitions, because the phrase \"primary partition\" is only applicable to MBR partition tables and MBR partition tables only allow four primary partitions.\nIn the above screenshot it was clearly shown that you had 6 partitions which exceeds 4,so it's not MBR.\nIn GPT partition table (available since Windows Server 2003 on 64-bit versions of Windows) you can have up to 128 partitions and do not need to distinguish between \"primary\" and \"extended\" partitions.\nSo you can erase any one of the partition other than the Windows partition and install Ubuntu on it.\n", "Q: How do you enable tap-to-click via command line? You can use this to reverse scroll direction (natural scroll):\nxmodmap -e \"pointer = 1 2 3 5 4 7 6 8 9 10 11 12\"\n\nYou can also set it back again with xmodmap -e \"pointer = 1 2 3 4 5 7 6 8 9 10 11 12\"\nand this to switch the left and right buttons:\nxmodmap -e \"pointer = 3 2 1\"\n\nAnd change it back with xmodmap -e \"pointer = 1 2 3\"\nBut how do you enable tap to click from command line? Preferably with one command, and not permanently.\nBy the way, yes I do know this exists:\n\n\n\nA: When setting the Synaptics Tap Action value using xinput, you may need to specify a sequence of numbers. For example, to get normal primary and secondary tap functionality on my Logitech touchpad, I had to do this:\nxinput set-prop --type=int --format=8 \\ \n    \"Logitech Rechargeable Touchpad T650\" \\\n    \"Synaptics Tap Action\" 1 1 1 2 1 3\n\nI believe this means:\n1 1 1 2 1 3\n: :\n1 1 - enable single-finger tap and assign it to Button1 (left-click)\n    : :\n    1 2 - enable double-finger tap and assign it to Button2 (right-click)\n        : :\n        1 3 - enable gesture for middle-click and assign it to Button3 (middle-click) \n\n\nA: Xmodmap is of no help here. Xmodmap controls physical-to-logical mappings of buttons and keys, not the physical process that generate events in the first place.\nThe tool for this kind of options is xinput. The property name depends on your touchpad model, it may be something like\nxinput set-prop \"SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad\" \"Synaptics Tap Action\" 0\n\nRun xinput list to see the names of available devices and xinput list-props \"the device name\" to list properties of a device.\nSee also Dynamic Input Configuration with xinput on the wiki, and some examples.\n\nA: You can use gsettings:  \ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.touchpad tap-to-click true  \n\nWhich enables tap to click. \ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.touchpad tap-to-click false\n\nWill disable it.  This is the same as changing it in System Settings.\n\nA: Based on the main answer, given that I had to modify some of the instructions there:\nThe command to enable tap-to-click is therefore of the form:\nxinput set-prop \"device\" \"action\" 1\n\nTo read the \"device\" you have to do\nxinput list\n\nBut it may prove difficult to identify the device in that list. Some tips: it is probably under \"Virtual core pointer\"; it may contain terms like \"Syn\", \"Synaptics\", \"Touchpad\", \"Alps\", \"Glidepoint\". e.g., mine was AlpsPS/2 ALPS GlidePoint                  id=16, but I had to guess; as I was not sure I have tested if that was the correct ID number by disabling/enabling the touchpad with xinput --disable 16 and xinput --enable 16.\nNow, to get rid of all the confusing names, ID-numbers can be used instead of the device and action names. \nSo, to read the \"action\":\nxinput list-props 16\n\nWhich listed among others:\n    libinput Tapping Enabled (297): 0\n\nSo, using ID numbers instead of names, the final command was:\nxinput set-prop 16 297 1\n\n\nNote: for some reason, using the name of the action within the command, as suggested by the main answer, wouldn't work for me (xinput set-prop \"\"AlpsPS/2 ALPS GlidePoint\" \"Tapping Enabled\" 1), while using just the name of the device did work (xinput set-prop \"AlpsPS/2 ALPS GlidePoint\" 297 1).\n\nThis command can be useful in systems where there is no GUI for such setting, like in the LXQT that I was testing at the date of the post.\n", "Q: Laptop Heating Lenovo Z570 I have just started using Ubuntu.

I woke up this morning to find my computer frozen and my graphics were not rendering correctly either.

During the process of trying to troubleshoot a problem with logging in via ssh from another linux system (also running ubuntu) I discovered that stopping and starting the server don't seem to work properly.  I have googled the problem extensively and found many (sometimes conflicting) answers.  Below are the results for the four methods I have found\nroot@newton:~# invoke-rc.d ssh stop\ninitctl: Unknown job: ssh\nroot@newton:~# service ssh stop\nstop: Unknown job: ssh\nroot@newton:~# /etc/init.d/ssh stop\nroot@newton:~# \nroot@newton:~# stop ssh\nstop: Unknown job: ssh\n\nIn no case do I get feedback that indicates the daemon stopped.  The same goes for trying to start the daemon.  When I look at /var/log/auth.log I see that the daemon apparently stopped multiple times but not because of the above commands.  It only stops when I kill it using killall sshd.  After which it immediately restarts.  Somehow something appears to be completely broken with my system.  Does anyone have any ideas on how to sort it out?  Thanks for any help.\n\nA: Thanks to all who have posted trying to help me sort this out.  I wanted to update all on the current status and explain what I did to put the system in its current state.  You will notice in the original post that I tried sudo service ssh start, etc. and obtained various unhelpful errors.  Eventually, I did \n#touch /etc/ssh/sshd_not_to_be_run\n\nand then \n# killall sshd\n\na few times.  At this point sshd stopped restarting (as you would expect).  I then ran\nsudo service ssh status\nssh stop/waiting  \n\nsudo service ssh start  \nssh stop/pre-start, process 22510  \n\nsudo service ssh status  \nssh stop/waiting  \n\nsudo service ssh stop  \nstop: Unknown instance:   \n\nsudo service ssh status  \nssh stop/waiting  \n\nsudo service ssh start    \nssh stop/pre-start, process 22579    \n\nsudo service ssh status    \nssh stop/waiting\n\nThese results are expected given the presence of sshd_not_to_be_run file.  After subsequently removing this file I was able to run:\nsudo service ssh status\nssh stop/waiting\n\nsudo service ssh start\nssh start/running, process 25063\n\nsudo service ssh status\nssh start/running, process 25063\n\nsudo service ssh stop\nssh stop/waiting\n\nsudo service ssh start\nssh start/running, process 25141\n\nsudo service ssh status\nssh start/running, process 25141\n\nsudo service ssh stop\nssh stop/waiting\n\nsudo service ssh start\nssh start/running, process 25247\n\nIt looks like things are in order for now.

Select Region and Language sidebar option. The screen displays options to change language and format settings. In the Input Sources option, there is a small keyboard logo which in clicking shows the current layout settings for the keyboard. You can check if it matches the layout of your keyboard. If it doesn't, set a language (region) which matches your layout. \n\nA: Language-setting alone might not be the issue - there's a specific design choice to do that in some applications. If you have a font with yen-symbol defined at certain points in the character set some apps (hello Chrome/Chromium!) will automatically replace backslash with yen-symbol for you. Super helpful! Exactly what everyone expects.\nIf you are going in circles with this one, you might want to experiment with font variations. Since this is emulating behaviour that came in with IE6 (though similar behaviour dates back to the days of MS-DOS and code-pages at least!) it is unlikely that this will be fixed any other way soon.

From a shell prompt enter:\nsudo apt-get install php-pear\n\nYou will be prompted to confirm the install. Just press “y” and enter. If all goes well you should see it download and install the php-pear package.\nNow you will need to install the php5-dev package to get the necessary PHP5 source files to compile additional modules. Enter the following from a shell prompt:\nsudo apt-get install php5-dev\n\nIf you do not install the php5-dev package and try to install a PECL extension using “pear install”, you will get the following error:\nsh: phpize: not found\nERROR: `phpize’ failed\n\nThe PECL_HTTP extension requires an additional dependency package to be installed. You can probably skip this for other extensions:\nsudo apt-get install libcurl3-openssl-dev\n\nNow we are finally ready to actually install the extension. From a shell prompt enter following but substitute “pecl_http” with the PECL extension name you are installing:\nsudo pecl install pecl_http\n\nThe installer may ask you about some specific options for the extension you are installing. You can probably just hit enter one or more times to accept all the defaults unless you want to set specific options for your implementation. If all goes well, the module should download, build, and install.\nOnce the install is complete, it will probably ask you to add a “extension=” line to your php.ini file. Open up the php.ini file in your favorite text editor and add the line under the section labeled “Dynamic Extensions”. On Ubuntu the php.ini file seems to be located in the /etc/php5/apache2 folder:\nsudo nano /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini\n\nIn this example, the pecl_http extension install asked me to add “extension=http.so”.\nNow that the php.ini file has been updated, Apache will need to be restarted so the new extension will be loaded:\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart \n\nsource\n\nA: In addition to @Ask's answer I also needed to do:\nsudo apt-get install libpcre3-dev\n\nbefore running pecl install pecl_http because I was getting this error about pcre.h:\n\nfatal error: pcre.h: No such file or directory\n  compilation terminated.\n\nAlso, instead of editing the php.ini file I created a new file called pecl-http.ini in the conf.d subdirectory of where the php.ini file was, ( on ubuntu /etc/php5/apache2/conf.d )\nAnd I needed to add in three lines:\nextension=raphf.so\nextension=propro.so\nextension=http.so\n\nFinally, since this installed version 2.0.6 I couldn't use the http_get_request_headers function but needed to instead use the namespaced version, \\http\\Env::getRequestHeader() see more details here\nps: don't forget to restart apache when you're done ( service apache2 restart )\n\nA: In addition to the answers of Maythux and cwd, you might not want to edit your php.ini file because these changes might get lost on updates.\nDebian (and thus Ubuntu) handles php modules in same way like apache modules. Have a look at /etc/php5, you will find directories like this:\napache2/\ncli/\nmods-available/\n\nWhen you look into mods-available you see several files like:\ncurl.ini\ngd.ini\njson.ini\nmysql.ini\n…\n\nTo enable/disable these available mods for all APIs (apache, cli, cgi) you can just use the commands php5enmod or php5dismod like so:\n$ sudo php5enmod curl\n\nrespectively \n$ sudo php5dismod curl\n\nThese will create (or remove) symbolic links to the module config file in apache2/conf.d/ and cli/conf.d/.\nYou can also specify the sapi to enable/disable the mod for (apache in this case):\n$ sudo php5enmod -s apache2\n\npecl install might not create a configuration file for raphf (and other modules installed with it) but you can create it on your own:\n$ sudo touch /etc/php5/mods-available/raphf.ini\n\nThen write in the following lines:\n; configuration for php raphf module\n; priority=20\nextension=raphf.so\n\nThe default priority is 20. It might depend on the type of the module which priority you have to use. For raphf 20 seems fine. (Update: if you're looking for pecl_http, as of version 2 it has to be loaded after rapfh and propro, so set the priority in the mods-available/http.ini to 30.)\nWith that you can enable the module:\n$ sudo php5enmod raphf\n\n(Note: my answer depends on Ubuntu 14.04 but might work in an equal manner for 13.04, see http://www.lornajane.net/posts/2012/managing-php-5-4-extensions-on-ubuntu )\n\nA: Now days, install PEAR this way, to get it from the source:\nwget http://pear.php.net/go-pear.phar\nphp go-pear.phar\n\n", "Q: hostapd gives error nl80211: Register Action command failed: ret=-19 I'm trying to get hostapd working on a RT3290 (pci-based) network adapter, and a Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS release.

Some suggest installing a custom script which will communicate with the gandi zone files via the API and auto update. Others (possibly out of date) suggest using a free service provided by dynDNS or no-ip.\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm retisant to install any more code on my server than I have to in the spirit of trying to be secure whilst I learn as much as I can about what every line does. So preferably an external service would be good (correct me if I'm being stupid here).\n\n*I can't seem to find a 'free Dynamic DNS service' that applies to me in the way these guides state. Perhaps I am confused but no-ip.com but as my domain ends in .co.uk I only seem to be able to use the paid for services (which I don't object to but would then prefer to start shopping around).\n\n\nMight someone let me know if times have moved on and free services for .co.uk are currently not available, or if I'm likely misunderstanding something about managing hosts / domains.\nI then assume once i've resolved this it should be as simple as pointing my router to my DNS account, which in turn will point to my gandi-domain, thus allowing me to get to my home server via my domain name!\n\nA: Free dynamic DNS services seem to be disappearing, so be prepared to pay for the service. This is still less expensive in most cases than securing a static IP address from your ISP.\nRegardless of who you choose for service from any of the dynamic DNS service providers, they should be able to provide service for a .co.uk domain. They will provide a list of nameservers that you then enter into the nameserver settings in your gandi.com domain account settings. Then follow the instructions from the dynamic DNS provider for setting up your DNS records with them. In your router, enter the account info for your dynamic DNS account. If and when your router IP address changes, it will notify your dynamic DNS provider of the change, who will in turn update your DNS A Records with the new router IP.\nThis is exactly the setup that I have used for my home server using dyn.com (formerly dyndns.org) and it works with no problems.\n", "Q: This video is currently unavailable - Youtube I'm having problems with playing some Youtube videos but not all of them. \nI have tried using the html5 Youtube player according to this answer but that didn't work and I have issued following command:\nsudo apt-get install chromium-codecs-ffmpeg-extra\n\naccording to this answer but that doesn't work either.

The purpose is to connect R (which is also running on the Server)to the database. I somehow got stock because I did not find a very comprehensive manual on how to do this. \nSo the first thing I did was to install the MySQL Database ODBC Driver with\napt-get install libmyodbc\n\nas described here. Now I think I would need to enable ODBC in PostgreSQL. So normally if you want to achieve this you have to do it when manually building PostgreSQL. Since my database is already built and everything set up I wanted to do it afterwards. PostgreSQL-Manual states that: \n\nTo install the ODBC you simply need to supply the --enable-odbc option to the configure script when you are building the entire PostgreSQL distribution. The library will then automatically be built and installed with the rest of the programs. If you forget that option or want to build the ODBC driver later you can change into the directory src/interfaces/odbc and do make and make install there.\n\nOk. So Source doesn't come with the program if you install it with apt-get so I downloaded the source from here. I followed the steps described on the website to create the directory. Now, inside this directory src/interfaces/ there is no subfolder called odbc. So I also can't  make the driver. \nNow I googled this but I did not find any post of somebody that had a similar issue. So can anybody here please help me? I'm no database expert I only wan't to set this up to Work with R and PostgreSQL. Thx in advance. \n\nA: Like most software projects, installation instructions in the PostgreSQL manual only apply if you have followed the rest of the instructions in the PostgreSQL manual. In other words, if you've installed from source as the manual describes. If you installed from distro packages, then the installation instructions in the PostgreSQL manual that refer to a source code installation do not apply and you must use distro-specific methods to install components according to your distro packaging.\nNeedless to say, the PostgreSQL team cannot possibly provide instructions for all distros and packaging methods, but I want the docs to make it clearer for new users that later parts of the source install docs do not apply if you didn't install from source.\nIn this case, you will need to install a package for Ubuntu that contains the postgresql odbc driver for unixodbc. apt-cache search postgres odbc reveals that the package is called .... odbc-postgresql.\nSo:\napt-get install odbc-postgresql\n\nBTW, you might prefer to look into PL/R, which is R embedded within PostgreSQL.\n\nI'm going to propose a patch to the Pg manual to address this point of new user confusion. \nIn this case a manual amendment would not help you, because you're reading a 10-year-old version of the manual. See the version links on the top of the page? Yeah. You're reading the manual for version 7.2, released in 2002-02-04.

If you don't specify the source and sink when loading the module, e.g. with:\npactl load-module module-loopback latency_msec=1 source=1 sink=0\n\nthen the source and sink are picked automatically. To get the name of your sinks and sources you can use pactl list sources and pactl list sinks. From that output you can use in the above command the number id of the source, or its name, which can be something like alsa_output.pci-0000_00_14.2.analog-stereo.\nBut the easier way is likely to just simply use \npactl load-module module-loopback latency_msec=1\n\nand then launch pavucontrol, go to the Recording tab, change Show: Applications to Show: All streams. Now you can see from where the loopback module is recording, change it to the source from which your piano sound is coming. Then go to the Playback tab, and do similiarily and change the output of the loopback module to the sound sink where you would like to hear your piano.\n", "Q: How do I make Ubuntu ask for a password when logging in?

To see it try in terminal,\ntype ls\n\nThat is why you have colored outputs. But when you use sudo ls it uses /bin/ls which does not have the color option with it. So it fails to show colored outputs. \nIf you try /bin/ls you also will have color less output. Or try sudo ls --color=auto which should give you color.\n\nA: I believe this is because your user octavian and the elevation of that user's permissions happens in two different shells.\nUbuntu by default uses bash as he shell for users.  When you run commands through sudo, the shell changes to sh.\nHere is a screenshot demonstrating the different shells.\nYou can see the first time I run ls, I'm in the bash shell.  You can tell because the prompt notes my username, hostname, and current directory.\nWhen I switch to sh, the prompt changes as it's a completely different shell with different features.\n\nThere are tons of different shells available, all with different features, prompts, and customization options.  One of the most customizable shell is zsh.\n", "Q: Removing a bad sector from an NTFS partition. Badblocks gave me an output. now what?

Nevertheless I still like the simmetry of having the virtual printer\n  --- you can set it as your default printer, use it with old programs that do not use the unified printing interface, etc. YMMV.\n\nI often find that the option \"print to file\"can be quite flaky. The best method to print to PDF in my opinion is the following: \n1) install a virtual PDF printer: \nsudo apt-get install cups-pdf\n\n2) Now you have a printer called \"PDF\" that you can choose.\n3) Printing in that printer will result in a .pdf file in the folder PDF under your home directory. You may need to create it with mkdir $HOME/PDF (it's case-sensitive). \nAdvantages: \n1) This is seen as a normal printer. ALL programs that can print can print to it, so you do not need the \"print to file\" option. For example you can easily do \nls -l | lpr -pPDF \n\nand have a pdf file with the output of your command. \nCaveats: \n1) Move files from there because if you print a file multiple times the last version will  overwrite previous ones. This is avoidable with a little configuration file editing --- just open the file /etc/cups/cups-pdf.conf, it is very well documented, and search for the line #Label 0 and change it into Label 1 (or 2 if it suits you better). \n2) you do not decide the file name, and you need to move it where you want it. (It seems it can be solved, but it's quite convoluted).\n3) Sometime upgrading the system disables the printer. Don't know why. Reinstalling cups-pdf solves the problem. \n4) Color management and quality control is tricky.\n", "Q: Finding URL to VirtualBox Ubuntu Apache2 server I am new to Ubuntu and have Apache2 running in a virtual box on my machine.  I am trying to access this server on my Windows machine..  I am assuming that I need to find the ipAddress and the port to access the server.\nI have tried Identifying my IpAddress using the following\nlfconfig \n\n\nAnd then checking which port Apache is running\nlsof -i etc..\n\nI'm not really sure what all this information means.. But I am assuming that If I find the Ip Address and port I can navigate to it on my windows pc.  e.g. http://10.0.2.15:27017\nAnyway I have tried just about every cominbation of ipAdress/port listed and can't figure it out.  \nDo I need to implement any port forwarding?  I found the following screen in my vm settings but don't know what to try from there.\n\nWould appreciate any direction or guidance on how I can access the apache2 server.\n\nA: There are a number of factors at play, mainly your Apache configuration and the network setup of your VM.\nYou are on the right track with the Apache setup, but I would use netstat to find the port your Apache is listening to:\ngomo@wks120:~/$ sudo netstat -puant | grep apache | grep LISTEN\ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1577/apache2    \ntcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:443             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1577/apache2\n\nThis shows I have a process called apache2 with PID 1557 listening on port 80 and 443 on all interfaces (0.0.0.0).\nFor the network setup part, it depends on what type of networking you are using for your virtual machine (found in VirtualBox under each VM's Settings --> Network page. The most common options are either bridged or NAT.\nBridged means the VM will be granted access to the physical network your host computer is connected to. Things would work as if you plugged the VM onto the same switch your computer is plugged in to. You typically run virtualized servers this way.\nNAT means a local network will be created just for your VMs. This is similar to how your average home router/wireless AP works: VMs can access outside networks (such as your LAN or the internet) but other computers can't reach your VMs.\nAll in all, set up bridged networking (restart the VM's network or the entire VM after changing this) and check your apache port. You should be able to connect without problems from your host machine.\n\nA: Stop your VM and open its settings in the VirtualBox (OSE) Manager\nGo to the Network tab\nSelect the network mode to host-only\nSave the settings\nStart the Ubuntu VM\n", "Q: How to install latest version of tomcat on ubuntu using apt? apt-get install will only install 7.0.26, what is the prescribed way to get the latest version which is 7.0.47.\nI'm on 12.04.

If you want to run the latest version of Tomcat then you are using the wrong version of Ubuntu. You may want to upgrade to the latest non-LTS to get the latest version of Tomcat available from the Ubuntu repositories.\nYou may be interested to read Why don't the Ubuntu repositories have the latest versions of software?\n\nA: See tomcat@launchpad: 7.0.47-1 is available as of 14.04 so with apt-get it will not work (you would pull in more than just tomcat since your system will find lots of newer versions).\nIn case anyone wants to know the 2nd best method: you can download the debian installer files and have Ubuntu Software Center install it (3rd method would be to install from a download from the apache site). \n\n\n*\n\n*Package details can be found here and the deb installer can be found here. It depends on:\nadduser\ndebconf (>= 0.5)\ntomcat7-common (>= 7.0.47-1) \nucf \n\nAfter you download the DEB file just doublclick it from Nautilus and if installable it is technical a manual method but as easy as it can be. \n\nA: If you do not want to manually download & install Tomcat (either from source or using some .deb package installed via dpkg), then clearly the only possibility of installing it is through the package manager (i.e., apt-get).\nThe package manager retrieves the package automatically from a repository on the Internet. The Ubuntu devs have not yet made version 7.0.47 available in the official repositories for 12.04 (yet), so at best you could hope for a third-party repository, such as a PPA.\nUnfortunately, there does not seem to be such an Ubuntu third-party repository for Tomcat. At least, I just searched, rather extensively, and could not find one.\nSo your options are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Upgrade to a new Ubuntu release (of course, more recent Ubuntu versions are not long-term support, so it may not be an option for you). In the current release, namely, Ubuntu 13.10, ou will find Tomcat 7.0.42. Also, in the upcoming Ubuntu 14.04, Tomcat 7.0.47 will be available. Ubuntu 14.04 will also be long-term support, so that may be an interesting alternative, but you will have to wait until April.\nBrowse to Details of package tomcat7 at packages.ubuntu.org to find exactly what version is available in what Ubuntu release.\n\n*If you do not want to upgrade your Ubuntu: wait for it ;) Ubuntu 12.04 will be supported through early 2017, so at some point Tomcat 7.0.47 will certainly be made available for Ubuntu 12.04. Keep in mind that this is a stable, long-term support release, so new packages just do not come in that fast. This is a sensible in approach in production environments. You don't always want the newest and greatest. You want something stable.\n\n*If neither upgrading nor waiting are acceptable options for you, you are only left with installing Tomcat manually. Refer to How to install Tomcat 7.0.42 on Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS? to find out how to manually install the newest Tomcat in Ubuntu 12.04 (that thread is about Tomcat 7.0.42, but the method is analoguous for Tomcat 7.0.47, of course).\n", "Q: Will UBUNTU work smoothly with 1Gb ram and intel atom dual core processor?

But following advice from here I created the directory /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d and a file /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-myconfig.conf with contents\n[SeatDefaults]\ngreeter-session=unity-greeter\n\nand I get the unity greeter back.\n\nA: I didn't test it, but I suspect that @SampoSmolander might have the best approach.\nAlternatively, I had success by removing the gtk greeter -- apparently this is what XFCE uses.\nsudo apt-get purge lightdm-gtk-greeter\n\nThere still remains the tricky issue of getting rid of XFCE's mouse-themed greeter wallpaper:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I change the wallpaper of the login screen?\n\n*How do I set the LightDM wallpaper in Ubuntu 14.04?\nNote: It looks like multiple desktop environments install the lightdm-gtk-greeter package (including XFCE and MATE).  Interestingly, once you remove that package, the configuration files that @SampoSmolander discusses are no longer present.\n\nA: I had a similar problem. @SampoSmolander's answer might be the right way.\nWhen using Ubuntu 14.04 you'll have to add the line\n[SeatDefaults]\ngreeter-session=unity-greeter\n\ninto /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-myconfig.conf\nI wrote a detailed how-to, but I don't know if it works, because LightDM reconfiguration seems to have solved the problem for me.\n\nA: cd /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d && sudo ln -s 50-unity-greeter.conf 99-unity-greeter.conf and reboot the system.\nThe problem is caused by lightdm-gtk-greeter installing file called 60-lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf which overrides the unity greeter. I guess we should be able to just do sudo update-alternatives --config lightdm-greeter and select unity-greeter but unity-greeter package is incorrectly built and it does not support update-alternatives.\nThe above command workarounds the problem by creating a symbolic link with higher number so it can override the incorrect greeter selection. I'm using symbolic link to be better prepared for the future in case the file 50-unity-greeter.conf is ever upgraded by system package.\n\nA: Try:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm\n\n\nA: You could try enter this in the terminal, and it might fine this way I say:\n sudo apt-get autoremove lightdm\n sudo apt-get install --reinstall lightdm-gtk-greeter \n\nif this dos not work you could try enter again:\n sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a lightdm-gtk-greeter \n\nand it might work fine this way too.\n\nA: I had a similar problem, I lost the greeter on user switch.   The solution was in the package light-locker. Just reinstall, (or install if it was removed)\nsudo apt-get install light-locker\n\nIn my case it was uninstalled, but the key is the package.\n\nA: To set the unity greeter as default, in Ubuntu 16.04 login screen, edit the file\n/usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/60-lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf\n\nand change the \"greeter-session\" line to \"greeter-session=unity-greeter\"\n", "Q: Are PDF files opensouce? I was just wondering if PDF formats are opensource.\nI've seen openoffice save a document in ODT format in contrast to DOC or DOCX. Is there alternate file format to PDF?\n\nA: The PDF format itself is freely usable and the relevant patents can be used freely (although they apparently remain under Adobe's control so this could potentially change, IANAL regarding patent law).\n\nAdobe Systems made the PDF specification available free of charge in\n  1993, PDF remained a proprietary format, controlled by Adobe, until it\n  was officially released as an open standard on July 1, 2008, and\n  published by the International Organization for Standardization as ISO\n  32000-1:2008.\nIn 2008, Adobe published a Public Patent License to ISO 32000-1\n  granting royalty-free rights for all patents owned by Adobe that are\n  necessary to make, use, sell and distribute PDF compliant\n  implementations.\n\nSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format\nThe ODT format is part of the OpenDocument specifications, which are also free to use, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument#Licensing.\n\nA: PDF is largely based on PostScript. It's very common to find graphics files and academic papers in PostScript (.ps file extension) format.\nHowever, if you are looking for the advanced features of PDF files such as fillable forms, security signatures, and such you will not find those features in PostScript files.\nThe Linux/UNIX world has long had useful tools for working with PostScript files such as  GhostScript, which also happens to work with PDF files.\n", "Q: help, can't empty my trash folder on external hdd I've been searching for this problem on the webs but none of the solutions i've found worked for me.\nThe problem is that I have an external hard drive and the trash folder won't delete.\nthe complete path of the problem folder: \n/media/Elements/.. .Trash-1000/expunged/2969272896\nFor some reason if i just press delete when that folder is selected it delete's as a normal folder, but it will always reappear.\nDeleting the folder in windows won't work either.\nThere are no files in the folder.\n\nA: If the trash has nothing else important in it:\nrm -rf /media/Elements/.Trash-1000/\n\nYou may want to try as root as well:\nsudo rm -rf /media/Elements/.Trash-1000/\n\nAnother method would be to use srm - it would wipe over the data and remove it.

Okay, so I have the demo Ubuntu up and running on my bootable USB device. But I want to install it so that Ubuntu will save my files that I install and download etc. But if I choose to install Ubuntu, will it install on my USB device or will it install on my hard drive and erase Windows 8?\n\nA: On a ubuntu live-usb,if you run the Ubuntu installer,it tries to install the Ubuntu Os on the hard-disk.\n\n\n*\n\n*If you choose install Ubuntu alongside windows option,the installer formats all the partitions other than windows partition(C partition) and install Ubuntu on it.\n\n*If you choose erase the disk and install Ubuntu option,the installer formats the whole disk and installs only Ubuntu.\n\n*If you choose something else option,the installer force you to manually select the partition where Ubuntu is going to be installed.\n\nA: If you want to Install it on your USB here some tips\n1.Your installation Media (Installer) and your installation target (whre youwant to install) must a diffrent disk (e.g your Installation media is USB A and your Installation target is USB B)\n2.If you want to install it on a USB drive install it from a Virtual Machine or on a machine that have no OS.If you install it from a computer that already have an OS (Windows for example) it will overwrite it's current bootlaoder and switch it to GRUB bootloader\n3.Make sure your USB drive is fast enough\nSo if you want to Install your Ubuntu on a USB Flashdisk install it from VMWare,or you can install it directly from your computer but maybe you want unplug your HDD first so your Installer won't read your Windows (atleast that what i do )\n\nA: when you chose \"install ubuntu\" it will ask whether you want to install it \"alongside\" your current OS or if you want to replace the OS with ubuntu. choosing alongside will keep your current OS and will install ubuntu. It will let you take a piece of a partition on the computer for ubuntu.\n...it won't install ubuntu on the live usb itself\n\nA: If there is space on the USB stick, you can install on it. The same for the hard disk as well, though this would create a dual boot on one hard disk.\nYou chose when you reach this stage - go for 'Something Else':\n\nFor the memory stick:\nIf you select the something else install, to install to your memory stick, make a / partition (where the system files go) and a /home partition (where the user's files are stored). Make sure your memory stick is selected as the boot loader device. The memory stick should really be bigger than 6Gb, and it might be helpful to have the installer on another USB drive.\nA better guide may be found here.\n\nWarning - may be a bit complicated to do...\nFor the hard disk it may display a dual boot option (something like this).\nIf not, chose 'Something Else', and create a /home partition, and a / partition. You can put swap in as well, which is where data will go if the RAM is full, or if the computer is hibernated (I did not think this would be worthwhile on a memory stick).\nIf there is not enough space, you should be able to resize existing from the install disk, or from Windows Disk Manager. Try to create a space bigger than 10GB, especially if you are doing swap.\nAs I have not tried anything like this for a while, corrections are welcome.\n", "Q: Can't get past splash screen on 13.10 boot I have just updated to 13.10.  The system boots and loads, and the GUI login screen appears.  After logging in, however, I am left with the colorful splash screen and nothing else happens.  I can use ctl-alt-F1 to get to a terminal login, but I don't know how to analyze this problem or to converge on a solution.  Together with the Ubuntu upgrade, I installed a graphics card...Radeon R7 260X.  According to the AMD site, there is a Linux driver for this card, but I don't know how to install it, and I don't even know if that is the problem.  Any help would be much appreciated.\n\nA: You should try logging in a terminal session (Ctrl+Alt+F1 to get to it) and read the content of /var/log/Xorg.0.log to get some more clue regarding your problem.\nAlso, once you get to the terminal session install the package jockey-common and then run jockey-text -l to get a list of the available drivers and the one that's been used.\n", "Q: Connection was refused by other side: 111: Connection refused I am running 25 scrapy jobs, each has 50 concurrent requests on a heavy machine (with Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS). I am using proxies to send requests. After 15 minutes or so, I get this error from almost all of the requests:\nConnection was refused by other side: 111: Connection refused.\n\nI contacted the proxy service provider and they say that this problem is from handling sockets on my side.\nSo my scripts send 1250 concurrent requests. Is there anyway I could find out where the problem is? Is there a connection limit on Ubuntu?\n\nA: I did a small amount of research on this and i've found a very similar thread on serverfault here. It seems that your kernel might be a limiting factor in this particular case, as such a high amount of concurrent connections is not very common. The accepted answer states it might be due to the ip_conntrack table overflowing. \nOn Ubuntu (Server) a fix could be setting some custom parameters in /etc/sysctl.conf \nnet.ipv4.netfilter.ip_conntrack_max = 32768\nnet.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle = 0\nnet.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 0\nnet.ipv4.tcp_orphan_retries = 1\nnet.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 25\nnet.ipv4.tcp_max_orphans = 8192\nnet.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 32768    61000\n\nPlease take a look at the thread I linked to, and always be very careful with custom configurations. \n\nA: I had the same problem.

I have this persistent and annoying issue. When I first boot up, my desktop can't resolve any DNS names unless I edit the /etc/resolv.conf file and remove the entry for name-server 127.0.0.1 and change it to 8.8.8.8\nThis is only a temporary fix because this file is reset after each reboot.\nI googled this for hours and tried multiple solutions but can't find a solution. I think there also might be a bug associated with this issue? Not sure though.\nCan someone help?\n\nA: Edit: This answer is assuming you are connected using DHCP, which most people are\nYou have two options;\nFirst, properly setup the DHCP server that is giving your machine it's local IP address.  If you use a router, go into the router's settings and make sure it is providing its clients (you), proper DNS servers.\nIf you are not using a router and get your DHCP directly from your ISP, call your ISP.\nThis is most likely the issue you have.\nSecond, solution if you can't do the first solution is to manually edit the connection rather than /etc/resolv.conf.  Doing it this way should survive a reboot.\nOn the top panel, click on the network applet and go to Edit Connections.  Choose the connection that you're having issues with and click Edit.  On the IPv4 Settings tab, choose Automatic (DHCP) addresses only and fill in the DNS servers you want to use.\nThis will restart the connection, only pulling an IP address, while still using the DNS servers you just specified.\n\n\nA: Try putting your nameserver entries into /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base which is one of the files used by resolvconf to create the resolv.conf file.\nWhile this technically will not permanently fix the issue, it is a workaround and SHOULD put those DNS servers into your resolv.conf file every time.\nHeads up, though! Network Manager will usually overwrite these nameservers with the first three DNS nameservers you specify in the configuration for the connection(s) being used, so to make SURE this applies, edit the connection in network manager, then disconnect from the network, and reconnect.  That will force Network Manager to accept the new DNS nameservers for that connection.\n\nEven bigger heads up!  VPN settings will usually override whatever settings you have configured.  You will need to make sure the remote VPN servers are giving you legitimate nameserver addresses, or you will need to manually configure the nameservers via Network Manager or the VPN software you are using.\nTherefore, if you are using a VPN and are running into this issue, then the remote VPN or your Network Manager VPN settings are wrong and need to be changed.\n\nA: This is maybe not a complete solution,it's just a temporary solution untill you can resolve it.\nyou can make a permanent change in resolv.conf\ntry this Link :)\n\nA: make your nameserver/dns server ip entry in /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base file as follows\n$ cat /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\n\nWORKING: resolvconf copy the contents of /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base in dynamically generated /etc/resolv.conf\n", "Q: Ubuntu on Advent Torino X700 I am intested in buying the Advent Torino X700.

I have to upgrade an Ubuntu 12.04 to the last stable Ubuntu 13.10 but I have some doubts about how do it:\n1) The first doubt is related to the fact that reading online seems that is not a smart thing update directly from 12.04 to 13.10 but I read that is better do it by steps:\nfrom 12.04 to 12.10, then from 12.10 to 13.04 and finally from 13.04 to 13.10\nIs it true?\n2) Trying to perform the previous operation (the update from 12.04 to 12.10) following this official tutorial: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/QuantalUpgrades\nI have followed the previous tutorial and I have activate the notification \"For any new version\" of the system but in the Update manager appear to me a strange thing, infact it say to me that is available the new 14.04 release\nReading online I see that 14.04 will be the new LTS and that this will be available in April of 2014, so what is this? is it a beta version or something like this?\nI can't chose to upgrade to 12.10 or 13.10. \nWhat can I do to upgrade my system to the last stable version?\nTnx\nAndrea\n\nA: It is not recommended to directly update 12.04 to 13.10 directly.It'll be better if you upgrade to 12.10 and then to 13.04 and eventually 13.10. The releases are made up so that you can go only from one version to another consecutively or from one LTS version to another LTS version. Otherwise it may result into buggy system and will ruin your experience of using ubuntu.\nNow if you really want to install 13.10 you can download .iso from \nhere and boot it to virtual machine via live usb or whatever you prefer.\n", "Q: Fixing conditional in an interactive backup script I have made a simple backup script \nCode:\nfunction backups_remove_file\n{\n    echo \"\"\n    echo \"2. Make Backups Of Files(s)\"\n    echo \"\"\n    echo \"Which File You Wanna To Make Backups?\"\n    read back\n    echo \"What's The File's Name Should Be After Backups? And Where?\"\n    read after\n    read -p \"Continue (y/n)?\" CONT1\n    if [ \"$CONT1\" == \"y\" ]; then\n        tar -cvpzf \"$after.tar.gz\" \"$back\"\n        echo \"Backups File Successful !\" ;\n    else\n        echo \"Backups File Unsuccessful !\" ;\n    fi\n}\n\nBut there is one small problem I could not fix. When it shows\nWhich File You Want To Make Backups?\n\nif you write for example \"test\" after that, and for the next question\nWhat's The File's Name Should Be After Backups? And Where?\n\nif you write for example \"test1\", then there will be a safety issue if they want to continue or not if type y it will output:\ntaking: test: can not state: No such file or directory\ntar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors\n Backups File Successful!\n\nThe output in that case should be Backups File Unsuccessful!. What should I do to get the expected output in this case?\n\nA: I think a better script would read command line input - something like:\n#/bin/bash\necho \"Shall back up $1 as $2 - press Ctrl-C to exit if this is not what you want\" \nsleep 3\necho \"Backing Up...\"\ntar -cvpzf $2.tar.gz $1\necho \"Backing up of $1 Complete\"\nnotify-send -t 8000 \"Backing up of $1 complete\"\nexit\n\nYou could then enter the command like this:\nCOMMAND \"/path/to/input\" \"/path/to/output\"\n\nThe notify-send will also send graphical notification, so it will notify you when it is done.\nThis is just my suggestion - I will take a look at yours in a second...\n\nThe problem with your script is this. It will say successful, as $CONT1 = y, so it will execute the backup tar...command, and then echo Success. It will only echo unsuccessful if you enter the continue parameter not as y. So for this particular script, a better end to it would be (this only changes what is echoed in the terminal output):\nif [ \"$CONT1\" == \"y\" ]; then\n        tar -cvpzf \"$after.tar.gz\" \"$back\"\n        echo \"Backing up File finished!\" ;\nelse\n        echo \"Did not backup\" ;\nfi\nexit\n\n\nThis seems to work:\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"\"\necho \"Which File you want to backup?\";\nread input\necho \"Where do you you want it to be backed up? (include .tar.gz extension)\";\nread output\nread -p \"Continue (y/n)? \" CONT\nif [ \"$CONT\" == \"y\" ]; then\n        tar -cpf \"$input\" \"$output\" || 'echo \"Backing Up Failed\" && exit;'\n    echo \"Backing Up Successful!\"\nelse\n        echo \"Did not backup\" ;\nfi\nexit\n\nThe || after the command means that it will only execute 'echo \"Backing Up Failed\" && exit;' if the command produces errors, which will cause it to echo that it has failed and then exit. If the command does not produce errors, it will ignore that, echo Successful, and exit.\nThis may have problems with path's to some files, so you may want to use the other script I suggested...\nHope this helps.\n\nA: I am adding another if condition in your script. It will work as you wish. See the modified script below.\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfunction backups_remove_file()\n{\n    echo \"Make Backups Of Files(s)\"\n    echo \"Which File You Wanna To Make Backups?\"\n    read back\n    echo \"What's The File's Name Should Be After Backups?

This means that it will always echo 'successful'. Bash does not automatically raise an exception/error if something went wrong.\nThis is fixed by using the tar ... in an if statement so its exit code influences which path it takes form the if statement.\n", "Q: Synaptic package Manager Broken packages How to remove broken packages using synaptic package manager \ni already isntalled it but after selecting status it is not showing broken packages options it is only showing installed, installed (manual) not installed.\n\nA: Broken packages that was not shown on synaptic are viewed and purged through the terminal,\nIf you want to view the broken packages,then run this command\ndpkg -l | grep ^rc | awk '{ print $2 }'\n\nIf you want to remove the broken packages,then run this\nsudo apt-get purge $(dpkg -l | grep ^rc | awk '{ print $2 }')\n\n", "Q: Is there a way to merge multiple gnome-terminal windows into a single tabbed window?

MP3 formats are patented, and the patent holders have not provided the necessary licenses. Ubuntu also excludes other multimedia software due to patent, copyright, or license restrictions, such as Adobe Flash Player and RealPlayer.\nThat doesn’t mean you can’t play .mp3 files in Ubuntu, it just takes a bit of work (not much).\nFirst enable the Multiverse repository.

I was wondering how the program updates itself? There is no repository for Mathematica visible in the Software Center. I am just asking out of interest.\n\nA: Mathematica is a proprietary application and not part of Ubuntu, and not available on the Ubuntu store. If it provides updates to itself, it does it completely outside the realm of the Ubuntu archive and packaging framework. You didn't install it using that framework, so there's no reason it would be updated through it.\nIf you want specific details about how it works, you should contact Wolfram for support on the product.\n", "Q: Crontab script entry not working beginner here.\nI have a script called \nupdateTf2.sh \n\nIt's contents\n#!/bin/bash\n/etc/init.d/srcds stop\n./steamcmd/sh +login anonymous +force_install_dir ./tf2 +app_update 232250 +quit\n/etc/init.d/srcds start\n\nLocated here\n~/home/user/updateTf2.sh\n\nIf I run ./updateTf2.sh from terminal it asks for a password, I type it in, and the script runs successfully.\nWhen I put it in sudo crontab -e like this\n10 9 * * * /home/user/updateTf2.sh\n\nIt doesn't run.\nWhat am I doing wrong? I've seen simular tickets about this topic on here but have not seen a clear answer.\nThanks for the help.\n\nA: The commands executed by cron don't have a terminal connection, so they cannot interactively ask for user responses. If the desired remote server asks for a password with anonymous login you will have to use another mechanism to authenticate the program steamcmd.sh, like configuring it to use some Steam AppID as depicted in How to install and use SteamCMD.\n\nA: This is a very very common mistake. You need to use the full path in scripts (rather then the relative path).\nchron runs with sh using minimal environmental variables.\n", "Q: Firefox stuck opening rar files as videos When I try to open downloaded rar files, firefox attempts to handle it like a video by default. Choosing \"other\" option and heading to /usr/bin/file-roller isn't a permanent solution.\n\n\nA: Try right clicking on the file in the File browser (Files or Nautilus), selecting 'Properties', then choose the 'Open with' Tab, find the program you want to to open the file with by default (I would guess you want to use 'Archive Manager', and then clicking on 'Set as default'. This should tell firefox (and any other application) which program to open the file with by default.\n\nA: This is not a problem with firefox, it is a problem with the site you are downloading from. Your screenshot says: \"which is: unknown\", that means the webserver didn't send the correct mime type of the file, so firefox doesn't know what kind of file is this, so he just pops up a \"random\" application for it. (For me for unknown types always GIMP is suggested by firefox, for you it is Videos.) \nFirefox doesn't decide the filetype based on the file's extension, it decides based on the mime type received from the server.\nThe server response from the site you are trying to download contains this:\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\n\nSo you see this:\n\nA well behaving server would send this for a .rar:\nContent-Type: application/x-rar\n\nand the download window would look like this:\n\nIt says: which is: RAR archive.\nTo make this work properly you will have to contact the site's admin and ask him to set up their server to send proper mime type. \n(Or maybe there is a firefox extension which can help in these cases to decide based on the extension, but I don't know any.)\nUPDATE:\nI did found a firefox extension to solve this (although I don't know how proper it is to use it, as this is a problem with the server, so it should be solved there): Force Content-Type Addon. Install it and add a new rule:\n\n\n*\n\n*URL: .rar$\n\n*Old Content-Type: application/octet-stream\n\n*New Content-Type: application/x-rar \n\n\n\nAfter this every URL which ends in .rar and has a content-type of application/octet-stream will be changed to a content-type of application/x-rar, and you will get this:\n\n\nA: Suggest choosing Save File, and only try to open after the download completes.

I thought editing the root's crontab (rather than putting the script into /etc/cron.daily/ for example, which I've tried) would work.\nI don't want to include the password in the script for obvious reasons, which is why I am trying to employ the encrypted file.\nHow can I get the cron-executed script to successfully utilize the credentials I'm specifying?\n\nA: I had the same problem with mysqldump 5.7.13 in a script launched by crontab. You can set the .mylogin.cnf file location using the MYSQL_TEST_LOGIN_FILE environment variable before calling the mysqldump command :\nexport MYSQL_TEST_LOGIN_FILE=/root/.mylogin.cnf\nmysqldump --login-path=mysqldump [...]\n\n\nA: What you need to do is set your schedule line as follows\nHOME=/root\n# m     h       dom     mon     dow     user   command\n15      0       *       *       *       root   /home/username/mysqldump-daily\n\nNote the \"user\" column.

While you can (at least with recent versions) use it to monitor a command that runs during a user session, it's clumsy.\nWith Upstart, if you want to run a service that displays a GUI window, that service can only run while you're logged in. Rather than start and stop based on runlevels, you need to start and stop based on GUI login and logout events.\nstart on desktop-session-start\nstop on desktop-shutdown\n\nYou also need the service to be able to reach your display. GUI applications use the DISPLAY environment variable to determine where to display. Under normal circumstances, your GUI session will be the display called :0.\nenv DISPLAY=:0\n\nThe application also needs to obtain permission to access the display. This permission takes the form of a “cookie” (a password) which is automatically generated when your GUI session starts and stored in the file .Xauthority in your home directory (or another file indicated by the XAUTHORITY environment variable, depending on your display manager). If your display manager uses ~/.Xauthority and you run the service as your user (which you should do anyway), you don't need to set XAUTHORITY. For more details, see Can I launch a graphical program on another user's desktop as root? and Open a window on a remote X display (why “Cannot open display”)?\nsetuid evsc\n\n\nInstead of Upstart, you can use a supervision tool that only does supervision and not system service management. Ensure a process is always running lists several possibilities. Let's use supervise from daemontools. Create a directory somewhere, e.g. ~/.planeEtoiles. In this directory, create an executable called run which is the application you want to keep running:\nmkdir ~/.planeEtoiles\nln -s /home/planeviz/src/of/apps/myApps/planeEtoiles/bin/planeEtoiles ~/.planeEtoiles/run\n\nAdd the command supervise ~/.planeEtoiles to the applications automatically started at login. To stop the service, use the svc command:\nsvc -t -x ~/.planeEtoiles\n\nThe last piece of the puzzle is running that svc command on logout. This feature seems to be missing, or if not it's very poorly documented. If you're using GDM, there's a workaround which is to run from /etc/gdm/PostSession/Default, but that file runs command as root, which is not a good solution, and doesn't apply to Lightdm.

Since my card reader is on PCI, it should perform just as if it was installed on a HDD (60m/s write), right? Also i'm thinking on setting a swap partition on SD card since i did not set a swap partition on SSD, is that advised?\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: Do not set a swap partition on the SD card. If you are running your host on an SSD then you don't need a swap partition, if you want one anyways it should be placed on a medium of equal to or higher speeds to prevent it from slowing down your system.\nIf you want to run a Windows vm off an sd card you can do so, but I would be wary of poor performance. The card you listed sounds fast, but often times cards don't get the max speed across the entire card. I tried to find the product page for your card and this is the page I found:\nhttp://www.sandisk.com/products/memory-cards/sd/extremeplus/\nThe first thing I read when visiting the product page was \"With read speeds as fast as 80MB/s\", which suggests that at times you will experience lower speeds and there is no guarantee that you will ever see the 80MB/s. However this card is intended for use in devices that do several MB/s writes so you may be okay. I would not advise it though. VMs often don't get the full device performance which will amplify any short comings.\n\nA: As I know, VirtualBox does not use swap, it always use RAM. So, swap will be used for other applications. I don't think you need swap with 8Gb RAM. It would be better to buy more RAM if it's not enough.\nTo achieve maximum speed on reed/write operations you need some additional filesystem parameters to be set on SD-card. I did it myself using this guide http://blogofterje.wordpress.com/2012/01/14/optimizing-fs-on-sd-card/ .

Maybe the application can do an import of the database file.\n\nA: With reference to answer above by @Sqerstet I simply downloaded the script firefox_decrypt.py, saved it on my Desktop and created a text file too on Desktop and then ran following commands:\njignesh@j-home-pc:~/Desktop$ python firefox_decrypt.py > my_pass.txt \n\nMaster Password for profile /home/jignesh/.mozilla/firefox/nfa9v0da.default: (I didn't had one so I left it blank and hit Enter)\n2018-02-01 12:25:07,223 - WARNING - Attempting decryption with no Master Password\n\njignesh@j-home-pc:~/Desktop$ \n\nAnd hurray I got all my saved login creds in plain format in the text file .\nMore information about where in Home folder Mozilla saves the data can be found on their support page. Quoting below the section for Passwords below for quick view:\n\nPasswords: Your passwords are stored in the key4.db and logins.json files. For more information, see Password Manager - Remember, delete, change and import saved passwords in Firefox. \n\nBTW before I was using this awesome add-on Password Exporter which was just fit for the Import and Export of Saved Passwords. Unfortunately this add is incompatible with Firefox Quantum version and hence I had to find some alternate solution and I ended up here and found the firefox_decrypt.py script the most easy to use compared to other offered Add-ons like \n\n\n*\n\n*LastPass Password Manager\n\n*Roboform Password Manager\n\n\netc\nTo me they felt too much for my purpose of just exporting my passwords.\nThanks.\n\nA: There is an add-on for exporting your passwords.\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/addon/2848\n\nA: According to the support page the password data can be found in ~/.mozilla/firefox/key4.db and ~/.mozilla/firefox/logins.json files. These files needs to be read with some sqlite editor. There are other alternatives like extensions that do so too.\nLastPass, Keepass and others password managers that use Firefox plugins, can import the data from Firefox directly and replace the password manager.\n\nA: The latest versions of Firefox store passwords, encrypted, in a JSON text file, logins.json, in your Firefox profile folder at /home/you/.firefox/ or /home/you/.mozilla/firefox.\nThis Python script will decrypt them all into a text file. Basic usage:\npython firefox_decrypt.py\n\nAnd answer prompt if necessary. Hit Enter on \"master password\" question if none set.\nUpdate to clarify how. Do this in your home directory.\n\n\n*\n\n*wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unode/firefox_decrypt/master/firefox_decrypt.py (get raw script)\n\n*python firefox_decrypt.py > out.json (export logins to file)\n\n\nA: LastPass Password Manager is a very good add-on that let's you store and encrypt your passwords in Firefox. It automatically exports (and deletes) the passwords stored locally and plainly during installation to your LastPass Vault. It also has a feature for generating a random password for a particular website.\nThis, for me, is one of the best security add-ons for Firefox. It's easy to use and manage.\n", "Q: Start byobu setup with server reboot I would like to start my byobu setup at a server reboot.

After long hours of research I feel I am stuck. \nI was booting from a USB, let me outline what I did (apologies if it's too detailed)\nBefore the installation: \n\n\n*\n\n*deactivated Secure Boot\n\n*stayed in UEFI boot mode\n\n*deactivated Fast Startup\n\n\nInitially, when I booted from the USB (in the EFI mode), I got a kernel error right away. Then I:  \n\n\n*\n\n*pressed e to enter grub after booting \n\n*added in grub libata.force=noncq at the end of the line starting with linux. \n\n\nThis solved the problem and the installer could run. (Apparently it has something to do with the SSD.)\nDuring the installation I created three partitions, all of them as logical partitions, the first two as EXT4.\n⠀/root (10GB)\n⠀/home (40GB)\n⠀swap (2GB)    \nI know I should avoid having two /boot/efi partitions, so I just left the Windows 8 one as it was.\nThe installation finished successfully. Afterwards, the computer would boot into Windows 8 straightaway. I used the Live USB to install Boot Repair and followed the instructions given by community/Boot-Repair\nOnce running Boot repair, the pop-up window said there were WinEFI files detected, and asked me whether I would like to proceed via changing them or not. During the first trial, I said \"yes\". The link produced was: http://paste.ubuntu.com//6726194. \nAfter that even Windows 8 stopped booting, and the error is that no operating system was found.\nAs suggested by the Boot repair program itself, I went through the procedure again, and this time I pressed \"no\" when prompted about the WinEFI files. The link produced was: http://paste.ubuntu.com//6726299. Unfortunately, again it didn't help and I can't boot either of the operating systems. The computer either suggests recovery for Windows or entering BIOS.\nI tried changing the booting options to Legacy from UEFI, but this didn't help.\nI would be really grateful for any hints.\n\nA: Your configuration is very strange, and your Boot Repair outputs indicate that you've omitted many critical details from your summary. Most importantly:\n\n\n*\n\n*You've converted the system from having a GUID Partition Table (GPT) to having a Master Boot Record (MBR) partition table. (I'm assuming it had GPT initially because you said it's a new computer; almost all computers that ship with Windows 8 or 8.1 use EFI and GPT.) The use of MBR has significant implications for all your OSes. Most importantly, Windows will boot from an MBR disk only in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode.\n\n*Sometime between your two Boot Repair runs, you repartitioned and installed the Clover boot loader, and perhaps a Hackintosh setup.\n\n*You don't have a proper EFI System Partition (ESP), although your /dev/sda1 is close. To be an ESP, it needs to have an MBR type code of 0xEF, not 0x0B. Even with this change, though, some EFIs might not recognize the ESP as such. (OTOH, some might use it just fine as it is now -- this is an area that's not well-documented or well-tested.)\n\n\nBasically, a setup like yours is so far from the norm that you can't count on a tool like Boot Repair to handle it properly. You'd need to be an expert to get it to work. In fact, speaking as such an expert (I maintain the rEFInd boot manager), I wouldn't touch that configuration. Instead, what I recommend is:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wipe the partition table clean and create an empty GPT setup.\n\n*Create a 550MiB ESP and whatever other partitions you care to create at this time. (You can instead leave some or all of the remaining partitions to be created by their respective OS installers, though.)\n\n*Install Windows in EFI mode.\n\n*Install Ubuntu in EFI mode. See my Web page on such installations and the Ubuntu wiki on EFI installations for guidance.\n\n*If you want to triple-boot with a Hackintosh, you can set it up at this time, but I can't offer much advice about EFI-mode Hackintosh boot loaders. Ask about this on a Hackintosh site. If you need to use a BIOS-mode Hackintosh boot loader, though, you might find rEFInd useful for launching the Hackintosh boot loader. rEFInd can boot a BIOS-mode boot loader if you uncomment the scanfor option in refind.conf and include hdbios among its options. I'd hope that there'd be a native EFI-mode Hackintosh boot loader by now, but I've not kept up with Hackintosh developments.\n\n\nAlternatively, you could use a strictly BIOS/CSM/legacy-mode boot with an MBR. This is likely to be more familiar, but the world is moving quickly towards EFI and GPT, and OS X might work a little better with GPT.\n\nA: You still have a live-usb, right?\nYou might want to install the grub from one of your linux partition, since sometimes, boot-repair fails. Let me explain.\nWe will first boot from a live-cd, then chroot in your linux partition, then call update-grub. To \"chroot\" means to make the shell think the root directory is in a different place. It allows terminal access to a partition as if you booted from if. You can use that method to run an apt-get update, too.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from live-usb.\n\n*In a terminal (or shell: ctrl+alt+F1), call sudo fdisk -l\n\n*Find your linux partition. I will assume your partition is /dev/sda1 from now on, but it may be sdb2 or else\n\n*Call sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt.\n\n*Mount the filesystems too. This allows you to call the partition’s commands while chrooted.: \n$ mount -t proc none /mnt/proc\n$ mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev\n$ mount -o bind /sys /mnt/sys\nNow, just call sudo chroot/mnt, and you're in your partition. We'll install, check and update the grub:\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\nsudo grub-install --recheck /dev/sda\nsudo update-grub\n\nNote that you only call the drive name (sda) and not the partition name (sda1).\nHope this helps!\no7\n", "Q: /etc/crypttab ignored on boot I wanted to setup encryption with dm-crypt and LUKS, but I set it up manually, not during installation process (I created LUKS partition and /etc/crypttab file properly). But the encrypted partition defined in /etc/crypttab doesn't mount at boot at all. Otherwise, when mounted manually, everything works.\nIt was a clean Ubuntu 13.10 install.\n\nA: The problem is, that only package cryptsetup-bin is installed by default on ubuntu 13.10 (and AFAIK on older versions). That means, that you can create and manipulate dm-crypt partitions, but you also need cryptsetup package, which contains startup scripts for mounting dm-crypt volumes at boot.\nsudo apt-get install cryptsetup solved that problem.\n", "Q: How do I get Thunderbird and Ubuntu (WUBI) and Windows to share a profile? I have a friend who is running Xubuntu 12.04 through WUBI.  They have Thunderbird installed in both Xubuntu and Windows and a single IMAP account set up in both (same IMAP account).\nThe problem is that the email provider only allows 20MB of storage. So the user need to get the message off of the IMAP server and into a local folder. However, he wants to be able to have access to those local folders in both Windows and Xubuntu. I'm sure there's away for Thunderbird to share access to these folders but I'm not sure how. Do I just need to set his local folders in Ubuntu to point to the folder in Windows or is it more complicated?\nThanks\n\nA: Well, I think you should be able to share whole profile between Windows and Xubuntu.\nIn order to do that you may do following things:\nMove the profile from Thunderbird on Xubuntu to a place that you can easily access both from Windows and Xubuntu. (for instance your Windows system partition). You have to find where you profile is actually stored. The profile folder should be located at:\nhome/your_username/.thunderbird/xxxxxxxxxx.default\n\nObviously replace your_username with your username ;)\nIn place of 'xxxxxxxxxx' you'll see some randomly looking signs. It varies for each profile. Copy the whole folder to place explained before.\nNow you have to set access to the moved profile from Xubuntu's Thunderbird. Run thunderbird's profile manager:\nthunderbird --profilemanager\n\nCreate Profile > Next > Choose folder, and choose folder path to where did you copy your profile.\n\nNow the second part - Windows. Simply open properties of your shortcut to Thunderbird, and in path add following:\n-profile \"C:\\xxxxxxxxx\"\n\nWhere you have to add path to the previously copied profile.\nWhole path should look something like:\n\"C:\\Program Files\\Mozilla Thunderbird\\thunderbird.exe\" -profile \"C:\\xxxxxxxxxxx\"\n\n\nKeep me updated if the solution works and/or any problems occured. Good luck.\n", "Q: Dropbox no longer works under Ubuntu 13.10 I use Ubuntu 13.10 and since yesterday my Dropbox client no longer works. A reinstallation (from Software Center) did not help.

I would like to add my password as part of the script or argument.

It will ask your password on a pop-up window when you execute the script.\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nENTRY=$(zenity --password)\n\nif [ $ENTRY ]; then\n    echo -e \"$(echo $ENTRY)\" | sudo -S date\nelse\n    echo \"abort\"\nfi \nsudo ls\n\nAnd it is quite safe as it is not storing your password anywhere or allowing to display the characters while you input your password.\n", "Q: Evince printing problem I have a fresh install of Ubuntu 13.10 and have been having problems printing pdf files from evince.

I'd like to add uptime and who outputs to the MOTD, properly calling them from /etc/update-motd.d/ scripts, but it seems quite pointless if users are shown outdate information.\nFrom update-motd man page:\nExecutable  scripts  in  /etc/update-motd.d/* are executed by pam_motd(8) as\nthe root user at each login, and this information is concatenated in /var/run/motd.\nThe order of script execution is determined by the run-parts(8) --lsbsysinit option\n(basically alphabetical order, with a few caveats).\n\nIn my understanding, the MOTD should be updated on each login. But it isn't. And I don't find a script which manually updates the MOTD. I could add a run-parts line to the cron, but I don't think it's the proper way to solve this issue, as it feels like a hack or workaround.\nMy last hope was to set /etc/pam.d/login like this:\n# Prints the message of the day upon succesful login.\n# (Replaces the `MOTD_FILE' option in login.defs)\n# This includes a dynamically generated part from /run/motd.dynamic\n# and a static (admin-editable) part from /etc/motd.\n#session    optional   pam_motd.so  motd=/run/motd.dynamic noupdate\nsession    optional   pam_motd.so  motd=/run/motd.dynamic\nsession    optional   pam_motd.so\n\nI thought removing noupdate would solve the problem, but it doesn't.\n\nA: I have recently run into the same problem.  You will need to edit /etc/pam.d/sshd to remove or comment out the noupdate there as well.\n\nA: update-motd is a simple script that runs:\n   run-parts --lsbsysinit /etc/update-motd.d 2>/dev/null\n\naccording to run-parts manual:\n   If  the  --lsbsysinit  option  is given, then the names must not end in\n   .dpkg-old  or .dpkg-dist or .dpkg-new or .dpkg-tmp, and must belong  to\n   one  or more of the following namespaces: the LANANA-assigned namespace\n   (^[a-z0-9]+$);   the   LSB   hierarchical   and   reserved   namespaces\n   (^_?([a-z0-9_.]+-)+[a-z0-9]+$);  and  the  Debian cron script namespace\n   (^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$).\n\nSo, in order to verify if the problem is related to update-motd file name, try:\n   run-parts --test --lsbsysinit /etc/update-motd.d\n\nthis command prints the names of the scripts which would be run, but don't actually run them.\n", "Q: Trying to get /etc/profile working I have Ubuntu on Linode VPS.\nI intstalled latest Golang as instructed on this page (http://golang.org/doc/install) - steps taken are\n\n\n*\n\n*wget http://go.googlecode.com/files/go1.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz\n\n*tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz\n\n*Added a line \"export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin\" in \"/etc/profile\"\n\n\nAfter this, however, when I type in \"go\", I get \"program 'go' is not installed\".\nSo I did\n\"source /etc/profile\"\nAnd after that it worked.

It might have to do with the connection that one of the systems has compared to the other. I'm guessing that the desktop is connected via Ethernet and the Laptop via WiFi?

My Surface Pro insists on booting into the EFI settings menu (black screen, white text, with only the \"secure boot\" and \"tpm options) after installing 13.10 no matter what I do, and it seems like I must've tried about a hundred different things for several days straight now.\nI have waffled back and forth between restoring Windows 8 and Ubuntu on this machine, but now I am just wanting to wipe out any trace of Windows and run Ubuntu solely, and natively.  Interestingly, Ubuntu installed fine the first time around but after waffling back to Windows 8 the first time, Ubuntu will not install again or more accurately, will not boot after installing.\nI am installing Ubuntu 13.10 64-bit desktop edition from thumb bootable thumbdrive which I created using unetbootin.\nI definitely definitely have Secure Boot disabled.   I can boot to the \"live\" usb stick just fine, and the installation appears to proceed properly all the way to the point where am restarting and am prompted to remove the bootable media.\nI have gone so far as to delete all partitions from Surface's internal SSD and even to create an \"msdos\" partition table (as gparted calls it, I'm assuming is synonymous with \"mbr) just to ensure that no GPT relics remain.  The ubuntu installer seems to recreate partition table as gpt with individual partitions as it sees fit.\nHere is my boot-repair paste:  http://paste.ubuntu.com/6731471/\nIn this latest attempt, I've tried to create an encrypted main partition, but I've tried both ways a total of 20-30 times and have the same problem regardless.\nAlso, the boot-repair paste shows that \" => No boot loader is installed in the MBR of /dev/sda\" but in this latest iteration boot-repair's advanced options do not show the option to repair the boot sector or mbr.  I don't know why.  I have seen those options in the past but using them did not fix the problem.  The Surface just boots back into the EFI options black and white screen no matter what.\n\nAlso I might add that I've tried boot-repair's \"recommended repair\" about a dozen times, but to no avail.\nAny help anyone could provide is most appreciated.  Please don't send me back to Windows land!  I would much rather get Ubuntu running natively rather than within an VM.\n\nA: I just figured this out after about 4 days of solid pounding on the problem.  I had some stale boot configuration data records that were being persisted in nvram of the machine and were therefore surviving my most thorough attempts at wiping out the SSD to a clean slate.\nLots of documentation about BCD is ambiguous as to whether the data is stored in the EFI partition or in nvram on the machine.  Perhaps the storage location is machine-specific, but several times I deleted all of the partitions from this Surface's SSD AND the partition table itself, but this did not fix the issue.\nI finally reinstalled and booted into Windows 8 and tinkered around with bcdedit.exe, which is a pretty crude tool, before reading that EasyBCD has a free license for individuals.  Using it was a cinch; I just deleted all BCD records for both Windows and Ubuntu, then rebooted and ran the Ubuntu installer again and voila!!!\n", "Q: Thunar RabbitVCS - Missing Emblems I am running Desktop Ubuntu 12.04 64bit and have installed rabbitvcs-thunar (through this tutorial).

Unfortunately I can not guarantee that the system is not abused but it is rather unlikely as I freshly set up that BeagleBoard and use dedicated portforwarding on the router. The router does not forward other ports than SSH / HTTP / HTTPS and ten dedicated ports (4753 - 4762) for my Java-application.\n\nA: cron tamed, done\nI took a closer look around and found two configurations that I messed with\n\n*\n\n*/etc/cron.d/sendmail\n\n*/etc/mail/sendmail.conf\nThe first is responsible for that frequent attempt so send mail every 20 minutes or processing mail-queues every 10 minutes. I just changed two lines calling sendmail to be comments.\n#------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Every so often, give sendmail a chance to run the MSP queues.\n#\n# */20 *    *    *    *          smmsp   test -x /etc/init.d/sendmail && /usr/share/sendmail/sendmail cron-msp\n#\n#------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Every so often, give sendmail a chance to run the MTA queues.\n# Will also run MSP queues if enabled\n#\n# */10 *    *    *    *          root    test -x /etc/init.d/sendmail && /usr/share/sendmail/sendmail cron-mta\n#\n#------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe second seems to be some template the first is derived from. I changed some lines there hoping it will prevent any subsequent (automatic) reconfiguration from starting any MTA. These latter changes may turn out to be a desaster one day.\nI did some cleanup,\nrm /var/spool/mqueue/*\nrm /var/spool/mqueue-client/*\n\nrestarted cron (service cron restart) and hope that syslog will be kept clean in the future ...\n\nA: Why don't you try apt-get autoremove\nI will show you my case\n\n\n*\n\n*I've installed ssmtp\n\n*I've uninstalled ssmtp\n\n*I've installed sendmail-bin\n\n*I've uninstalled sendmail-bin\n\n*I've installed ssmtp\n\n\nAnd I got a problem like you.

In the Output result, there was an information some packages are no more necessary. And I have executed apt-get autoremove. After that /etc/cron.d/sendmail has gone and the cron mail sending stopped.\nThank you.\n\nA: There could be some reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*Your MTA is not started.\n\n*You are sending too many emails at the same time and your MTA is not able to handle it.\n\n*your mail server is being used to send out spam (to root for the looks of it, but there could be more). Stop the server, figure out how they are sending emails, remove those mails from the queue, protect your server, and then start it again.\n\n", "Q: Recent Items missing Zeitgeist I want to delete history and disable recent items recording.

Here are the three files that I've created. First, the\n  config file:\n/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-dpms.conf\n[SeatDefaults] \ndisplay-setup-script=/etc/lightdm/dpms-enable\nsession-setup-script=/etc/lightdm/dpms-disable\n\nMake sure the above is owned by root. Easiest is to create it with\n  sudoedit.\nNext are the two scripts. These need to be owned by root and made\n  executable (chmod +x).\n/etc/lightdm/dpms-enable\n#!/bin/sh\n\n(\n    # This delay is required. Might be because the X server isn't\n    # started yet.\n    sleep 10\n\n    # Set up a 5 minute timeout before powering off the display.\n    xset dpms 0 0 300 \n) &\n\n/etc/lightdm/dpms-disable\n#!/bin/sh\n\n(\n    # This delay is required. Might be because the X server isn't\n    # started yet.\n    sleep 10\n\n    # Turn off X's handling of dpms timeout. Otherwise\n    # gnome-settings-daemon and gnome-screensaver will fight over it.\n    xset dpms 0 0 0 \n) &\n\nGiven the above, I get monitor power-down at the login screen, and the\n  dpms timeouts are set to zero for a user session, so the screensaver\n  works properly.\n\n\nA: I created a file in /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/ named 50-dpms.conf.\n[SeatDefaults]\ndisplay-setup-script=/usr/local/bin/dpms-start\n\nThe dpms-start file is a script that lets user lightdm enable dpms.\n#!/bin/sh\nsudo xhost +si:localuser:lightdm # creates a user 'lightdm'\nsudo su lightdm -s /bin/bash <<HERE # lightdm starts dpms from HERE\n/usr/bin/xset +dpms\nexit\nHERE # and stops at this HERE\n\nBe sure to type sudo chmod +x /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/dpms-start to make it executable. In Ubuntu 14.04 I use this with both Unity and Cinnamon and Unity-Greeter for lock screen. I don't use Synergy for multiple displays in lightdm. Another way would be to add root to the lightdm group in /etc/group. That would eliminate the need to create the lightdm user in dpms-start.\n", "Q: Is there any application that will auto update hosts file from web? Is there any application like HostMan for Ubuntu?\nI need an application that will auto update hosts file from web.\n\nA: There are many apps, tools and solutions for this purpose in the Linux world in general and  Ubuntu in particular, some of which might suit you, while some others might look too complicated ;-)\nSo, among a number of possible answers, I would cite just one of them; hostsblock which you can find here: github.com: gaenserich/hostsblock\nIt has an easy manual installation procedure, but I've also created a deb package (which you can simply click and install) which should be in both ZIP and TAR files you can download from there. (Note: The deb file is under /pkg/ subfolder, but it contains an old version (0.12.3) of hostsblock, which is now at 0.999.x) \nIt does more or less the same job as hostsman (updating your hosts file to prevent access to \"undesirable\" sites) but it only does it in the background almost without you noticing it ever ;-)  \nUPDATE: Now there's a new DEB package including a simple GUI -app indicator- with kwak daemon as well which is available here:\nhttps://github.com/Sadi58/hostsblock/tree/master/indicator\n\n", "Q: Windows 8 not recognised when installing Ubuntu 13.10 I recently got a laptop that came pre-installed with Windows 8. I would also like to run Linux, but I do not want to remove Windows, as many of the programs I use for school are only Windows-compatible.\nI successfully booted using a USB into 'try Ubuntu', but when I went to install the only options were to overwrite Windows or 'something else' - it said no other operating system was detected.\nI did some research into partitioning, but the guides all said to back up a Windows image (or something like that) in case something went wrong. However, I don't have any way of backing up (all my USB sticks are <4GB).\nSo I have a few questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I solve the issue with Windows 8 not being recognised?

It also produced the following each time a new fps line was displayed: \n** GLX does not support GLX_EXT_swap_control or GLX_MESA_swap_control!\n** Failed to set swap interval. Results may be bounded above by refresh rate.\n\nThe Intel integrated card (no optirun - I realize this is redundant) generally produced fps figures of about 1200 on average, and produced no messages like those shown above. \nIt's not that big of a deal to get the numbers to go over 60 for the NVIDIA card, since the monitor can't do over 60fps anyways according to xrandr, but it'd just be interesting to know why those messages are produced and how that could be avoided, to see what sort of numbers the NVIDIA card can rack up compared to the Intel card. \nBut like I said it's not that big of a deal to get that figured out since bumblebee is clearly working quite nicely with the NVIDIA card, since the CPU barely even budges running through those tests with that card! That, and the quality produced for certain animations from the glmark2 test is enormously better when it runs through the discrete NVIDIA card compared to the integrated Intel card.\nThanks for any input you may have!\n\nA: Try running \nvblank_mode=0 optirun glmark2\n\nApparently there's a cap in place to limit the FPS to the refresh rate of the monitor. \n", "Q: Has the kernel panic'd when Ctrl-Alt-F1/F2/...F7 don't work anymore?

As in, which code traps Ctrl-Alt-F1/F2/...F7 and.. does something about it?\nIf Ctrl-Alt-F1/F2/...F7 don't work anymore, has the kernel panic'd and you really have to reboot? Or would ssh in from another machine still have worked (I hadn't tried - and don't know how to screw it up again..)

Thanks!\n\nA: *\n\n*is my understanding correct that Ctrl-Alt-F1/F2/...F7 is a \"kernel\" functionality ?\nyes.\n\n\nThere's an inherent race condition when switching vt's in an X window envinronment, which would hang the whole system.  \nIt's an ongoing effort to get rid of the archaic vt from kernel, specifically CONFIG_VT.\nSee David Herrmann impressive work for more details.\nReferences:\n1. How VT-switching works\n2. Sane Session-Switching\n\nA: To the first question the answer is yes. When you press Ctrl+Alt+F? you are invoking a particular virtual console. In a text console you only need to press Alt+F?, but to be consistent with the X session it will yield the same behaviour with the Ctrl+Alt+F? combination.\nWhen these key combinations stop working usually it means something when very wrong. It can be a kernel panic but also hardware failure or an hardware induced lock. The later releases of kernel 2 used to lock on Sandy Bridge architectures.\nIn essence, if you reach a state where you can't switch virtual consoles a reboot is most likely your only way out.\n", "Q: Problem with \"rhythmbox-plugin-magnatune\" I have problem with software installation on my ubuntu(12.04).

I use cron to run this every 5 hours. The problem, is that it runs every 5 hours and successfully downloads the next image but it doesn't set it as a wallpaper. Can anybody tell me what can be the problem?                \n\nA: This is happen because cron uses only a very restricted set of environment variables. The only one environment variable that is responsible for running in the right way the script from the question when this is set as a cron job is DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS.\nSo, you must to export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable in your script. See more explanations in my answer here.\nIn the end, your script should look like:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nPID=$(pgrep gnome-session)\nexport DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=$(grep -z DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS /proc/$PID/environ|cut -d= -f2-)\n\ncountervar=1;\nfinish=0;\ncd /home/guinness/.rwallpaper/\nif [ -f counter ]\nthen\n    countervar=`cat counter`\nfi\n\nfor (( i=$countervar; c<=2000000; i++ ))\ndo\n   echo $i > \"counter\"\n   if [ ! -f wallpaper-$i.jpg ]\n   then\n    wget \"http://wallpapers.wallbase.cc/rozne/wallpaper-$i.jpg\"\n\n    if [ -f wallpaper-$i.jpg ]\n    then\n        gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri \"file:///home/guinness/.rwallpaper/wallpaper-$i.jpg\"\n        exit\n    fi\n   fi\ndone\n\nA: The problem you are encountering is almost certainly that the background switching part of your script relies on environment variables from your X session. Cron doesn't set any environment variables, so this will break this part of the script.\nTo get around the issue, you can put the script into a while loop with a sleep of roughly five hours and then call place your script in a location like /etc/X11/Xsession.d/my_script or ~/.xprofile\n", "Q: Windows 8.1 repeatedly corrupts GRUB UEFI boot manager I am trying to get a dual boot Windows 8.1 / Ubuntu Precise installation.  My laptop is a Sony SVT1313Z9ES.  It seems to have a buggy UEFI implementation that always looks for EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi regardless of the configured UEFI boot manager.  I have installed Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu and have both EFI managers in my EFI filesystem.\nAfter extensive reading I have tried replacing bootmgfw.efi -- and also the bootmanager in EFI/Boot -- with the GRUB boot manager, grubx64.efi.  This works fine, until I boot Windows from GRUB.  Windows boots fine, but then after shutting down for the first time I find the bootmanager has been damaged.  It looks like Windows 8.1 has tried to replace the GRUB boot manager with its own, and failed to write it somehow.  The FAT32 filesystem that contains the EFI files is damaged.  fsck.vfat reports Free cluster summary wrong, and running md5sum on the EFI file reports Input/output error.  All other files on the EFI filesystem are undamaged, only the currently active boot manager is affected.\nFWIW, my EFI partition is a 512MB GPT partition at the very end of the disk -- but with a lot of free space, around 450MB.  Could the partition being so close to the end of the drive cause any problems?\nHow can I prevent Windows from messing up the boot manager in this way?\n\nA: This was solved by moving the backup Windows version of bootmgfw.efi, which is chainloaded by GRUB, to outside of the Microsoft/Boot subdirectory of the EFI partition.  I installed it under amoe/stock_windows_bootloader.efi and configured GRUB accordingly.  This seems to prevent the corruption, for reasons I don't really understand. \nFor anyone debugging this, I suggest also disabling Fast Startup feature in Windows, which apparently has the potential to corrupt the EFI partition.\nMany thanks to Rod Smith for his numerous helpful UEFI-related answers.\n", "Q: Keyboard shortcut for Thunar custom actions?

When using iptables, the system actually understand 'ssh' however, it's a shortcut within command line but, really, it's actually iptables INPUT -p udp -dport 22 while --dport means \"destination port\" (ssh uses port 22).

My experience with Ubuntu/Linux is limited, so please explain any solution very carefully.\n\nA: This was an annoying problem with the open source drivers, since kernel 3.11 and up things have improved a lot. There are 3 different methods to handle power management:\n\n\n*\n\n*dynpm\n\n*dpm\n\n*profiles\n\n\nThe profiles are static, you need to set them manually which is a hassle, dynpm is dynamic but causes flickering. Dpm is new since kernel 3.11 and I'm having pretty good results with it. \nTo enable it:\nOpen a terminal.\nFirst you need to set a kernel parameter, this will tell your kernel it needs to enable dpm\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nthere you need to add \"radeon.dpm=1\" to the kernel line in your grub config:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash radeon.dpm=1\"\n\nPress Ctrl-X to save, choose 'Y' to overwrite.\nNow you need to generate the new grub config:\ngrub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\nYou can use 3 profiles for dpm:\n\n\n*\n\n*battery\n\n*balanced\n\n*performance\n\n\nBalanced is the most useful one. To enable it:\nagain in the terminal:\nsudo nano /etc/rc.local\n\nadd the following line in this file ( above the line that says \"exit 0\":\necho balanced > /sys/class/drm/card0/device/power_dpm_state\n\nSave the file and reboot your pc.\n\nA: In 16.04 Xenial the problem continues, probably impacting more people since fgrlx is now deprecated.  I suffered through the summer wondering why the computer was so hot until tracking it down to this.\nThe dpm fix works, temporarily at least.  Follow boombanana's steps then enable rc.local under systemd:\nsudo systemctl enable rc-local\n\nAnother problem I had is that the setting gets restored to \"performance\" after sleep and restore.

To install ubuntu I used a live usb. I created a partition for installing ubuntu, formatted it to ext4, created another tiny partition to use it as bios code area, installed ubuntu on the partition ( the first one of course) with mount point / .\nAfter installation was successful I restarted the machine. It booted into live usb again. I installed boot repair, ran it using the recommended settings. After the repair was successful it told me not to forget to change bios boot on sda3/efi/ubuntu/shimx64.efi.\nNow I don't now exactly what that means. So I rebooted the system, went into bios, enabled secure boot and boot mode to UEFI again (opposed to legacy). But now when I boot the system after detaching the live usb, it shows a message that operating system is unavailable. I disabled secure boot and changed to legacy mode again. Now the screen get's stuck in the initial vaio logo.\nNow I think the issue was with not changing bios boot on shimx64.efi. But being this my first time with linux, I don't know what that means. Also it might be something else?I tried searching for a solution but was unable to find anything useful.I have now restored my efi files with boot repair and am able to boot into windows. \nBut couldn't get ubuntu to load anyways :( here is pastebin: paste.ubuntu.com/6732864/ \n\nA: Your first mistake was installing Linux in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. The advice to do this is being spread wide and far, but it's BAD ADVICE!!!! At best it's a necessary but temporary workaround on a handful of very buggy computers, or can be a way to simplify a Linux-only setup; but when dual-booting with Windows 8, it's more likely to create extra work, and can lead to problems like the one you're experiencing.\nWhat I recommend you do is the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Update your computer's firmware to the latest version. This sometimes fixes bugs that can contribute to the sort of problem you've got. (If you can't update because the only way to do so requires booting Windows or because an update isn't available, you'll have to skip this step.)\n\n*Using any computer that works, download and prepare a USB flash drive or CD-R with my rEFInd boot manager. (That page has download links for ready-made images for both types of media.)\n\n*Enter your firmware setup utility and ensure that:\n\n*\n\n*Secure Boot is disabled\n\n*BIOS/CSM/legacy mode is disabled (and EFI/UEFI support is enabled, if your firmware phrases it that way)\n\n\n*Boot using the rEFInd medium. It should present various options for booting both Windows and Linux. Test them all and ensure that you can boot both OSes.\n\n*If you can boot both OSes from rEFInd, install the Debian package version in Ubuntu.\n\n\nWith any luck, you'll now be able to boot both OSes via rEFInd, without using the CD-R or USB flash drive. If the firmware continues to insist that the computer isn't bootable, though, post back with details. It may be possible to work around the problem in one way or another, but if the above procedure doesn't work, you're almost certainly into bad-firmware-bug territory, which can be difficult to traverse. If the computer is new, I'd seriously consider replacing it in that case.\nEven if the above procedure works, you may end up with duplicate boot entries. Those can be dealt with in various ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use Boot Repair's Advanced options screen to undo its backup/rename operation, which causes a duplicate Windows entry, one of which boots to GRUB.\n\n*If you're sure you don't want to use a boot loader ever again, you can delete it from /boot/efi/EFI/{somename}.\n\n*If you want to unclutter an entry but keep the boot loader itself available, you can use the dont_scan_volumes, dont_scan_dirs, or dont_scan_files option in /boot/efi/EFI/refind/refind.conf to hide a partition, directory, or file.\n\n\nNote that you're likely to have at least three Linux entries: One will launch GRUB and two others will launch Linux directly. It's best to keep them all around because they can provide alternative ways of booting in case one fails in the future. The direct-boot entries each boots its own kernel, so you can choose which kernel to boot (much as you can from GRUB).\n", "Q: How to sync keepass2 using scp/ssh?

Allowed values are:\n\n           ·   1.0 - The classic CIFS/SMBv1 protocol. This is the default.\n\n           ·   2.0 - The SMBv2.002 protocol. This was initially introduced in Windows Vista Service Pack 1, and\n               Windows Server 2008.

Your problem is that you can't mount a subfolder of a smb/cifs share -- you can only mount the share itself (i.e. don't try to mount '//server/share/dir-1/dir-2/dir-3', instead mount '//server/share').

I encountered this article which includes the following suggestion:\n\nSwap and swappiness\nI kept my swap partition on the old HDD. Swap on the SSD would be\n  faster, but would also shorten the SSD’s life.\nMy system has plenty of memory, so I also reduced the swappiness value\n  to 0 to tell Ubuntu to only swap when absolutely necessary. I did this\n  by adding the line vm.swappiness=0 to /etc/sysctl.conf.\n\nIs it true that setting swappiness to zero will increase the life of my SSD? I can't find references to this elsewhere.\n\nA: All of this talk about wearing out SSDs is \"guesswork\".  I had the same feelings, but started using them commercially.  I have one of the fastest oracle clusters on the East Coast. 3 years ago, we instituted SSDs for our entire storage AND temporary file systems.  We do billions of write operations/day to the SSDs.  After 3 years, we still have not come anywhere near 10% burnout. If I can do that commercially, they will NEVER wear out in a residential situation.  So, I implemented an SSD solution specifically for swap space on my Linux workstation and BAM!\nSo, your mileage my vary, but SSD is the way to go in every way.\n\nA: Reducing the swappiness to 0 means that the OS will only start using the SSD for swap when there is no more available free RAM.\nTheoretically this can increase the SSD's lifetime because the SSD will suffer less writes. It depends whether it is practically increases the SSD's lifetime:\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux rarely use the swap  (especially compared to windows) even with higher swappiness values too, so this setting likely won't change the swapping behaviour on systems with plenty of RAM compared to RAM usage. If you are short on RAM then swapping can happen quite frequently with the default value of 60, in this case decreasing swappiness will likely have a significant impact on the SSD's write cycle limit.\n\n*The SSD's write endurance is still pretty high for a simple consumer usage, at least for MLC based SSDs. They say that the current MLC based SSD's can tolerate ca. 3000-5000 write cycles before they wore out. Calculating with the 3000 limit that means that a 128 GB SSD with a daily 10 GB writes will work happily for ca. 38000 days, that means ca. 100 years. If you have a bigger SSD of course that will wore out much later. So it is very unlikely that your SSD will die because of the cells wearing out. (Of course if you use your SSD in a corporate/server environment then the daily writes are much higher, but in corporate environments usually SLC based SSD's are used.) \n\n*This write cycle limit is so high that the SSD manufacturers (at first SAMSUNG) started to manufacture TLC based SSD's for consumers, which can only tolerate ca. 1000 write cycles, but are cheaper. These companies say that even these SSD's write cycle limit will last longer than the time the product is expected to be used. (It is unlikely that in 2024 we will be still using our 128 GB SSD's) Although if you have a TLC based SSD and you write quite frequently to that drive, e.g 50GB/day, than decreasing the swappiness value will likely have a significant effect on your SSD's life length. \n\n*Here is a giant thread where enthusiasts tested the SSD's endurance by constantly writing to them. Although their test method is probably not totally correct, their results are quite impressive and soothing. \n\n\nSo to sum up: In theory yes, decreasing the swappiness will result in longer SSD lifespan, in practice it will likely not. But if you have a TLC based SSD and you are short on RAM and you generally write frequently to the SSD then it can have a practical effect too.\nI have an MLC based, 128 GB SSD and I mostly use my system for office/browsing and I have plenty of RAM compared to my RAM usage so my SSD is not under heavy write load (although my machine is on 24/7). But because I don't need swapping at all and it is so easy to lower the swappiness I did for myself set swappiness to 0 when I installed my SSDs, because why not do it? (Actually I set swappiness to 0 on all of my machines, even on machines which only have HDDs.)\nYou can check how much write has your SSD suffered during it's life with smartctl, look for the line with Total_LBAs_Written, this will show you how much 512b sectors have been written to the SSD. (Yes I know that the SSDs have physically 4K blocks, not 512b, but SMART still says: Sector Size:      512 bytes logical/physical and with 512 blocks I get results which are comparable to the tune2fs -l Lifetime writes output.) So multiple that number with 512 and you get the writes in byte, or for short:\nsudo smartctl -a /dev/sda | grep Total_LBAs_Written | awk '{print $10*512/1024/1024/1024 \" GiB\"}'\n\nwill print out in GiBs for /dev/sda. (Just change the device name to your SSD's name.) My 128 GB SSD has suffered ca. 800 GB writes in a little more than one year, that means only 7 write cycles used from the 3000. \n\nA: Yes.  You do need to change swappiness to increase SSD life.\nSwappiness lets you control how much swap file is being used. Swappiness values can be changed from 0 to 100. The higher swappiness values the more the kernel will try to use swap space, the lower swappiness values means the kernel will use less or no swap space depending on our setting. \nThe default swappiness value from is 60, if you have plenty have RAM, you should avoid using swap space which writes and reads to your SSD, but to an HDD. For system with 4 GB or more RAM, try to reduce the usage of swap by changing swappiness settings to between 10 even 0, with the swap file being on an HDD.\nRunning a swap space is very disk I/O intensive, and that’s actually bad for an SSD. An SSD can only handle so many writes before it goes bad and you’re forced to buy another drive. So, if at all possible, move your swap space to a secondary, spinning drive…away from the SSD. \nA Solid State Drive is worn down relatively quickly by write actions. Especially the oldest generations of SSD's were vulnerable in that aspect, but to a lesser degree that's still the case for the newer generations.\nYou can either make a new partition on a new disk, or just make a swap file instead; making a new partition will almost always result in much better performance.\nIf you don’t have an alternate drive to move to, you can alter a setting that will only enable swap when your physical RAM is 100% full, which will decrease the load on your swapfile, and help your SSD. Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command(s) below:\necho 0 > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness\n\nSSD wear and tear has to do with write cycles\nA Solid State Drive is worn down relatively quickly by write actions. Especially the oldest generations of SSD's were vulnerable in that aspect, but to a lesser degree that's still the case for the newer generations.\nUse Trim\nTRIM is an advantage that you use with SSDs. It runs in software and communicates with the SSD controller, telling it which ‘blocks’ are no longer needed by the filesystem and can be safely cleaned and overwritten. This won’t really result in an improvement of performance, but will rather lengthen the life of your SSD.\nSources:Linux SSD Tweaks & How-to for optimizing your SSD\n\nA: \nIs it true that setting swappiness to zero will increase the life of my SSD?\n\nIt would cause that Linux move memory blocks less frequently to the swap partition. Writing to the swap normally uses write cycles if your swap is in the SSD. Remember that the swap is only used when needed and if you have enough RAM you may be better without it (unless you want hibernation, but that's another issue).\nThe effects of this actions may vary, but doing it just to save some write cycles in the SSD is doing it wrong. Modern SSD's (about from 2012 onwards) have tons of write cycles, and the performance might be reduced for your applications when you are almost using up all your RAM. You use more write cycles during installation of programs than due swap. Remember, again, that swap is only used when is needed by default.\nIf you are worried about your SSD write cycles used for swap you may remove/deactivate the swap altogether if you have enough RAM and only activate a temporary swap in a HDD instead of messing with the swapiness. That would be the best route.\n\nA: I would high recommend you to change swappiness setting to lower value, the best is \"0\" if you have enough memory/ram for your system 4 GB of ram or more. Even though swappiness at 10 with high ram system, i barely see ubuntu put anything on swap partition since mostly everything are on ram already.\nI did a little bit google search and i found this page http://namhuy.net/1563/how-to-tweak-and-optimize-ssd-for-ubuntu-linux-mint.html\nmight help you to tweak and optimize SSD for your Ubuntu system run more efficiently and keep your ssd live longer\n\nA: Changing swappiness may not actually have an impact.  We have played with it a lot in systems that are short on RAM and we are wanting to push as much as possible to the SSD and it has actually made little impact, the items remaining in memory (which means they are needed).  This may be a moot point. \n\nA: I liked the idea of checking the smartctl output, however, my code is a bit more compact. I have never understood why people just do not know that awk has the grep capability built into it.\nsudo smartctl -a /dev/sdb | awk ' ($0 ~ /Total_LBAs_Written/) {print ($10*512)/(1024^3) \" GiB\"}'\n\nThough this is the code I use:\nsudo smartctl -a ${device} | awk ' ($0 ~ /Total_LBAs_Written/) { if (($10*512)/(1024^3) > 1000) { msg=\"TiB\"; size=($10*512)/(1024^4); } else { msg=\"GiB\"; size=($10*512)/(1024^3); }; printf \"\\nThis device has had %.2\nf %s written to it.\\n\",size,msg; }'\n\n", "Q: MAAS “blocked for more than 120 seconds” error when provisioning a node I created a MAAS server and a node.

Assuming that is the case, it will not run when you are running Ubuntu, and there is little to nothing you can do about that.\nThat page doesn't explicitly say the software is Windows-only. But I downloaded the free trial, which is Windows only. Nowhere (that I can see) does it say it supports any other operating system than Windows. And I've never heard of a program like BitDefender Total Security supporting Ubuntu.\nSome Windows programs can be run on Ubuntu with Wine. Firewalls cannot. The active monitoring antivirus part of the software will also not work. Manual virus scanning will probably not work either, but you could try.\nA good general rule for what you can and cannot do with Wine, which is usually correct, is that anything that changes the way your Ubuntu system works for anything besides Windows programs, will not work on Wine. Generally speaking it is not possible for any program running with Wine to restrict or extend the functioning of programs and services that are running on Ubuntu but not through Wine. Wine cannot (ever) be used to install and run Windows device drivers. It cannot be used to modify the operation of Ubuntu's network stack for Ubuntu programs. All these things are things that BitDefender Total Security must do, for even its most basic operation.\n(These \"rules\" about what can and cannot be done with Wine are not actually security restrictions. Programs running in Wine can open files outside your Wine folder, for example. You should certainly not install untrusted Windows programs on Ubuntu with Wine anymore than it would be a good idea to do so on a real Windows system. It's just that, running a program on Wine doesn't make the rest of Ubuntu act like Windows.)\nGood News: You Don't Need It\nThe good news is, you probably do not need this software in Ubuntu.\n\n\n*\n\n*Firewalls to block incoming connections are often completely unnecessary when your operating system doesn't run unnecessary servers and make them unnecessarily open to access from the outside. Firewalls to prevent programs from \"calling out\" are rarely more than an inconvenience to you, when your operating system gives you effective means of installing and using only software you trust (and when there's far less malware for your OS, see below).\n\n*If you want to use a firewall in Ubuntu, there's one built in which you can configure.\n\n*Currently there is little to no malware in the wild that exploits Ubuntu. You should not install or run software you don't trust, but that's true on any OS and regardless of what security software is installed. Note that I am not saying that there are no significant security risks to Ubuntu users. For example, you are still about equally at risk of browser XSS exploits as users of Windows or OS X (or other GNU/Linux systems).

Why can't I pipe stuff into cd?\nExample: \n$ pwd >> ~/mloc\n$ cd /\n$ tail -n 1 ~/mloc | cd\n\ncd fails. If do: cd $(tail -n 1 ~/mloc), it works.\nI understand the last command I wrote works, but I don't understand why I can't pipe into cd.\n\nA: Piping to a process sends data to it in place of what you'd type after you have launched the process, not what you'd type as part of the command that launches the process.\n(cd is also not a process but that's less important, I address it below.)\nPiping attaches one command's output to another command's input. Consider:\nfoo | bar\n\nThat runs bar, runs foo, and:\n\n*\n\n*instead of showing foo's output on the terminal, it directs it to bar as input.\n\n*instead of taking input to bar from the terminal, it takes it from foo's output.\n\n(Both those bullet points actually express the same thing.)\nSo, what happens when you run tail -n 1 ~/mloc | cd?\n\n*\n\n*It runs cd and, whenever cd accepts input while running, it takes that input from the output of tail -n 1 ~/mloc.\n\n*cd never accepts input while running.\n\nSee standard streams (Wikipedia) for more information on the precise meaning of input and output in this answer. (Here, by input, I mean \"standard input\" and by output I mean \"standard output.\")\nThere is also the issue that cd is not actually a program, but a shell builtin, so when you run cd no new process is launched. But that is not really why what you're trying doesn't work, because:\n\n*\n\n*Using pipes to pass command line arguments, as you've been attempting, will not ever work for any program.\n\n\n*There's no reason a shell couldn't be written to accommodate pipes to a shell builtin, considering that they accommodate pipes from shell builtins.\nNote that sometimes when you use a shell builtin like it's a real program, what happens is that the real program of the same name is run instead. But there's no separate program for cd, and we can pipe from cd; for example, run cd blah 2>&1 | less; if blah doesn't exist or isn't a directory, you'll be able to view the error in less.\nFinally, consider what's different about cd $(tail -n 1 ~/mloc). This command:\n\n*\n\n*Runs tail -n 1 ~/mloc and captures its output.\n\n*Instead of displaying the output, constructs a command consisting of it appended to cd .\n\n*Runs that command.\n\n\nA: The short answer is: cd doesn't work like that.\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#index-cd\nThe longer answer is that in bash, commands in a pipeline are each executed in a subshell. Since cd is a shell builtin, it only affects the shell it's executed in. If you cd within a subshell, the effect will disappear when the subshell exits.\n", "Q: Display contents of one folder in another Is it possible to show all the files from one folder in another on Ubuntu?

Running sudo /etc/init.d/zfs-share restart works too. Also, the mountall program in 16.04 does not support zfs, for whatever reason.\nI think the problem is that when you set sharesmb=on, it creates a share name based on poolname/sharename like so: poolname_sharename\nBut it seems that this share name can be too long. I've read that you should limit netbios names to 14 characters or less, and also limit the number of characters in the Comments field too.\nSo, I created a new filesystem with a combined length of less than 14 characters, including the underscore:\nsudo zfs create -o casesensitivity=mixed -o nbmand=on pool/share\n\nThen edit /etc/default/zfs, and disable smb mounting/sharing: (I think one is for NFS, but I disable it all)\nZFS_MOUNT='no'\nZFS_UNMOUNT='no'\nZFS_SHARE='no'\nZFS_UNSHARE='no'\n\nFinally, enable sharesmb for the new filesystem:\nsudo zfs set sharesmb=on pool/share\n\nI also made sure the /ect/hostid file exists. (google how to create one)\nNow when I reboot, I run this command without having to do anything else, and my share appears:\nsmbclient -U guest -N -L localhost  (or use smbclient -L localhost)\n\n\nSharename       Type      Comment\n---------       ----      -------\nprint$          Disk      Printer Drivers\nIPC$            IPC       IPC Service (my server (Samba, Ubuntu))\npool_share      Disk      Comment: /pool/share\n\nAnd yes, I know that samba supports names longer than 14 characters, but it seems to screw up mounting zfs shares at boot. \nI'd love to know if this works for anyone else, or if its just some quirk on my system...\n\nA: I had the same problem on a clean install on 16.04 LTS. \nAfter a restart, no pools were present (zpool status showed no pools), but a zpool import <poolName> would restore my pool.\nTurned out to be fixed by the answers to ZFS Pools not mounted 16.04. Reproducing the working answer here:\nsudo apt remove zfs.doc\nsudo apt install zfsutils-linux\n\nThis \n\nA: You need to edit the file /etc/default/zfs with your favourite editor, eg: nano, vim or something else, and change the lines\nZFS_MOUNT='no'\nZFS_UNMOUNT='no'\n\nto\nZFS_MOUNT='yes'\nZFS_UNMOUNT='yes'\n\nThe other option is to install mountall (apt-get install mountall) from the ZFS Stable PPA, it takes care of that for you. The first option is preferable and faster.\n\nA: I've found that even with mountall it just doesn't work right sometimes. I literally built two identical servers, placed identical model HDs in each one and installed Ubuntu and the ZFS PPA at the same time from the same sources. One would automount, the other wouldn't.  Even following the extra FAQ instructions about adding a sleep in the mountall.conf file, etc., it never would mount at boot. I ended up putting a mountall command in /etc/rc.local. \n\nA: 04\nMy zfs was not mounting\nI did a:\nsudo zfs import \nIt listed all my unmounted pools but it also gave me a option to mount by\nzfs name or number\nI did the import by it's number \nsudo zfs import ##############\nand now it auto mounts after every reboot\nIt looks like that number is the uuid of the array and all the drives in the array have the same number\nHope that helps\n\nA: Ubuntu 20.04 here. I had problems about mount ordering. I got it working by following the instructions here:\nhttps://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/Getting%20Started/Ubuntu/Ubuntu%2020.04%20Root%20on%20ZFS.html\n\n\n*Filesystem mount ordering\n\nmkdir /etc/zfs/zfs-list.cache\ntouch /etc/zfs/zfs-list.cache/mypool\nln -s /usr/lib/zfs-linux/zed.d/history_event-zfs-list-cacher.sh /etc/zfs/zed.d\n\nzfs set canmount=on mypool\n\nAfter reboot the mount order is correct and I can bind mount directories from the ZFS volume.\n\nA: In my case, the problem was that zfs would not import the cached pool on boot with the uuid. In my case, I originally created the pool as follows using the uuid:\nzpool create -m /Backups Backups -f /dev/disk/by-uuid/c529a4ef-3c6a-4eb6-8d60-bc46785266cb\nNoticing it would not import at boot and after searching forums and tinkering with configs to no avail, I attempting to export it and import it back in with id instead of uuid as follows:\nzpool export Backups \nzpool import -d /dev/disk/by-id Backups\nAfter rebooting, it imported the cached pool without issue. I'm not sure why it malfunctions with uuid as opposed to id, merely reporting the fix if others come by here looking for a solution.\n", "Q: How do I find the package name for an application that I want to uninstall?

I have an Ubuntu laptop I use as a plex server, seedbox, DNS cache and ad filter for my home network. Since it's the only computer in the house that doesn't get shutdown, I have a tendency to load random stuff onto it just to have a play. This results in it needing to be formatted and reinstalled every now and then (because sometimes I manage to break things pretty damn bad).\nI'd like to be able to keep my customised stuff somewhere (I have three external drives attached to the laptop) so that I can format the laptop's internal drive and reinstall Ubuntu, and then just run a script or mount a directory to have the things I want to reappear.\nIf I could simply store the config files for Transmission, Apache2 and Plex (etc) on an external drive and overlay them on the appropriate directories, that'd be perfect. I've looked at overlayfs but I'm not sure if that's the best solution because I don't want to overlay an entire filesystem (any apt-get upgrades would be stored on the external drive, right?), and I'd like to be able to browse the config files on my external drive without having to mount a squashfs or something.\n\nA: I suggest you run LXC - containers. Within a few minutes, you can create a new \"virtual machine\" (not entirely virtual, but virtual enough for this sort of thing). You can install all your testy stuff inside this container, it behaves like it's another computer. Then, later, you can delete the container, and it won't have any effect on anything else. You can make as many containers as you like, with very little overhead.\nCheck out https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/lxc.html for more about Linux Containers.\n\nA: Where is the fun when you learn how to break things, but not how to efficiently setup, backup and repair? Besides, such kind of question reminds me of the law of the instrument.\nThe other option: Avoiding re-installations where possible\nUse dedicated partitions/filesystems like a home partition\nYou can have persistent files in your home directory by just using a different partition for /home in /etc/fstab. You don't need to re-install to configure this.\nAdditionally instead of mounting an overlayfs accross your entire installation, you could mount one or more to the directories where you need them, this should be possible.\nDo backups\nEven if it's just your testing machine. You wouldn't go through the time and bandwidth consuming process of re-installation and configuration, if you already knew how to get back to the state before the issue occurred that broke presumably everything. (To break it again and again and eventually learn what broke and how to fix.) Installing the same operating system will not teach you knew things nor will it ever fix the cause of an issue, you just click buttons faster.\nLearning how to create, restore and verify backups on the other hand will save you time, money and stress on all your computers.\nNew things to learn\nPlease take a look at Comparison of backup tools. You could also use a filesystem with snapshot functionality like btrfs, which is similar to an overlay filesystem, but not a replacement for proper backups.\nYou should also learn about package-management (how to get back to default package configuration), cron-jobs and git (to document changes to config files for yourself, when you try things out).\n", "Q: Cannot write bytes: Broken pipe I uninstalled 11.04 and installed 12.04 and grub was not detecting the partitions, so I fixed it with boot-repair and 12.04 loaded perfectly, then I tried to install the device driver for Nvidia Graphics card and it took a long time, so I stopped it and shut down.When I restarted the computer I got the message cannot write bytes: broken pipe.Then I followed this thread for help.\ncould not write bytes broken pipe 12.04\nI went to recovery mode and drooping to root prompt and typed this command\nsudo gedit /var/log/apt/history.log\n\nFor this I got the following error message as gedit did not open that file:\n(gedit : 856):Warning : Command line 'dbus-launch --autolaunch=somernadomnumbers --\nbinary-syntax --close-stderr' exitted with non-zero exit \nstatus 1: Autolaunch error: X11 initialization failed. \\n\ncannot open display:\nRun 'gedit --help' to see a full list of available command options.\n\nDid this happen because of stopping the installation of Nvidia device driver in the middle of its installation?\nI am running 12.04 with Winodws 7 dual boot.Any help would be appreciated.\nWhen 12.04 was working normally I started and quit in the middle of the installation of the Grahpics driver for Nvidia Grahpics card and I restarted the computer and got the could not write bytes: broken pipe error.\n\nA: A quick fix: boot in recovery mode with networking and issue sudo apt-get install --reinstall xserver-xorg, then reboot.\n", "Q: File \"/usr/lib/update-notifier/package-data-downloader\", line 29, in  import debconf So, I'm trying to install the Flash player plugin, but it says update-notifier-common is not configured.

But after one successful login it never asks for authentication again. I want it to ask for authentication everytime.\n\nA: There are two things which you may be referring to here:\nIf you want to run one single command as root, run sudo <command>. Once that command finishes, you will lose root privileges. for example, you might run sudo whoami - the whoami command shows who you are logged in as. sudo whoami should show you are root, and when whoami is done, you will lose root privileges.\nsu, however, runs bash (or an equivalent shell). bash will then ask you, as root, what commands you want to run. To exit su and bash, just type exit; you will lose your privileges, and return to normal.\nThe other possibility is that sudo may be caching your authentication. This normally lasts 5 minutes from when you typed in your password, or when you run sudo -k. Or, you can disable this entirely by adding the following line to the file /etc/sudoers: timestamp_timeout=0\n\nA: sudo su command allows you to login into root account.After successful login it don't asks for authentication again.\nIf you want authentication for everytime then you have to exit out of the root account by running exit command.\n\nA: While using \"sudo\" command, u will be asked for a password. Once a user has been authenticated, a timestamp is updated and the user may then use sudo without a password for a short period of time (possibly 5 mins). so it will ask password after that time expires.\n", "Q: Editing file in Ubuntu One I have uploaded a file to ubuntu one.

When using logrotate to keep log files rotating, I have seen\npostrotate\n                invoke-rc.d rsyslog rotate > /dev/null\nendscript\n\nI know postrotate makes bash execute the following command after the log file is rotated, but what is the purpose of this command being executed exactly? \nFinally, is it now outdated? (I seem to seeing a message from anacron saying \"The script you are attempting to invoke has been converted to an Upstart\njob, but rotate is not supported for Upstart jobs.\")\n\nA: I had a similar issue, and it seems like the rsyslog configuration for logrotate is broken, so instead of calling service rsyslog rotate which actually works, it uses reload rsyslog or similar. Turns out this was actually a bug, which has been fixed in version 7.4.4-1ubuntu5, but my installation of Ubuntu 14.04 only sees version 7.4.4-1ubuntu2 in apt.\nThis is the fix that worked for me:\nEdit the file /etc/logrotate.d/rsyslog, replacing the line inside the postrotate block (e.g. reload rsyslog or invoke-rc.d rsyslog rotate) with this:\nservice rsyslog rotate >/dev/null 2>&1 || true\n\nThis is what the block should look like:\npostrotate\n    service rsyslog rotate >/dev/null 2>&1 || true\nendscript\n\nWith all the surrounding lines kept as they are.\nAs a last step, it might be a good idea to run the command manually once:\nservice rsyslog rotate\n\n\nA: The purpose of the command is forcing rsyslog to reopen the files it's using to write logs. It's used after logrotate moves the old files, so rsyslog starts writing to the new ones.\nExample: rsyslog writes most of its stuff to /var/log/syslog. When logrotate kicks in, it moves this file to /var/log/syslog.1 and creates a new, empty /var/log/syslog. But as you probably know (but just in case), rsyslog is not writing to a file named /var/log/syslog, but to a file descriptor it got the first time it opened the file. You can move around the file associated and rsyslog would keep writing to it, because it only knows about the file descriptor. When you move /var/log/syslog to /var/log/syslog.1, rsyslog will keep writing to /var/log/syslog.1, because that's what its file descriptor points to. In fact, you could even delete the file and rsyslog would keep writing. That's what happens when files that are deleted seem to be occupying space: the file descriptors are still opened, and thus the space is not freed. This only happens when the last reference to the file is closed.\nThe \"rotate\" argument is meant to force the release of old file descriptors, and to tell rsyslog that it must open the files again, so it gets new file descriptors to the new files and the old ones can be properly disposed of.\nAs to it being outdated, I'm afraid I don't know. That's what took me to your question O:-) But I believe the problem is that the upstart config is not ready to accept this option. I've replaced it with this, from the man page:\nkill -HUP $(cat /var/run/rsyslogd.pid)\n\nWhich is what \"rotate\" did, anyway. Hope that helps.\n", "Q: How to add / list / remove a group How can I add a new group (for file permission)?\nHow can I view the full list of existing groups?\nHow can I remove a group?\nI prefer to do the above using a UI rather than terminal commands if possible.\nI am using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on VirtualBox.\n\nA: Which group do you belong to:\n\ngroups\n\nAll existing groups are in the file /etc/group.

So one could replace a corrupt .bashrc simply by overwitting from there.\nCaution:  if you replace the .bashrc file with a fresh one, it will remove any other modification(s) you have made to it. For example, one could add aliases, custom function or PATH in .bashrc. When you replace the file, all those modifications will be lost. Better you can keep a copy of your modified .bashrc before replacing it. Later, you can carefully extract the required part from it. To keep a backup copy of your modified .bashrc in your home directory with name my_bashrc use the following in a terminal,\n/bin/cp ~/.bashrc ~/my_bashrc\n\nWhy /bin/cp: In case if you have messed with your $PATH variable when changed ~/.bashrc all the executable will be unavailable from your terminal and cp will not work anymore. So it is recommended to call cp with its full path as /bin/cp while you are trying to copy something with corrupt ~/.bashrc.\nFinally, use the following command in your terminal to replace the ~/.bashrc with a fresh copy,\n/bin/cp /etc/skel/.bashrc ~/\n\nIt will replace your corrupt ~/.bashrc with a fresh one. After that, you need to source the ~/.bashrc so that the change takes place immediately, write in the terminal,\n. ~/.bashrc\n\nor,\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nor, if that does not work you can close the terminal and open it again.\n\nA: If you can't get a working shell\nVia the file browser\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the file browser, go to the home directory, press CtrlH so that hidden files are shown.

Use the working shell as needed.\n\n*Delete the custom profile, or uncheck the custom command option if you edited the default profile, once you're done.\n\n\nIf you have SSH\nRun SSH with a custom command, which should help you bypass the .bashrc:\nssh -t <host> dash\n\nThe dash shell (aka /bin/sh) is minimal, but sufficient for restoring the .bashrc.\nIf you can't get a GUI and don't have SSH\nBoot into recovery mode (How do I boot into recovery mode?), which will get you a root shell.

I'm buying an HP Microserver with 4x 2TB, and I currently have two computers. I'd like this microserver to become my \"databank\" in many respects:\n\n\n*\n\n*I want to configure my computers so they can automatically backup to this box using the Ubuntu utility (Deja-Dup).\n\n*I want to install a Git server, a local dropbox and a media server (from what I know, either Plex, xbmc or this post, or any good suggestion)\n\n*Ideally, and because of the little I know about it, I'd like my filesystem to be ZFS and I also need help for configuring my zpool in the most efficient way.\n\n\nAbout ZFS\nI want my filesystem to be fast in reading, very reliable and to support a single disk crash, but I don't require it to be fast in writing. There are four disks, all 2TB - 7200rpm - 64MB cache. I want to make the most of them, in that respect for instance, plain mirroring doesn't seem to be the way to go. But I have no previous experience with ZFS, hence my request for help. I'm thinking of installing Ubuntu Server 12.04 as my operating system, and use ubuntu-zfs.\n\n\n*\n\n*How should I configure my zpool to make the most of my four 2TB HDDs?\nMany many thanks in advance, J\n\nA: Create a striped mirrored zpool (effectively RAID10). If you're on a budget you can also get away with a raidz (effectively RAID5, but safer due to zfs checksums).\nZFS likes lots of RAM so be sure to fill up your server. With four disks you should easily saturate a 1Gbps LAN (sequential reads) and with only two computers on your network your read performance should be fine, but you can also consider getting an SSD for L2ARC (read caching)\n\nA: To make the most of your 4x 2TB disks, and be able to survive a single drive failure, the obvious choice would be a pool with the 4 drives set up as a single RAIDZ VDEV. RAIDZ is essentially an advanced version of RAID-5, so you loose 1 drive 's worth of capacity to parity, which can be used to recover from losing any one drive in the array. RAIDZ provides quite decent read performance, especially on sequential reads, but write speed and random IO is not very impressive.\n", "Q: Netflix Composting Support I receive this message when trying to open Netflix Desktop.\nCompositing is not available, please enable compositing support and relaunch Netflix Desktop.\nHow do I enable compositing support for Netflix?\n\nA: This is a common error that indicates you did not install a driver that supports it:\nFrom a bugreport on netflix:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the power/config menu in the upper right and choose \"System Settings\".\n\n*Open \"Additional Drivers\"\n\n*Choose the most up-to-date proprietary driver it lists that is not labeled \"experimental\"\n\n*Click \"Activate\"\n\n*Wait for it to download and activate the driver\n\n*Try again.

Then you can use smbclient to connect to the server and there you can use lsand cd. Connect with something like smbclient //192.168.2.10/Volume1 .\nDoes it use ftp? Then you can use ftp to connect to the server and use cd and ls again. Connect with something like: ftp 192.168.2.10 .\nDoes it use sftp? Then you can use sftp to connect to the server and use cd and ls again. Connect with something like: sftp user@192.168.2.10 .\nAnd so on. So generally you don't need it to be mounted, because usually you can access the files with a client.\n\nI expand the samba version, because you have that kind of share:\n\n\n*\n\n*You need the ip of the NAS, e.g 192.168.2.10, then you type in a terminal:\nsmbclient -L=192.168.2.10\n\nThe server will ask for a password but because you said it is a public share you don't need one, just press ENTER. Now you are presented with the shares services on the server, e.g.:\nDomain=[WORKGROUP] OS=[Unix] Server=[Samba 3.0.14a]\n\nSharename       Type      Comment\n---------       ----      -------\nVolume1         Disk      \nIPC$            IPC       IPC Service ()\nADMIN$          IPC       IPC Service ()\n\nAs you see I have only one Disk share named Volume1.\n\n*Now you type in\nsmbclient //192.168.2.10/Volume1\n\nor\nsmbclient \\\\\\\\192.168.2.10\\\\Volume1\n\nto access the Volume1 share on the server with ip 192.168.2.10. The server again asks for a password, just press ENTER.\n\n*Now you are in the client and can browse the shared volume without mounting it to your file system.  You can type help to get the available commands, but if you are familiar with ftp than it is basically the same. You can use ls to list the directory contents, or cd to change directory. You can exit from the client with quit.\nUsing this way the share is not mounted to your file system, only the client communicates with the server. (I think this was your question.)\n\nA: Stumbled on this old thread and realized it is Wrong. Ubuntu 17.04, open up the file system explorer, navigate to the network directory, right-click, select \"Open in Terminal\". It works well.\n\nA: You definitely need to have the shares mounted onto the filesystem for any tool that work with it to see them.\nYou cannot ls a URI, nor cd into one.\n", "Q: Cannot connect Logitech 810 keboard on 13.10 I have a Logitech 810 bluetooth key board that I was able to pair when I was running Ubuntu 12.04LTS.

A laptop that had a special discount because it was associated with the school or something. Anyways.\nIt came with 2 OS: Windows 7 and Linux Magic Box (translation of \"Linux Caixa Mágica\", something that was supposed to help learning but it sucks). I then installed Ubuntu in what I thought that it was a 103GB partition, but upon further investigation I think I actually only gave it 7GB! It was exactly the other way around I wanted.\nSo, on the boot screen (where I can choose the 3 different OS) it showed 2 different parts for the Linux Magic Box: \"/dev/sda2\" and /dev/sda5. I tried to delete the /dev/sda 5, but is says that it has to delete the logical ones higher than 5... or something along those lines. I can post the full error message if needed :) The /dev/sda2 deleted without any problems.\nHere is my GParted screen:\n\nAs you can see, there is indeed some more space left for allocating. But there are tons of different partitions! I wanted to delete almost all of them, but I'm afraid I might screw up.\nThis is what shows up in Windows 7 Computer (please never mind the text being in Portuguese, I think it's understandable)\n\nAs you can see, I have 2 discs: /c/ and /d/. So it should be 2 partitions, correct? I really don't understand it.\nMy idea is to keep Windows 7 installed, and Ubuntu installed alongside them as well, removing only the Magic Box, this releasing more space for Ubuntu. But what seems like a simple task actually turned not to be quite so.\nMany thanks in advance!\n\nA: Windows doesn't understand linux partitions, so it doesn't show them in the file manager. If you open windows's partition manager (which I forgot how to access) you will see all the partitions.\nYou have 3 primary partitions: /dev/sda1, /dev/sda3, /dev/sda4\n/dev/sda4 is an extended partition, it is divided up into 4 logical partitions: /dev/sda5, /dev/sda6, /dev/sda7 and /dev/sda8. \nYou just have to resize those partitions with gparted and take the unallocated space. E.g make /dev/sda8 bigger by extending it to the left until /dev/sda6. \nYou can also delete any partition, but as your error message said, you have to first unmount the partitions which have a higher logical number. That means that while /dev/sda8 is mounted you can't delete /dev/sda5. The easiest thing when you have to manipulate the partitions is to just boot up a live CD and start gparted there and do your job, because in a live session none of your partitions on the HDD are mounted.\n\nA: Ok 1st some basic stuff. In linux devices are shown as:\n/dev/sdXN \n\n\n\n*\n\n*... where X is a disc starting from a=1st disc, b=2nd disc.\n\n*... where N is a partition. 1=1st partition, 2=2nd partition\n\n\nWindows insists on having its boot always on the 1st partition.\nSo\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda1 is your C: drive.\n\n*That disc has unallocated space of 48 Gb. More than enough for a Linux/Ubuntu install but I would advice to format it in Windows and either add it to C: or create an E:. \n\n*/dev/sda3 seems to be a pre-installed diagnostics (probably a partition that is used for a re-install of your Windows. If you create a installation DVD you can remove this. If you delete it do that 1st and add it to the new E: drive or C: drive (you can use gParted for it but also Windows itself or a tool like Partition Magic.\n\n*/dev/sda4 is your D: drive.\n\n*/dev/sda5, sda7 and sda8 are Linux (ext is the default filesystem of Linux). sda8 is swap. The other 2 are weird: I would expect to see a label /. 1 is probably Ubuntu and 1  Linux Magic Box.\n\n\nIf I was you I would move the contents of /dev/sda5 (the FAT32) to your C: or D: drive.  It is then possible to remove ALL of the partitons named sda4 up to sda8 and create 2 or 3 new partions (1 for swap (2-5Gb should do), 1 for root (/; 15Gb should do) and 1 for your data (this is the equivalent of your D: drive for Ubuntu).\nThe result would be a clean install of Ubuntu with root on sda5, swap on sda6 and a data partition on sda7. \nYou can do all of this from the installer and if you do decide to format make them all ext4 and not ext4 or ext2.\nIf you want to KEEP any data on the Ubuntu disc you can also install gParted and make sda8 larger by adding the unallocated space between sda8 and sda8. It is a bit more complex though. The easiest method is to make a gParted Live CD; it works the same as Ubuntu Live DVD but that one is solely for disc management. \nThere is no need for an extra FAT32 partitions: Ubuntu will happily mount C: and D: for you so you can put files on D: and see them from Ubuntu. \n\nA: With Linux structure, a small portion of hard drive is being used for booting up only. After the OS is being loaded and sync-ed with kernel (BIOS of your motherboard), it'll then mount your main partition where / and /home/yourusername is located.\ntypical structure that is common among Ubuntuians:\nsda1 master disk (where your GRUB resides) - classified as \"primary partition\"\nsda2 as extended partition. you will never see that partition because it is a \"box\" that hold \"boxes\" such as your sda5 - thus classified as \"extended partition\".\nsda5 as logical partition where all of your main directory resides in. (i.e. / or /home/yourusername or such).\nThese structures are what enable Linux to operate. So, these files above are what control and assist in swapping and mounting these partitions so that way your OS can be loaded.\n\nA: I suggest keep Windows partition sda1, swap sda7, Ubuntu partition sda8 (probably, according to your Q) [and diagnostics sda3, if you want to!].\nThe steps:\n\n*\n\n*Backup the desired contents of sda6,\n\n\n*Boot Live-Ubuntu and start GParted,\n\n\n*Right click the swap partition sda7 and turn swap off,\n\n\n*Among the logical partitions, delete sda5 and sda6 so that you have around 112GB of unallocated space in the extended partition. Use this to expand your sda8 partition (recommended) or create a new logical partition; or somewhere in between.\n\n\n*Keep sda3 if you want to, else delete and create a primary partition with the unallocated space succeeding sda1.\n\n\n*Go to Edit menu and select apply the pending operations.\n\n", "Q: Thunderbird Google calendar tab acts as mobile browser I am using Thunderbird with the add-on Google Calendar Tab to display a browser tab with Google calendar.

But computer still can't hibernate.\n\nA: In simple terms, 'swap space' is used when your computer decides that you don't need these files right now, but they should be easily accessible (it may seem strange but accessing files from the hard drive is very very slow in computer terms).\nI just recently installed Ubuntu and was given the warning that it's highly recommended to reserve some swap space on the hard drive. The post linked by minerz029 has fairly simple instructions for creating a file that's used as swap space. However, if it's reasonable for you to overwrite your existing Ubuntu install, it may be easier to do that and in the process create a partition for use as swap space.\n", "Q: Cannot access GNU GRUB I accidentally changed my GRUB options to boot from memtest instead of the correct linux kernel.

I've wiped out the old partitions and installed this fresh. Running the \"Try Ubuntu\" works fine (I'm using it right now.) The installation seems to go fine (I've done it twice now). But when I reboot the system to Ubuntu I get an error message:\n\"Gave up waiting for root device. ...\"\nEventually I get this line:\n\"ALERT! /dev/disk/by-uuid/234...89d72 does not exist.\" (the ... is the whole UUID which I will not utter here.)\nI've installed Ubuntu several times on various laptops and never had a problem. Any ideas as to what this might be would be appreciated.\n\nA: So I finally figured out what this was. The there was a \"large\" drive on the system that the Windows OS had \"lost track of\" - i.e. couldn't access - but Windows still booted fine - i.e. it wasn't the boot device.\nHowever, Ubuntu seemed to recognize that the device was there and just insisted that it if couldn't talk to it then it wasn't going to boot. \nSo the answer was to simply unplug the SATA cable that connected it to the motherboard and, hey presto! Ubuntu couldn't see the drive at all and seems to boot just fine.\nIf I was calling the shots I'd call this a bug - at least it is unexpected behavior. Flag an error in big letters? Fine.

Why does it change the line under Status from *enabled to *disabled or vice versa?  \nThank you!  Why doesn't it just append the word EHC1 to the end?\n\nA: Like the other files at /proc/ the file /proc/acpi/wakeup is not a real file but an interface to some kernel functions.\nIf you write something into it, the value you wrote isn't stored in a file but a kernel functions is called and does something with the value.\nIf you read from it another kernel function is called that creates some output that appears as the content of that file.\n", "Q: Wireless adapter connects every time I insert it, but stops working after a short while The model is Edimax EW-7811UN 150Mbps Wireless Nano USB Adapter. \nIt doesn't work for more than a few minutes, but if I take it out and let it cool then insert it again, it works.\n\nA: I was having the same problem with a Dell D1450U USB wireless card.

There is updated information in this bug report:\nhttps://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?41061\n\nA: i installed the 3.8 octave version following this instruction - works great. there is a quite long list of dependencies packages which is also instilled if you follow the instructions.\nhttp://blogs.bu.edu/mhirsch/2013/12/compiling-octave-3-8/\ncheers\nseeb\n\nA: \nApparently, you didn't install important libraries along with Octave as I glanced the error message. My suggestion goes with Installing Octave properly from ubuntu software center, then it will automatically detect which library is missing from your system, thus adding it and installing it along with Octave. If you don't know how to install from ubuntu software center just tell me , I can instruct you step by step. \nThank you\n\nA: llvm is used by the optional jit. The jit makes octave perform better but it is not strictly necessary. To prevent the octave build from looking for llvm, use the --disable-jit flag like so:\n./configure --disable-jit\nmake\nsudo make install\n\n", "Q: Simulate Enter Press in a Screen I have successfully run command\nscreen -S Run -X stuff 'stop'`echo -ne '\\015'` \n\nin the terminal and had screen Run receive the stop command and then receive the simulated enter press.

With this DVD I have already installed Ubuntu 13.10 on another laptop ( about a month ago ) on which no errors have occurred ( so far ).\nHowever on this laptop I seem to have a problem with bluetooth. Every time I try to turn it off in settings menu, it turns itself back on. It's quite annoying...\nComputer software is up-to-date ( no update fixed this )..,\nAnyone has a clue with this issue?\n\nA: Here is a workaround for the opposite situation (turn bluetooth on and it turns iself back off), may it'll work for you... Open a terminal and type \"rfkill list all\":\n\n$ rfkill list all\n0: hci0: Bluetooth\nSoft blocked: yes\nHard blocked: no \n\nIf you see the same output (\"Soft blocked: yes\"), just type \"sudo rfkill unblock all\":\n\n$ sudo rfkill unblock all\n0: hci0: Bluetooth\nSoft blocked: no\nHard blocked: no \n\nWorked for me, bluetooth's indicator appears in the panel again and bluetooth is activated.\nYou could use \"rfkill\" for enabling and disabling the wireless devices. You can list all the wireless devices with indexes using the \"rfkill list\" command. For example:\n\n$ rfkill list\n0: hci0: Bluetooth\n     Soft blocked: no\n     Hard blocked: no\n1: sony-wifi: Wireless LAN\n     Soft blocked: no\n     Hard blocked: no\n2: sony-bluetooth: Bluetooth\n     Soft blocked: no\n     Hard blocked: no\n3: phy0: Wireless LAN\n     Soft blocked: no\n     Hard blocked: no\n\nIn this case, there are four devices with indexes 0, 1, 2 and 3. The rfkill block and unblock commands are \"rfkill block index|type\" and \"rfkill unblock index|type\". The block command disables the indicated device whereas the unblock command enables it. A device is identified by the device index or the device type. The device type is one of the following: all, wifi, wlan, bluetooth, uwb, ultrawideband, wimax, wwan, gps or fm. \nFollowing with the example, by typing:\n\nrfkill block 0\n\nSomeone could turn off the bluetooth device recognized as \"hci0: Bluetooth\" with index \"0\".\n", "Q: Ubuntu 13.10 Login Credentials Again I was using my laptop which runs Ubuntu 13.10 and wanted to switch workspaces. I'm not exactly sure which keys I pressed, but after pressing [ctrl + alt + arrow key] to switch workspaces my screen turned purple-black (I'm colourblind) and asked for my login and password. I have no idea what my login is, I've tried using the name of the laptop and then the appropriate password but after about two seconds the screen will display \"Incorrect login\". I'm not sure how to fix this issue, it happened on multiple occasions and at random, causing me to have to reboot my laptop. Again, the laptop randomly turns to a purple-black screen and asks for 'eric-laptop login' (name of the laptop), and a password.\n\nA: I think it's likely you ended up on a TTY. \nTo return, just press Ctrl+Alt+F7 and you should be back to Ubuntu.\n", "Q: How can I share my internet connection from windows to ubuntu? Okay, so I have a mobile connection attached to my main pc (windows 8.1), the address range is 192.168.43.1 - 255 with the gateway being 192.168.43.1 and I want to share this to my Ubuntu server which is sitting in my LAN without an internet connection, my LAN address range is 10.1.1.1 - 255.\nI have tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Windows internet sharing but that wont work as there would be 2 dhcp servers on the LAN (not a good thing)\n\n*A proxy, but for windows I can't find any software that is actually good, I'm quite new to squid so not very sure how to configure it to what I need it to do.\n\n*VPN, this is also a nice option but again can't find any decent software for windows that can do it, if my main pc was windows server than it would be a different story.\nIf I could make the windows pc act as a gateway where the ubuntu server could just set a static IP pointing towards it without any dhcp server running, that would be great. But again I can't find any software to do this either.\nAny help is much appreciated. \n\nA: I actually fixed this a while ago so I'll share my findings. \nI haven't done exactly as my question asks but I found by using a Raspberry PI with a USB WiFi card as a router I could share my phone's internet connection to everything on my network.\nI used this script: http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/23 on my RPI, it can pretty much apply to any Linux distro though.\n\nA: if the windows computer is the host for the internet connection, go to control panel and hit change adapter settings. click on the wifi connection, then while holding CONTROL, click the ethernet button, and right click and click BRIDGE CONNECTION. this should share the connection fron the windows computer to the Ubuntu device\n", "Q: How to organize/sort images by EXIF image data I have recovered images from a lost partition and I need to sort them or put them into a folder by the creation date in the EXIF data of each image.\nI have installed digiKam and also shotwell but have not found the way to do this on any of the options.\nCan anyone explain to me how to do it with either of those programs or by any other method?\n\nA: This is the code I am using.

It was simple, but I don't know why it worked.\n\n\n*\n\n*Shut down the Ubuntu VM (13.10)\n\n*In Parallels 9 config for the VM, go to Hardware > Video, and disable 3D acceleration.\n\n*Restart Ubuntu 13.10. You will now get a completely black screen.\n\n*Shut down the Ubuntu VM once more.\n\n*Again, in Parallels config for the VM, go to Hardware > Video and reenable 3D acceleration.\n\n*Restart, and you're back in business (No black screen and everything properly updated).\n\n\nA: [I just realized the post above me has a MUCH simpler solution, by rechecking the video acceleration in the VM settings. Doh!]\nI have a solution. Reinstalling Parallels Tools blindly does the trick.\nThis just happened to me, with Mavericks, Parallels 9.0.24172, Ubuntu 13.10 and updates installed on 1 Mar 2014. On reboot, I could see the login screen, then after logging in, I could see the Unity \"Launcher\" or whatever the call the row of icons on the left, but the rest of the screen was black. If I click to start any apps, like Firefox, the icon in the bottom of the Parallels screen indicate that the re is disk activity as the app starts, but the screen remains black.\nTo fix:\n\n\n*\n\n*From the Parallels Desktop \"Virtual Machine\" menu, choose \"Reinstall Parallels Tools...\"\n\n*You will see the CD-Rom and Hard Disk icons in the bottom of the Parallels window blink green\n\n*Wait about 10 seconds until the Hard Disk icon settles down\n\n*Blindly type your password (make sure Parallels has focus in Mavericks)\n\n*You'll see the Hard Disk icon blinking green some more.\n\n*After a few minutes (I waited 5, just to be safe), make sure Parallels still has focus, and hit the Return key. Parallels will reboot.\n\n*Voilá! On reboot and re-login, the desktop is visible\n\n\nJust before I installed the Ubuntu updates, Parallels Tools had reinstalled itself, due to a new version of the Tools since I last used the VM, but it seems that certain kinds of Linux updates break the video driver. As stated above, always make a Parallels snapshot before running Ubuntu update, just to be safe.\n\nA: I experienced the blank screen issue with Parallels 9.0, Ubuntu 13.04,  Mavricks on a macbook air. This worked for me \n\n\n*\n\n*Shutdown\n\n*In Parallels 9 config for the VM, go to Hardware > Video, and disable 3D acceleration.\n\n*Restart and update Parallels tools\n\n*Enable 3D acceleration \n\n\nA: Same problem here with a MacBook Pro. Here's what worked for me after I updated 13.10 and received a black screen, although the toolbar on the left was showing.

It's a dual boot computer and I installed Ubuntu from Windows with Wubi.\nWhen I tried to boot into Ubuntu it said that \n\nErrors were found while checking the disk drive for /\n\nI search online and found that the command \n\nmount -o remount, rw /\n\nI tried it but only sometimes it worked and even then the computer then shut down suddenly...\nAnd when it didn't work. The following message was shown:\n\n/host: device is busy\n/run: device is busy\n/dev: device is busy\n\nBut I could boot into Ubuntu once and used boot-repair to generate a report.(Now I can't seem to be able to boot into Ubuntu anymore) It's here.\nWhen I tried to boot into Windows, it just got stuck at the Windows logo screen. And after a while it suddenly shut down.\nSo based on the report, what's the problem? Is it possible to fix the problem within Ubuntu if I got lucky again and boot into it?\nThanks!\n\nA: I would boot into the recovery mode, and enter a root terminal. From there, run fsck -A -y -f, to fix these errors.\nPlease note, however, this sounds like it could be a more serious hardware issue (I've never heard of a computer powering off from hard drive errors). If that doesn't work, odds are, something's malfunctioning inside your computer. Unless you're using a laptop with a not-so-good battery, I would strongly recommend taking your machine to a computer repair center, and have it professionally diagnosed.\n\nA: Have u tried booting into \"Ubuntu recovery mode\"??

I'm trying to do this tutorial for learning and it seems that I have to keep adding things for it to go smoothly. http://developer.ubuntu.com/apps/html-5/tutorial/\nI don't have the \"rss-sample.qml\" file at all in my project. I don't even have the html folder. Also as the tutorial shows, it's supposed to have the option for HTML5 Touch UI project but I had to use HTML5 Tabbed Touch UI instead because that's the closest option I have. Am I missing something?\n\nA: The HTML5 tutorial is outdated due to code changes in the SDK PPA. Very sorry for the confusion. For example, as you note, at the time the tutorial was written, there were two types of HTML5 app projects you could create: one for Cordova HTML5 apps, one for non Cordova HTML5 apps (which was named \"HTML5 Touch UI\"). There is now only a single type of HTML5 app project that supports all functionality. Another change is that HTML5 apps no longer have or need a qml file, as you noted. \nThe HTML5 app support is under rapid development now, so stay tuned for news of important enhancements of functionality!\n", "Q: How do I make my system to prompt me for Windows and Ubuntu, instead of directly booting to Ubuntu? I have new Lenovo laptop with pre-installed Windows 8. I was facing issues installing Ubuntu l2.04 LTS, so following a thread I made some changes, created some ext4, swap, bootloader partitions and then ubuntu installation worked miraculously . \nAlso, what I did was converted my system to boot from Legacy instead of UEFI (secure boot).\nNow, my system is not able to boot into Windows and it boots to Ubuntu directly and when I am trying to convert my Ubuntu to boot from EFI using Boot Repair, it tells me that my system is configured to boot from Legacy. \nHow do I get my system to show me prompt for me to select Windows or Ubuntu at bootup ?\nNOTE: My Windows is not deleted, it exists, all its file exits, which I can access from Ubunt. \nThanks so much for all the help.\n\nA: It seems your grub menu or bootloader. First boot into Ubuntu OS and then open terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T. Then run sudo update-grub command in terminal. If it doesn't work type sudo nautilus in the terminal and press Enter. From the window that opens, go to /etc/default/grub and change GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0 TO GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=10 and GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=true to GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET=false. Save it. Then run sudo update-grub. On restart you can make the boot menu appear by holding Shift.\n\nA: Windows is installed in UEFI mode, but Ubuntu is currently installed in Legacy mode. \nYou must convert Ubuntu into UEFI mode in order to be able to boot both systems from the GRUB menu.\n\nA: Thanks, for the answer. I did you have said, but I could still not boot into windows.\nSo, after future accessment, I found that when I change the Boot to UEFI, I do get the option to chose Windows and Ubuntu. But when I select Ubuntu, it shows me an error . But it does let me login to Windows successfully. All my documents and settings are as it is, nothing is lost.\nNow when I change the bios boot to Legacy, I again get the option to select but when I select Windows 8, it gives me an error saying \"file not found\", but I can login to Ubuntu in this case. \nUsing Boot-Repair, when trying to change the Ubuntu to UEFI under Locations, it gives me an error saying your system is set to boot from Legacy, change that first or else you might not be able to boot into anything.\nThanks for your help in advance.\n", "Q: How do I get text/html decoder plugins for Python 2.7 (Ubuntu 12.04) How do I get text/html decoder plugins for Python 2.7?

I need these in order to play some internet radio stations that are supported on an internet radio portal.\nCan you help ? Thanks!\n\nA: You don't need the plug-ins for Python 2.7. I'm not sure where you're getting the \"for Python 2.7\" from, but I would have to guess it's from the program that does the searching for codecs, being written in Python.\nInstead, you need codecs for GStreamer.\nHowever, there are no GStreamer plug-ins for handling text/html, as it is not a multimedia container format. It's a web page. If you're getting an error about a missing codec for it, the problem is that you're using the wrong URL, or the server is redirecting you to another URL, which is returning HTML, and acting like a successful connection.\nYou need to use the correct URLS to play these in Rhythmbox, Totem, or other players.\n", "Q: My hard disk has been formatted accidently I chose the second option for installing Ubuntu because I thought it would only remove Windows (8.1). However, now I have an empty hard drive.\nI had very important files on my hard drive. What should I do? My future as a vet has been formatted!\n\nA: If it were me, I would stop right now, don't touch it, and take it to a computer shop and let them recover it. There might be software out there that can do it, but I'm not sure of it and haven't used any.\nWhen data on a drive is \"deleted\", it isn't actually deleted, it is simply marked as \"deleted\" and new data is overwritten on it. As long as you haven't started writing data over it, it might be recoverable.\n\nA: Yes, definitely take it to a computer shop. They should have tools to recover sections of hard drives marked as deleted. However, this is a rather intricate process, and don't expect all of your data to remain intact. When installing Ubuntu it removed the part that indicated that it was NTFS.\n\nA: Taking the computer to a computer shop is one solution. But you can try a few things yourself at home.\nThe most important part is that read operations don't affect anything, but write operations do. Think of it this way: a file on your hard disk is stored as a series of 0's and 1's. A hard disk contains a file table which maps a set of 0's and 1's to a file. When you delete a file, the allocated space in the file table is simply marked as deleted but the actual contents is not yet removed. If you perform a quick format, the same principle applies. If you perform write operations, the space from the entries marked as deleted can be used to write your new files to the disk and the old file becomes irrecoverable. If you performed a secure erase the data is also explicitly overwritten and file recovery is practically a no-go.\nThe easiest thing to do is to hook up the hard drive to another computer. Either by putting it into a USB closure or hooking it up internally. As long as the OS is on another drive you'll be fine.\nOn Windows, there's a freeware tool called Recuva which you can try. It is capable of recovering quite a lot of files. Simply scan the hard drive and wait for the files to appear. Then export them to another drive.\nOn Linux, the operation might become a bit more complex. There's an Ubuntu guide which contains a lot of useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery\n\nA: Take it to a professional, whilst you can use certain tools to recover it yourself, you do run the risk of destroying data. \nI guess that I have been lucky that I did forensics and can recover data that way.\n", "Q: Get source code for copy/paste Every operation performed by operating system have a source code.

In multiple copy I can copy 2 or more text strings or files one after other from different location and paste after every thing is copied.(I want to avoid paste operation after every single copy operation.) Can anyone help me to find file containing Copy and Paste code?\nThank you. \n\nA: There's a single method of doing copy and paste in an X window system environment (GNOME, KDE .etc), namely Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V.\nHow this 'copy and paste' works?\nThe whole scenario involves two parties: client applications and clipboard manager.\ntheir behavior is specified in the freedesktop standard:\n1. http://standards.freedesktop.org/clipboards-spec/clipboards-latest.txt\n2. http://standards.freedesktop.org/clipboard-extensions-spec/clipboard-extensions-latest.txt\nsee http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/ClipboardManager for a general introduction.\nFor the clients, the required code is implemented in toolkits such as GTK and Qt.\nthe clipboard manager typically is a daemon program. In GNOME, the clipboard manager is a component of gnome-settings-daemon.\nAt the core of the clipboard implementation is a notion called \"Selections\" which is a X11-specific concept.\nIf you want to understand how clipboard works in a Linux environment, you need to learn how to program with low-level toolkit X11 first and get yourself familiar with concepts like Window, Property, Selection, Atom .etc.\nYou can get started with xclip source code.\n", "Q: Adobe flash player privacy settings Concerned with my privacy and the abuse that today every single company of jerks exert upon it I decided to switch from win 7 to Ubuntu but being a newbie (ubuntu is so much different!)

My powerful Linux desktop (12 core, 32GB RAM, SSD, fast processor, ubuntu 13.10) slows down to a crawl when I rsync from my internal drive to an attached USB3 NTFS drive. Typing any command, like \"df\" or \"ls\", takes 5-10 seconds to respond. The slow feel reminds me of a heavily swapping computer, but the \"free\" command says swap size is zero, with 29GB of RAM free (buffers).  \"uptime\" shows a load average of about 4.0, and \"top\" shows that the top processes are the rsync commands. I also see kswapd0 in the top few processes, but no swap space is being used and there's tons of free RAM.\nThe slowdown occurs even when I run rsync at a \"nice\" level of 19. The slowdown also lasts for about 1-2 minutes after I kill the rsync.\nThe slowdown doesn't happen with my other ext4 USB3 disk.\nThe actual transfer rate to the USB disk is fine: it is not slow.

So, my script was not actually hitting the USB drive, but writing to /media locally on my boot drive.\nIn other words, my boot drive (an SSD) was being hammered by rsync and filling up to 100%.

I have many Virtual box machines in my Ubuntu12.04, each time i shutdown or reboot i have to start them one by one. \nI wanna a help in writing script for automatically autostart the VBox machines when booting.\n\nA: After many unhappy hours trying to get the procedures in from kdmurray above to work, without success I eventually found a method that worked simply.\nFirst my Linux host (Mint 17) was set up at boot time to login automatically to my main account.\nSecond I used the facilities in VirtualBox GUI  (v4.3.12) to create a shortcut for each Virtual Machine on the desktop. {right-click the VM in left column & select \"Create Shortcut on Desktop\"}\nNext: I had already found that bringing up \nMenu->Control Centre -> Startup Applications -> Add \nand adding the desktop shortcuts gave files that did not work, I spotted from other answer on this page that the location of the startups is /home/USERNAME/.config/autostart\nso I did a right-click on each of the desktop VM shortcuts and then pasted them into that folder, overwriting the earlier crap files.  Now they developed the 'pretty' VirtualBox icons.\nAnd sure enough on restarting the host computer, the 3 VMs started automagically.\n:-) \nBill Williams\nPS: alas I still have something missing, because often the Virtual Machines will not start up on boot, instead they generate an error dialog box which says they are locked, even if I have told them to shutdown before the host was re-booted.\n\nA: You can use the VirtualBox Auto-start service. A good tutorial describing how to do this is posted on the \"Life of a Geek Admin\" blog.\nThe following steps are adapted from the linked blog post:\n\n\n*\n\n*First you need to create the file /etc/default/virtualbox and add a few variables.\nVBOXAUTOSTART_DB which contains an absolute path to the autostart database directory and\nVBOXAUTOSTART_CONFIG which contains the location of the autostart config settings. The file should look similar to this:\n# virtualbox defaults file\nVBOXAUTOSTART_DB=/etc/vbox\nVBOXAUTOSTART_CONFIG=/etc/vbox/vbox.cfg\n\n\n*Now we need to create the /etc/vbox/vbox.cfg file and add\n# Default policy is to deny starting a VM, the other option is \"allow\".\ndefault_policy = deny\n# Create an entry for each user allowed to run autostart\nmyuserid = {\nallow = true\n}\n\nNote: If the filename vbox.cfg doesn't work above, try naming it autostart.cfg.\nIf you are the only user you can just add the line default_policy = allow to the vbox.cfg file.\n\n*Set permissions on directory to the vboxuser group and make sure users can write to the directory as well as sticky bit.\nsudo chgrp vboxusers /etc/vbox\nsudo chmod 1775 /etc/vbox\n\n\n*Add each of the users to the vboxusers group. \nsudo usermod -a -G vboxusers USERNAME\n\n(replace USERNAME with the username)\nNOTE: If you have changed group permissions for the current user, log out and back in again to refresh the permissions. (credit @kR105)\n\n\n*Every user who wants to enable autostart for individual machines has to set the path to the autostart database directory with\nVBoxManage setproperty autostartdbpath /etc/vbox\n\nand enable autostart for an individual VM with\nVBoxManage modifyvm <uuid|vmname> --autostart-enabled on\n\nThis will create a myuserid.start  file in /etc/vbox directory\n\n*Now restart the vboxautostart-service to read in the changes.\nsudo service vboxautostart-service restart\n\n\n*Reboot your system and your VM should start\n\nA: In addition to the good description of the vboxautostart-service above, you can do \nVBoxManage modifyvm server --autostop-type savestate\n\nto automatically stop the guest at shutdown. For Ubuntu 14.04 I had to add a sleep 30 to the vboxautostart-service stop section, so that it waits until guest has been saved completely. \n\nA: I found a simpler way under Ubuntu 16.04 running VBox 5.1.34.  \nWhile in VBox, right-click on the running or idle VM in the list, select 'Create Shortcut on Desktop\".  Once you see the icon on your desktop, open with any tool that let's you see the underlying command VBox created (on my system, I right click and select 'properties')  Copy this to the clipboard.\nOpen the program to update 'startup applications' and create a new application that starts at boot time, pasting in the command you copied from the desktop link created by VirtualBox.\n\nA: I had similar unhappy incidents trying this operation on the vanilla LTS. \n~$ cat /etc/os-release \nNAME=\"Ubuntu\" \nVERSION=\"14.04.1 LTS, Trusty Tahr\" \n\nOn this version, the key file /etc/init.d/vboxautostart-service was not installed.\nAs far as I know all the VitualBox and requirements were put in by apt-get, so I cannot say why the 'vboxautostart-service' file was not also provided. But to get over this here are my update to kdmurray's post.\n1) /etc/default/virtualbox  file existed for me. So must add vars:\nVBOXAUTOSTART_DB=/etc/vbox\nVBOXAUTOSTART_CONFIG=/etc/vbox/autostart.cfg\n\n2) Must create /etc/vbox/autostart.cfg as indicated by OP.\n6b) Need to get a vboxautostart-service script and make it executable.\ncd /etc/init.d/\nsudo wget http://www.virtualbox.org/browser/vbox/trunk/src/VBox/Installer/linux/vboxautostart-service.sh?format=raw -O vboxautostart-service\nsudo chmod +x vboxautostart-service\n\n6c) Alert the rc.d controller, but I used 24 as the start time. Putting just 20 and it did not start up. Perhaps it ran even before virtualbox was working.\nsudo update-rc.d vboxautostart-service defaults 24 24\n\nThen rebooting launched the VM correctly. \n\nA: You can use vboxmanage startvm \"my virtual machine\" --type=headless|gui|sdl (one of those).

It just reports an error if I try to launch it:\n./googleearth-bin: error while loading shared libraries: libfontconfig.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nI already tried to re-install the package and added the libfontconfig-dev package, too, but still this error appears. Any ideas whats missing or how to fix?\n\nA: TL,DR: Try installing the libfontconfig1:i386 package.\nPackages whose names end in -dev provide header files, which don't help a binary executable to run. There's no need to remove the libfontconfig-dev package, but it's expected that installing it wouldn't help this situation.\nThe ia32-libs package, available in releases prior to 13.10, provided a number of commonly used 32-bit libraries. Generally speaking, 64-bit software never requires ia32-libs, but since the \"64-bit version/edition\" of a program just means it's the version for a 64-bit OS and not necessarily that all its native code is 64-bit, such a dependency is possible.\nThe motivating reason for the ia32-libs package was to provide libraries that are frequently needed by 32-bit programs on a 64-bit system, but would once have been hard to install, since the package manager would only install packages matching the version of Ubuntu installed.\nThe Ubuntu adopted MultiArch, which facilitates installing both 32-bit and 64-bit packages on the same 64-bit system, using the package manager. MultiArch support started a while ago, but the ia32-libs package was retained, mainly for backward compatibility and for the convenience it provided. (Actually, it was turned into a shortcut for installing the appropriate 32-bit library packages. Users installing it for the first time on a system with MultiArch would install the more descriptively named ia32-libs-multiarch package.)\nWell, finally ia32-libs and ia32-libs-multiarch are gone... but you can install install 32-bit libraries (and other packages) on your 64-bit Xubuntu 13.10 system, by specifying the package name and architecture for installation.\nYou have an error message that specifies a library file that is needed: libfontconfig.so.1. You appear to have only the 64-bit version of that library. (The 32-bit and 64-bit versions are stored in separate directories, in part to allow them both to be installed at the same time.)\nTo find out what package provides the file, search for it under \"Search the contents of packages\" at http://packages.ubuntu.com/. This reveals the package that provides it is libfontconfig1. You want to install the 32-bit version of that. Ubuntu's name for the 32-bit PC/Mac architecture is i386 (the 64-bit one, even for Intel processors, is amd64). So you can install this by running:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libfontconfig1:i386\n\nThen try running Google Earth again and see what happens.\nRelated: What happened to the ia32-libs package? (But note, the ia32-libs package remained a transitional package for ia32-libs-multiarch, which provided essentially equivalent functionality until 13.10 Saucy.)\n", "Q: Horizontal scrolling in Firefox to Shift+Mouse Scroll (instead of Back/Forward) On Ubuntu 13.10, with Chrome browser, gedit, Gimp etc. the Shift + Mouse Scroll == Horizontal scroll. \nWith Firefox (26.0) it behaves as Back/Forward page, which is really annoying.\nHow I can disable the Back/Forward functionality, and change it to horizontal scroll?\n\nA: Fortunately, there is a Firefox add-on for exactly this: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/shift-scroll/\nWorks great for me in Firefox 50.1.0\n\nA: Since Firefox 58 (this commit in particular) horizontal scrolling is the default action of Shift+Wheel, so no need to do anything special except upgrading Firefox.\n\nA: Here's how I finally got it work. I put it in very detailed form, so anyone can follow it easily.\n1) Open terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T)\n2) In terminal, run following commands:\nsudo apt-get install xautomation\nsudo apt-get install xbindkeys\n\n3) Create a new file called .xbindkeysrc.scm to your home directory, by running in terminal\ngedit ~/.xbindkeysrc.scm\n\n4) Add the following text to the file, save it, and close the text editor:\n; bind shift + vertical scroll to horizontal scroll events\n(xbindkey '(shift \"b:4\") \"xte 'mouseclick 6'\")\n(xbindkey '(shift \"b:5\") \"xte 'mouseclick 7'\")\n\n5) In terminal, run command\nxbindkeys\n\n6) With Firefox browser, go to address about:config\n7) Change following values (double click on value)\nmousewheel.with_shift.action  to 0 (from the default 2) \nmousewheel.with_shift.action.override_x 1 to 1 (from the default -1)\n8) Now Shift+Mouse Scroll should lead to horizontal scrolling on Firefox, instead of the default Back/Forward action.\n\nExtra information:\n3) .xbindkeysrc.scm is a hidden file (because it starts with a dot), and that's why you cannot see it with nautilus or other filesystem browser by default. You can hit Ctrl+H to see hidden files.\n5) It seems, that you have to run it only once -- not at every time you log on. I also tried removing the xbindkeys and the horizontal scroll worked until next reboot/login.\n7) If you set them as 1, -1, you will get \"diagonal scroll\" when trying to scroll fast. That's why I think it is necessary to use options 0, 1 instead of 1, -1.\n\nA: You can disable the Back/Forward functionality, by going into about:config and modifying mousewheel.with_shift.action to 1 instead of the default 2.\nI could not find a way to enable horizontal scrolling using the mousewheel as you see in Google Chrome but the left and right arrow keys do the job. However, I came across this:\n\nConfigure your Linux key binding to make Shift+Mouse wheel send an horizontal scroll event:\nInstall xbindkeys and xautomation. Edit ~/.xbindkeysrc.scm and write:\n; bind shift + vertical scroll to horizontal scroll events\n(xbindkey '(shift \"b:4\") \"xte 'mouseclick 6'\")\n(xbindkey '(shift \"b:5\") \"xte 'mouseclick 7'\")\n\nRun xbindkeys\n\nSource\nNote that I have not tried the above myself!\nYou may also want to look at  [Shift + Mouse-Scroll-Wheel] Does NOT Scroll Horizontally \n", "Q: SlickEdit won't install on 12.04 I can't run the SlickEdit installation on my Ubuntu machine.

So let's stick with another option.\nYou can use a DVD burning software to burn a DVD with the Ubuntu .iso file. After that, all you need to do is insert the disc and install.\nBut, since you're using Windows, I guess it would be much more simple if you just use a Windows Installer for Ubuntu instead of the .iso file.\nYou can get the installer in this page: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer\nAnd the installation instruction here: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/install-ubuntu-with-windows\nUnfortunately it's not available for Windows 8 and Ubuntu 13.10.\nIf you still want to try a .iso file installation I recommend you to take a look at the others two articles (How to burn a DVD - How to create a bootable USB stick) you can find in that last page I posted here (right of the page).\n", "Q: How to enable Ubuntu to read/play Arabic subtitles?

I was about to play around on my virtual machine running Ubuntu 12.04.\nI installed GIT-CORE using apt-get install git-core from repos. First I thought the apt-get command will install in the folder I am in, but I was wrong.\nSo is there a way to directly tell apt-get where to install ?\nOr do I have to move the files later? Let me know your best solution for this.\n\nA: I don't know if I understood the problem correctly, so the answer goes in two directions. The first: apt-get, deb packages, and source packages. The second: Git.\nThe first thing to say is that apt-get install does not choose where to install a package, but the package itself specifies that information. A .deb file is just a set of compressed directories which, in fact, has the proper install targets within. So, in short, no you can't change the apt-get install destination of the packages, because it has to do with the packages, not with apt-get. Last on this, each location within a deb goes to the particular GNU/Linux directory in your system, so /usr/share/bin cannot be changed by other, the same for the \"man\" pages, icons, etc. Once you touch the deb, it is actually a very tricky thing to handle.\nSecond, of course you can work-around the paths if you know what you are doing. It is not a simple task to do for beginners or intermediate users since you need to handle the deb packaging rules to modify the deb package. To do that, just download the package without installing it with apt-get, uncompress the package and edit the deb manifest and the files/directories you may want to change. Again, this is not encouraged at all and there is no reason to do this unless you are a developer that wants to test something in particular with that package.\nThird, you can always compile from the source. That will basically make a \"portable\" version of the software you want to install and will locate it on your home folder. Of course, it will carry a) lots of dev dependencies to build the source b) eventually solve different problems regarding the compilation. This is also not recommended for beginners, unless there is no other way to install that particular software (which clearly is not the case of Git).\nBut, probably you might just want to change the git location target folders? To do that you just need to configure your git account and the folders to sync. That process though has nothing to do with apt-get. Check some guides on how to do it here or here. Of course, you can always see the official page or the man page of git (man git in a shell).\n", "Q: Can I use several antivirus apps in the same time? I have many friends which are Windows users and I wont to keep my system and my flash drives virus-free for obvious reasons. \nRecently, after I posted a question on Ask Ubuntu, I was encouraged to try Bitdefender for Unices. I have installed Bitdefender via command line, because it is easier. And also, I have installed Comodo Antivirus. Both of them are interesting apps and I was able to clean my flash drives. Still, I wont to try other Antivirus software as well. \nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can I keep both antiviruses installed (and install others too)? I know that when I was on Windows I was told that I should keep only one antivirus installed because two such software can enter in some conflict. I remember that I had once two antiviruses installed, but one of them was set on inactive. In order to scan the PC I used them alternatively, each of them avoiding the quarantine folder of the other software. \n\n*So, having in mind my Windows experience regarding these Antivirus apps, what attitude should I have when I'm on Linux? Is is OK to install several such apps (in order to use them paranoically to scan flash drives?). \n\n*And if this is OK, what settings should I have in order to avoid conflicts between them? \n\n*Should I ask them to avoid the quarantine folder as I did in Windows? \nSorry for the complex question, but I don't think is worthy to ask several tiny things when I can ask all of them considering the fact that they are inter-related. thank you in advance for your patience and explications!\n\nA: Windows viruses will in most of the cases do nothing in Linux, so seen statistically you will be as safe as you are now without installing any antivirus software. I personally consider antivirus software to be on its own a kind of virus: you have no control what it really does and to whom they report your private data, they can delete files they do not like at will and just tell you it was virus (by mistake, or because someone pays them to do that), they spread around and multiply themselves using social fear, they form a net you cannot control and that runs arbitrary code.\nThis being said, if you trust these antivirus software programs and you find them good, there is nothing technically that prevents you to install as many different antivirus software programs as you like at the same time. They will compete with each other for system resources, for file access (file access is less an issue on Linux than on Windows), and may detect each other hooks as viruses, but if they are coded properly they will handle any special errors correctly. The more you install the more false positives you may get - that is, something that is no really a virus will be identified wrongly as such. However, for some people, it is always better to kill 10 innocents more, than leave one that is possibly guilty escape - same applies to hunting for computer viruses. You can of course always report any issues as bugs to the antivirus vendors.\nSo as long as your system runs fast and you are happy with the results, you can install two or more antivirus software programs at the same time - if that makes you feel safer. For sure, you should give each of them another quarantine folder location and exclude that one from each other scans.\n\nA: \nI am a Linux user, my friends are not. But they do call me to help them solve PC-related problems. In order to that, I often have to use my flash drives. So I have to keep my drives clean in order to avoid infecting my friends' machines.\n\nYou normally should just need Clam-AV and just scan your memory while swapping from a friend to the next or better yet, don't store personal/important stuff while helping your friend, if you plug the memory in your system and find some files that weren't there, is pretty obvious that that friends is infected. It doesn't matter that you keep the flash drive clean since the source/root of the viruses are not cleaned (Windows). The flash drives are only transmission agents and keeping them clean is just trying to hide the sun with a finger.\nFix your friends viruses (maybe total re-installation) and then keep them clean with a good antivirus, aka Linux.\n", "Q: Text editors need root access to work correctly I'm using Ubuntu 13.10, and I have a problem with 3 text editors - Geany, Gedit and Sublime Text. \nThese 3 editors cannot access most of their menu items, including Open file and Save file.\nThe only way to access these menu items is to open those editors using root access. \nThe only editor that seems to work without root access is Adobe Brackets.\nI'm not talking about root files, I'm talking about the menu items which are not accessible when just opening the editor (even with no documents open).\n\n\nA: It sounds like the folder is not owned by your user, so you can't write to it - to sort this out either run this for a file:\nsudo chown USERNAME:USERNAME /PATH/TO/FILE\n\nor this for a folder/directory:\nsudo chown -R USERNAME:USERNAME /PATH/TO/FOLDER\n\nThese commands will make the user USERNAME and group USERNAME the owner of the file or folder specified.\nAlternately, you could just make 'Other' users have access to the file:\nsudo chmod 766 /PATH/TO/FILE\n\nor folder:\nsudo chmod -R 766 /PATH/TO/FOLDER\n\nHere are manual pages on chmod and chown\nYou can check the permissions of the contents of a folder by running:\nls -l /PATH/TO/FOLDER\n\nYou should get something like this:\ndrwxr-xr-x. 2 wilf wilf      4096 Jan 10 15:59 Desktop\ndrwxr-xr-x. 2 wilf wilf      4096 Jan 10 00:32 Documents\ndrwxr-xr-x. 3 wilf wilf      4096 Jan 10 18:25 Downloads\n-rw-rw-r--. 1 wilf wilf     70582 Jan 11 22:22 gnomeRemove.txt\n\nWhere the drwxr-xr-x. is a directory with read and execute permissions to all users, with write permissions for the owner.\nYour username should also be in place of wilf.\n\nA: Try another Desktop environment, as this is probably a bug in the current Desktop Environment and/or Window Manager that is causing the problem - the most similar would  be:\n\n*\n\n*Gnome\n\n*Gnome Fallback\n\n*MATE\n\n*Cinnamon\nothers possibilities might be:\n\n*\n\n*KDE\n\n\n*LXDE\n\n\n*XFCE\nThe links I haven given have tips on installation and customization.\n\nFor the most similar thing to Unity, use Gnome Versions between 3.4 and 3.8 may be best.:\n\n(source: wikimedia.org)\nThere is a search overview as well, if anything it is better than Unity's\nIf you want a Unity - like launcher as well, use the Dash to Dock extension.

If you are, this is the first time this is happening with that PPA, in that, with the latest package builds (For 319, 331 and I could guess any other updated package build) they have merged the Bumblebee and Primus packages into one. So when you install any of the Nvidia-??? packages you are also installing the latest bumblebee and primus ones.\nThis is good in a sense that now you install 1 packages and it installs the drivers for either Hybrid systems or normal, common, one Nvidia to rule them all computers. The problem here is that the Bumblebee configuration files and blacklisting the Nvidia-??? modules, so you will get a horrible black screen upon rebooting.\nIf you ONLY have an Nvidia card, PCI-EX one like mentioned on your question and there is no hybrid system on that same computer (just in case) then I would suggest to do the following:\nsudo apt-get purge bumblebee primus   \nsudo rm -fr /etc/modprobe.d/bumblebee.conf\nsudo reboot\n\nThis will remove the bumblebee packages which you don't need for that system. It will then remove the blacklisting file that is creating all the mess. Lastly it will reboot the computer after which, your system should run just fine. This is all thanks to a finding by Tareeq in this Bug report. If this applies to you please let the Bug in launchpad know by clicking on the \"Is this affecting you\" message. If not then we can proceed with other ways of solving it.\nI will also encourage you to read the Nvidia installation and configuration guide to shed some light on the problem: How do I install the Nvidia drivers? and possible solutions\n\nA: I could think of two alternatives you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use either x-swat or x-org edgers repositories (preferably the first, which should be more stable)\n\n*Manually install the nvidia drivers\nThe 2nd choice is heavily discouraged by Ubuntu official docs, but I did this once myself and it worked.

You probably got the order of the disks wrong when you recreated the array, so you will need to try again with the correct order.\n", "Q: How do I explain what Ubuntu is to someone who's never heard of it? I need to explain to friends what Ubuntu is and I don't want to link them just to the wikipedia page. I want them to get a guide with the right information. \n\n\n*\n\n*What is Ubuntu? \n\n*How do I use it? \n\n*What does the name Ubuntu mean?\n\n\nA: work in progress\n\nIntroduction\nUbuntu is a free and opensource operating system. It's based on Debian and runs the Linux Kernel. \nTerminal\nOne of the upsides with being based of Debian is that you have access to the apt-get system. This means that you can easily install and remove applications via the command line. This system is the same for a server and a desktop. \nIf I'm new to Ubuntu why should I learn some basic commands, why not just use the GUI?\n\n\n*\n\n*Because most things are easier and faster to do via the terminal. Things like installing and removing software it's just sudo apt-get install packagename to install an application and to remove just type sudo apt-get remove packagename. Doing the same in the GUI involves more steps and takes more time.\n\n*Don't enter a command you don't understand. If you don't understand it then you don't know when it's going wrong and what can happen when it does. Look up the command you want to use before entering it. You can use man command to find out what it does, like man apt-get.\n\n\nIf you prefer to manage programs via the GUI instead I would start with the Software Center, more information can be found here.  \nServer or Desktop?\nEvery release of Ubuntu comes as two different types:\n\n\n*\n\n*One is the server version, which installs without a GUI (Graphical User\nInterface). The server can run on any system that meet the minimum\nsystem requirements.\n\n*The other version is the Desktop which comes with a GUI and the basic\napplications that you need. The Ubuntu desktop ahs higher minimum\nsystem requirements than the server since it runs with a GUI and it\ncomes with more applications pre-installed.\n\n\nWait, there are also different versions depending on the hardware you have. \n32-bit or 64-bit?\nThe two most used are the 32-bit and 64-bit. but there are more specific versions like the PPC Power PC version and the minimal install. These also come as server and Desktop edition. \n\n\n*\n\n*64-bit -  Is the one you should use if you have a newer computer, this is the general recommendation because it works for all new computers. but if you have an older computer and aren't sure if your processor support the 64-bit version. Either lookup your computer and find out if it supports 64-bit or choose the 32-bit version. \n\n*32-bit - This version is support by all computers that runs the x86 platform, which is all intels and AMD processors. \n\n*PowerPC - The PPC version isn't officially supported anymore and is only released by enthusiasts, so this version may come out at a later time than the 32-bit and 64-bit version. There is no guarantee that it will be released at all. \n\n*Minimal install - It only consists of the necessary packages to start the installation, it will download the rest of the packages while installing, thus it requires an internet connection. \nWhat is normal release and LTS release?\nThere are two types of releases, one is the Long term support (LTS) that is released every 2 year and is supported for 5 years. The LTS is aimed to be stable and doesn't therefor come with the latest software. It's a system that desire stability and \n\n\n*\n\n*The LTS release schedule can be found here. \n\n\nThe other version is the normal release, it follows the LTS but it comes with all the latest software. this is the version for anyone who wants the latest software but also want a stable system. The normal release is released every 6 month, and has an Alpha and Beta release. \nBut the Alpha and Beta are unstable and is only to be used if you can live with crashes.\nMore information can be found here: \n\n\n*\n\n*How do I find out which version and derivative of Ubuntu is right for my hardware in terms of minimal system requirements?\n\n*How do I install Ubuntu?\n", "Q: How to optimize sata hard disk in ubuntu 12.04? How to optimize sata hard disk - HDD (Not A SSD) in ubuntu 12.04 for better performance.\n\n\n*\n\n*Hard Disk ( HDD ): 500 GB - Not a SSD\n\n*Ram: 4GB 1GB\n\n*1 GB Nvidia Graphic Card\n\n*Intel Core i5 Second Generation Procesor\n\n\nA: If your computer use involves accessing lots of files, I would suggest you mount your HDD with \"noatime\" option. You will see significant improvement because not every file-read will be written to filesystem.\nSo, in your /etc/fstab add this:\nUUID=24d75db7-ceca-40f7-ac21-979870a15ad6 /               ext4    noatime,errors=remount-ro 0       1\nHope this helps any.\n\nA: hdparm is a command line utility for the Linux operating systems to set and view SATA and IDE hard disk hardware parameters. It can set parameters such as drive caches, sleep mode, power management, acoustic management, and DMA settings.\nChanging hardware parameters from suboptimal conservative defaults to their optimal settings can improve performance greatly. For example, turning on DMA can in some instances double or triple data throughput.\nUsage:\nsudo su                   # Login as root\n\nhdparm -tT /dev/sda       # Perform device read timings and cache read timings\n\nhdparm /dev/sda           # To check the current settings of /dev/sda\n\nhdparm -i /dev/sda        # Display drive identification.\n\nRead more from here.\n", "Q: How can I reset my Unity Launcher settings? Today I tried to change the alt+tab behavior of my Ubuntu because I did not like the grouped layout. I tried two shell scripts I found in a git gist. My problem is that since I used those scripts the behavior of Dash changed: when a program tries to notify me Dash appears for me (it is on auto-hide) and the application icon shakes for 5 seconds and it is often followed by the freezing of that application. Before I tampered with the settings it was shaking for only half a second and there were no freezing. How can I revert to the default settings?\nI tried unity --reset but I received error messages (complaining about the lack of opengl and ending in a Segmentation Fault). I tried removing and reinstalling Unity and Compiz:\napt-get remove unity --purge\napt-get remove compiz --purge\napt-get install unity\napt-get install compiz\n\nbut nothing changed. How can I reset to my previous state (before running the scripts)? Some of my apps are freezing ever since I ran them although I reverted the changes in the shell scripts.\n\nA: Though the methods outlined in the other answer work for 12.04 to reset Unity, If you would like to revert the state cleanly and completely, you will need to use ppa purge to purge the two ppas that were added, re-install the packages that the script removed, and hope it solves the problem.\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:webupd8team/java\nsudo ppa-purge ppa:noobslab/mint\nsudo apt-get install zeitgeist zeitgeist-core zeitgeist-datahub python-zeitgeist rhythmbox-plugin-zeitgeist geoclue geoclue-ubuntu-geoip geoip-database whoopsie ubuntuone-client* python-ubuntuone-storage* ubuntuone-installer* menu apt-xapian-index oneconf\nsudo apt-get purge nemo\n\nThat partially reverts the changes done at the package level. I did not include a command to automatically uninstall all that were installed by the script for fear of removing something you need.\nAs a general rule, do not run a script if you are not sure what it does. It adds ppas and does not update apt before installing, so I have absolutely no idea why they were added in the first place. It installs a lot of stuff that was added probably only for his specific needs. Worse, that script made no backup of current settings, so they are lost forever.\n\nA: You should be resetting the gsettings/dconf/gconf parameters instead. Those are found in your home directory in .conf or .dbus. So to effectively reset the settings:\ndconf reset /com/canonical/unity/launcher\n\nThere are more aggressive like moving the .conf directories:\nmkdir ~/dot.bk/\nmv ~/.conf/dconf ~/dot.bk/\nmv ~/.dconf ~/dot.bk/\n\nRestart your session.\n\nA: unity --reset\n\nin terminal, of course...\nor try this script. just install it:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:freyja-dev/unity-tweak-tool-daily\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install unity-tweak-tool\n\nand when you install it, just exectute this command:\nunity-tweak-tool --reset-unity\n\n", "Q: Install NVidia drivers from .run provided by geforce.com I am currently using the Nvidia 319 drivers provided by Ubuntu repos, but I want to use the 331 driver.

The function keys still work, but the jittering is \"stronger\" and will keep on jittering.\nAlso the \"brightness changed\" notification doesn't go away, but I guess that's intentional seeing as how the brightness is constantly changing.\n\n\n\nA: This is not an direct answer to your question, but is a workaround. \nDownload the .deb file of Brightness Controller from http://lordamit.github.io/Brightness/. Though It is in Software Center but still is not available for Ubuntu 13.10 (We are working on a newer version which will be submitted for all supported versions of Ubuntu within a month).\n\nIt supports controlling brightness up to two displays.\n", "Q: What's Ubuntu's app development IDE? \n*\n\n*What's Ubuntu's official IDE used to develop applications?\n\n*Which language is preferred for Ubuntu apps?\n\nA: \nWhat's Ubuntu's official IDE used to develop applications?\n\nQt Creator, Eclipse, MonoDevelop. \n\n\n*\n\n*Reference\n\nWhich language is preferred for Ubuntu apps?\n\nQML, HTML5, C++.\n\n\n*\n\n*Reference\n\nA: I believe the answers to your question are both \"none\"... ubuntu has no official IDE and no preffered language for apps. And that is actually expected to be so: Preferred IDE and language is a matter of what you want/need to do and your personal tastes, rather than the OS you're on.\nThat said, I suggest you try to start developing with no IDE at all... use a text editor of your choice and compile by command-line. That will help you understand exactly how your IDE is helping you whenever you use one (I'm assuming you're about to start programming).\nAs for the programming language, I use Python for quick tasks, because it's a really easy to use and intuitive language. For more complex tasks I use C++. But that's because I have more experience with C++ than Python. AFAIK you can do almost anything with Python too.\nThere's also the GUI issue, and I believe the major native alternatives are GTK+ and Qt (and maybe wxWidgets). I have not much to tell you here, because I have no experience with GUI on Linux, but from what I read, it seems like a matter of taste too.\n", "Q: How do I install an ASUS USB-AC56 WiFi adapter? I'm trying to get this ASUS USB-AC56 adapter installed on Ubuntu 12.04, but when I try to extract the Linux file from the cd, it says I don't have the right permissions to extract. I tried downloading the driver from the ASUS website but I can't install it. I don't know the proper syntax. Can anyone help me out?\n\nA: Although an old question, one additional driver is found at https://github.com/codeworkx/rtl8812au_asus. To install the driver you have to run make and sudo make install. I find this driver to work better than any other found online. Keep in mind though that dkms install is not setup and therefore you will have to install the driver manually on each kernel upgrade.\nBear in mind that for Ubuntu versions after 14.04 the drivers need to be signed otherwise Secure Boot will not let them load. So, even if the driver compiles it will not load. One solution is to disable Secure Boot or use the mokutil --disable-validation command\n\nA: If lsusb says that the device is 0b05:17d2, then you need the driver 8812au.

If it's about graphics and it's older than 12 months, it's probably starting to fall behind the current state of things.\n", "Q: Dualboot Windows 8 and Ubuntu on separate HDD I have a question on dual booting Windows 8 and Ubuntu. My PC has an 8 GB SSD that has Windows 8 on it and a 1tb HDD for data. I just want to know how this will affect dual boot. Can I just split my 1 tb drive and add Ubuntu as I would for a PC with only 1 HDD?\n\nA: Yes. Tell GRUB to put the boot loader on the first drive, if it asks. Should be no problem. I have done this with two fixed disks and I am not aware of a reason the SSD and one fixed disk would not work the same way.\n", "Q: Hidden Interface configuration? During installation of Ubuntu server 13.04, I configured the primary ethernet interface. This interface is visible in the /etc/network/interfaces file.\nThe system has two additional interfaces which I do not have configured. Nothing in the /etc/network/interfaces file.\nWhen I do ifconfig, I see all three ethernet interfaces. The one which I have configured during the installation process and this is part of /etc/network/interfaces and the two other ethernet interfaces. These two other interfaces are configured with dhcp.\nWho has configured these interfaces? Ubuntu?\nWhat will happen when I will edit these two interfaces in the /etc/network/interfaces file? \nI only uses the commandline, no GUI!\n\nA: Looks like network-manager is managing your interfaces. You should probably uninstall it if you don't want that to happen: sudo apt-get remove network-manager. Or maybe disable it so that if something goes wrong you can reactivate it (you can see how to disable it on the link below, section \"Disabling NetworkManager\"). Or you could comment everything in /etc/network/interfaces and try to configure everything using NetworkManager (there's the nmcli cli tool).\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkManager\n", "Q: Yet another \"Computer won't boot from Ubuntu Install Media\" question I've been banging my head against a wall.  I have an older machine with a Gigabyte P35-DS3L motherboard.  For some reason it'll boot other installs from USB and CD/DVD-ROM, but not Ubuntu.  (Tried from both USB and CD/DVD-ROM with same results.)  It just hangs shortly after POST after detecting PCI devices, the last thing in the list is ACPI.  Normally after that it would say something about DMI pool, but it just hangs there before the DMI pool thing.  I understand this is anecdotal, just offering as a frame of reference were the boot process hangs.  \nIt'll boot windows 7 installer from usb along with several other random \"start-up\" utilities but not Ubuntu.  \nI've also confirmed that the same USB sticks (I've tried several) do work in my other machines.  The other PC's boot from the Ubuntu USB media just fine, so I know the MBR and boot \"stuff\" is there and working.  One such machine is also an older Gigabyte UD3P based board.  Another machine is a much newer UEFI based ASrock Ext3Gen3 board.  Just won't work on the DS3L for some reason?\nI've spent many hours pouring over BIOS settings, using F12 boot menu, trying different methods of creating the bootable usb sticks (both unetbootin and universal USB installer, etc etc...)  Also have tried re-downloading the iso files several times, all of which worked fine on the other machines.\nAny thoughts or ideas?  \n\nA: I would suggest disconnecting all non essential hardware. I once had a problem where I couldn't get an OS to install on a computer (The installation process would crash) just because it didn't like my card reader being connected during the install process.

Are there any official counters which keep a track on the number of downloads of a particular Ubuntu version across different derivatives? If there are no official counters, is there any source which would help me make a reliable estimate about the number of downloads?\nI need this information for my project, specifically for Ubuntu 13.10.\n\nA: Ubuntu does not count how many users downloads it. Since Ubuntu does not require registrations and because there are so many non-official mirrors, there is simply no way to count how many times it is downloaded (let alone installed).\nAccording to some assumptions there are ~20 million Ubuntu users worldwide.

So essentially create a simple server like so:\n// hello_node.js\nvar http = require('http');\nhttp.createServer(function (req, res) {\n  res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});\n  res.end('Hello Node.js\\n');\n}).listen(8124, \"127.0.0.1\");\nconsole.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8124/');\n\nand then run it in nodejs with the following:\nnode hello_node.js\n\nAnd then when I was trying to use npm to install something, it was failing and reporting the same node not found message.\n\nA: The node package is unrelated to NodeJS.

But if you still need the node command (because a script uses only nodefor example), the correct way is to install the nodejs-legacy package:\napt-get install nodejs-legacy\n\nand not create a symlink on your own (especially not in /usr/bin/).

I use nvm (node version manager) and for me to use the npm command I must always issue before npm this command nvm use 0.x (replace 0.x with 0.11 or 0.10 for example, the version you wish to use).\n\nA: As minerz029 has already mentioned, certain versions of the nodejs package won't provide the node binary due to another package previously using that name. The solution is as simple as following the installatoin steps on Node's own website:\nInstalling Node.js via package manager | Debian and Ubuntu based Linux distributions\nAt the moment, those steps are:\ncurl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -\nsudo apt-get install -y nodejs\n\nBut it'd be best to check the source link to make sure you're using the latest version.\n", "Q: What version of theora is ffmpeg using I have compiled the recent version of ffmpeg with the support for theora encoding with libtheoa.

The data is saved in a text file for which each new event is appended in a new line.\nEvery-time I need to re-analyse the data I transfer the file to a ubuntu computer by ssh, this is fine at the beginning but when the file passes the 1GB it starts to be really time consuming to transfer the hole file again and again, when only the last lines are different.\nTo give you an idea the experiments runs for around 3h, transfer takes ~5min per GB, files have typically a max of 3GB and files have a line number in the order of the tens of million.\nIn case you have a solution that works only for a linux to linux transfer I am also interested, maybe I can try it with cygwin.\n\nA: rsync is what you need, and it should be available for Windows. \nrsync is famous  for  its delta-transfer  algorithm,  which  reduces the amount of data sent over the network by sending only the difference between  the  source  files     and  the  existing  files in the destination. (taken from man rsync).\nInstall rsync on your windows system, then from the Linux system do:\nrsync --progress ip.of.windows.server:/path/to/file ./\n\nIt will transfer only the parts that changed. If the file evolves as you say, then each transfer will be very small and fast.\nNote that rsync connects using ssh, so if you have ssh already set up and working, rsync should also work fine.\n\nA: If only the last few lines of the file change each time, transferring the whole file again and again is not the best solution.\nThere are tools out there that calculate the differences of the file and copy over only the new bits, like rsync (using delta encoding, more info here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync)\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 & 13.10 won't boot from USB pen I tried with both 32bit versions, 12.04 & 13.10, but none of them will boot.\nI create the usb drive with pendrivelinux, i pick the destro, iso, format and go.\nAs mentioned below, i also tried unitbootin and lili, but same result.\nWhen machine turns on it doesn't matter if i use f12 or go through bios.

I am trying to create a simple script which will resize images. Here it is:\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"Script executed from: ${PWD}\"\n\n#copy image and resize it\nOUTPUT_IMG=\"newimg.png\"\nPATH=\"${PWD}/${OUTPUT_IMG}\"\n\ncp \"$1\" ${OUTPUT_IMG}\nmogrify -resize 400x300 ${PATH}\n\nI am calling script with 1 parameter (image to be resized)\nscript thisImage.png\n\nBut I get error cp command not found and mogrify command not found.\nAll this works without a script meaning that I have installed all these apps. \nAny ideas?\n\nA: The variable PATH has a predefined meaning: it's the search path for programs. When you type a command name, the shell (or any other program that you tell to execute this command) looks for an executable file in one of the directories mentioned in the PATH variable. In your script, cp is searched in a subdirectory called newimg.png of the current directory (which doesn't even exist, let alone contain an executable file called cp.\nUse a different variable name in your script. By convention, environment variables that have a meaning to programs are usually in all uppercase. For variables that are local to a script, you can use lowercase letters to avoid clashes (variable names are case-insensitive). Better, use a more significant name (because having variables that only differ in case is confusing to humans).\n#!/bin/bash\necho \"Script executed from: ${PWD}\"\n\n#copy image and resize it\noutput_image_name=\"newimg.png\"\noutput_image_path=\"${PWD}/${OUTPUT_IMG}\"\n\ncp \"$1\" \"$output_image_name\"\nmogrify -resize 400x300 \"$output_image_path\"\n\nThere's no reason to sometimes use the file name and sometimes the full path here though. Furthermore, instead of copying the file then modifying it in place with mogrify, you might as well use convert directly — convert is the same as mogrify except that it writes to a different output file.\n#!/bin/bash\noutput_image=\"newimg.png\"\nconvert -resize 400x300 \"$1\" \"$output_image\"\n\n\nA: PATH is a predefined shell variable that holds the search path for commands.  You can see its default value by executing echo $PATH.  Since you used it in your script, it over-wrote the search path, and could no longer find any commands that are not fully specified, including cp and mogrify, thus the two errors.\nUse a different variable instead of \"PATH\".

I'm also having network issues, like extremely slow internet and lots of timeouts.  \nPlease help me! I'm new to Ubuntu and I like it and want to learn how to use it.   \n\nA: First welcome to Ubuntu. Nothing you described sounds abnormal and although it is possible you were \"hacked\", it is extremely unlikely.\nAs with any OS it takes some time to understand things that are new and new ways of system administration.\nI suggest you start with the following 2 links :\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo\nAnd then work your way through the official documentation\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/\nOnce you have gotten a start, come on back if you have a more specific question.\n\nA: Easy. You can simply run:\nsudo chown [[your username]] [[path to directory]]\n\nIt must be noted that this tool has power. You should only change ownership (if broken) of your home folder. \nI had this problem with Apache, in the /var/www folder. This worked there. \nSince viruses are so rare in the Ubuntu/linux platform, I would recommend that if this doesn't work, you try reinstalling Ubuntu altogether. Backup your files by copying them to something external, and then use an external image to reinstall Ubuntu. \n", "Q: Deleted windows partition from Ubuntu and now can't boot I recently was performing a fresh install of Windows on one of the partitions on my SSD and for some reason I decided to delete the windows boot partition from within Ubuntu before cloning over a factory reset version of Windows from another drive (using Clonezilla). All I ever touched was the big C: partition I had been using for windows, but when I rebooted, I couldn't even access Ubuntu: the windows boot manager I had been using to dual boot still showed both options but BOTH of them gave me errors that it couldn't find bootable media. What do you think happened? Did I screw up my MBR? I've connected the drive to another system using a usb-SATA connection and it shows the volumes I'd expect still there, but the ubuntu partition now shows up as RAW. I'm worried that I may not be able to recover my Ubuntu installation which is exactly what I was trying to avoid. \nSince then I've done various things to do a fresh install of windows on the old (newly reformatted) partition, including using the windows installation disk and each time the installation is supposedly successful but the computer will never boot into an OS. Repairs to the MRB don't seem to have any affect. I'm going to try and save an image of the RAW partition that used to contain ubuntu, wipe the drive, and try cloning a drive that is booting properly, but I don't know what I should do to make sure that I can get my Ubuntu install back. I have saved an image to a exFAT USB and I can also make a partition-partition backup on another drive (using clonezilla) but I don't know what format the target partition should be. I can't make it ext4 in windows and I can't make it RAW either. \nSomeone please help! What did I do when I deleted my windows partition from within Ubuntu?\nThanks.\n\nA: The first thing you should do is try to see the actual partitioning of your disk. If your Ubuntu partition is still there, then not all is lost.\nSo, get an Ubuntu live DVD or USB and boot from it. Then open the Disks application to see what's on your hard disk.\nIf your Ubuntu partition is still there, then you can install boot-repair and repair Grub.\nOpen a new Terminal, then type:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Enter.\n\n*Then type: sudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && (boot-repair &)\n\n*Press Enter \nChoose the recommended repair option.\n", "Q: Netbeans 7.4 refuses to close?

I need a simple way to change permissions so that anyone can read and write anywhere on the drive. If it can be done without the terminal, so much the better! \nLong version:\n3 years ago I bought a BuffaloHD-PXTU2 1 terabyte USB drive for archiving. At the time my wife and I both had Windows XP, but we wrote to the drive directly rather than using the Buffalo Windows Utility provided. \n2 years ago I installed Kubuntu 12.04 on my computer, though still use XP occasionally. Still no problems copying. \nA year ago my wife's computer blew up and she bought a pretty iMac. I cannot get the Mac to write to the Buffalo drive, though it will read. I believe the problem is that Kubuntu has at some stage taken over and hijacked the permissions, though I can still write with XP. \nIn fact, after my wife's computer blew up, I copied data from her hard drive to the Buffalo drive and thence later to the new Mac. Whatever the cause, I need a simple way to change permissions so that anyone can read and write anywhere on the drive. If it can be done without the terminal, so much the better! \n\nA: It could be a formating issue. Mac's aren't equipped to write to NTFS, and with a drive of that type it could easily be formatted as NTFS. \n1) Backup the entire drive. You should be able to drag and drop all of the contents to a desktop folder.\n2) Go to launchpad, and then search for 'Disk Utility' \n3) Find your drive. You should be able to find it by space. \n4) Click 'erase'. This formats your drive into something Mac can read.\n5) When it's done, put all of your files back. \nOne of the things I don't understand is that Linux and Windows can both read and write to NTFS, but for some strange reason this doesn't work. You should be able to still write on a Linux platform, but I understand that it may be convenient for getting files back and forth. \n", "Q: How to \"fix\" the size of Windows Button Item in xfce4-panel 4.10.1 just finished installing ubuntu 13.10 with xubuntu Desktop and i tried to have a \"windows 7\" look (I know, some of you will hate me but after 15 years using windows, it is hard to loose the habit of the bottom bar and the start menu.\nHowever, after fallowing the PCWORLD guide how-to-make-ubuntu-linux-look-like-windows-7 Installing and customizing Xfce, I would like to fix the Panel I have set up.\nEven if I followed the guide entirely, when I added the Window Buttons Item, I realized that it has a dynamic size and doesn't look like the guide....all the Items \"on the right side\" (Separator, Notification Area, Indicator Plugin, Show Desktop) do not stay fixed but they move from left to right and right to left depending how many \"windows\" I open.:\n\n\nAnyone of you has an Idea how to fix the size so I will have my bar looking like the windows on with the Start button on the left, the clock and plugins on the right and then the middle empty when windows are not opened?\nThank you\n\nA: Resolved finding a post on another Forum....\n\"add a separator to the panel just to the left of the items you want to have on the right.

When you turn on the machine press F12 to enter the boot selection then press C to choose CD-ROM.\nIn my experience when a virtual machine complains about inability to read the boot medium it usually means that the vm hard drive's partition table has become corrupted, or the vm hard drive file itself has become corrupted.

I have a HP Pavilion laptop with an NVIDIA GPU. With each major upgrade of the Ubuntu OS I've had a battle getting the nvidia driver to behave, but each time I have managed it. A while ago I updated to 13.10, went through the usual dance, and got it working. A few days ago, however, I did a minor software update and now the graphics driver is completely hosed. After much fiddling its now got to the point where I'm completely stumped as to how to proceed. The repeatable sequence I can do is:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot into kernel 3.11.0-15-generic\n\n*when it tries to boot X, the nvidia splash screen fails with lots of picture noise\n\n*A primitive dialog pops up to say that the system is running in low graphics mode. None of the options presented in that and subsequent dialogs seem to help.\n\n*I Ctl-Alt-F1 into the console and check that:\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-331\nwhich seems to be the latest driver from nvidia.\nI select it using:\nsudo jockey-text -l\nsudo jokey-text -e kmod:nvidia-331\n\nWhich runs fine. This doesn't load the module in however, so I force it:\nsudo lsmod | grep nvidia\nsudo modprobe nvidia_331\nsudo lsmod | grep nvidia\n\nand the last lsmod now shows the module is loaded with 0 users of it.\nThen I run:\nsudo /etc/init.d/lightdm start\n\nThis time X comes up with the nvidia splash screen, and then finally the usual ubuntu login screen. Logging into that does bring up my desktop, but without any of the unity trappings such as the icons in the left or the bar on the top or any display manager. A \"System program problem detected\" dialog pops up, but gives me no details as to what it actually is.\nThen when I reboot, it's back to square one where the nvidia driver needs to be reset in jockey and modprobe'ed again - it's not retaining that information. \nClearly nvidia drivers are fragile at the best of times, but any help from people who might have been through this same pain would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: had a sort of similar issue.\n\n\n*\n\n*I am using ubuntu-x-swat ppa (ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates)\n\n*after update to nividia_331, nvidia was not loading on boot\n\n*using sudo modprobe nvidia_331, and then sudo service lightdm start would get everything working (get me into the GUI)\n\n*adding nvidia_331 to /etc/modules solved this, but I am not sure if that is the proper way to do it or not\n\n\nA: For Nvidia + Intel hybrid laptops (uninstall any other driver first) use the following command :\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-319 nvidia-settings-319 nvidia-prime\n\n\nA: I did give up in the end and re-installed 13.10. That restored some sanity, and it reverted to the nouveau driver. I haven't quite had the courage yet to switch to one of the proprietary drivers.

Please help I need for someone to help me creating a plan of attack ; )\nPurpose: Setting up dual booting = Windows 8.1 + Ubuntu 13.10.\nPresent status:\nBoth OSs are installed in a different hard disks, with messed up booting files.\nHow did I get here (short version): \nDays ago I had unplugged the Windows hard disk from the motherboard in order to reinstall Ubuntu, and keep things simple while doing it. It all went well, I ran Ubuntu successfully for about 5 days, after a good number of tweaks here and there I very happy with what I've got. My next step was to fix the Windows booting files.\nUnfortunately I didn't think of unplugging the Ubuntu hard disk this time : ( As you may imagine, this messed up GRUB. \nI was able to fix the MBR with the Win8 Repair startup USB key, using: ''bootrec /fixmbr'', but the following command failed: ''bootrec /fixboot'', it replied: ''The volume does not contain a recognized file system. Please make sure that all required file system drivers are loaded and that the volume is not corrupted''. \nAdditionally, I proceded to try: ''bcdedit /set {default} device partition=c'', but I got this: ''The boot configuration data store could not be opened. The system cannot find the file specified'' \nIt was after this that my GRUB got messed up.\nWhere to now?\nI have Boot Repair Disk, Super Boot Manager, and EasyBCD. Also a USBlive with Ubuntu 13.10.\nAt least for now, I don`t need actual details, but rather a clear layout of steps to take. Please consider what I want to accomplish, and where I am.\nExample: Start by 1. Repairing the Windows booting files, successfully boot into Windows. Then 2. Do the same for Ubuntu: fix GRUB, then boot from a USBlive to run Super Boot Manager to setup the dual boot.\nThe above was just an example, and if anything a wild speculation of what's ahead.\nThanks a trillion guys!\nJDL\n\nA: Windows is very notorious for not allowing other non-windows OSes to exist on the same computer.\nThe steps would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot your computer into Windows setup CD.\n\n*Repair your boot process and MBR.\n\n*Once you verify that you can log into Windows, launch Ubuntu install.\n\n*Ubuntu will recognize that there is Windows and install Grub. It may also ask you to choose the default OS.\n\n*After Ubuntu is installed you can have a dual-boot PC.\n\n\nA: While Mukul's answer will work, it's quite a long process.  I think windows should boot fine if you just switch which MBR your BIOS points to and then do a smart repair of grub:\n\n\n*\n\n*Enter your BIOS settings and change your primary drive to the\nwindows drive.\n\n*Verify windows now boots\n\n*Use Boot Repair Disk to reinstall grub\n\n", "Q: Static and crackling in my HDMI audio? So, I managed to dual boot Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu 13.04. In Ubuntu 13.04, I installed the drivers for my graphics card(AMD HD Radeon 7700 Series, I'm pretty sure it's a 7790 one and Intel HD Graphics 4600 for Motherboard, but this shouldn't be necessary, considering that it's not the motherboard where I have connected the HDMI) for HDMI. I went to System Settings, and then to Sound, selected the HDMI sound option. Now, whenever I play anything that has sound, the audio has static and crackling. It does not play correctly. I tried searching, but all I find is questions in which the HDMI audio is simply not recognized and not playing.\n\nA: I have a ATI R7 260x, the HDMI audio problem was solved when I've had trying two different workarounds together. It's working as designed now. (on Ubuntu 14.10 64-bit)\nFollow the steps below:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the terminal with Ctrl+Alt+t.\n\n*sudo nano /etc/pulse/default.pa\n\n*Replace the line\nload-module module-udev-detect\n\nwith \nload-module module-udev-detect tsched=0\n\nand save file.\n\n*sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf\n\n*Insert options snd-hda-intel vid=8086 pid=8ca0 snoop=0 at the end\nof the file.\n\n*Reboot the PC\n\nA: SOLUTION:\nI finally found a solution to my problem randomly.\nsudo pico /etc/pulse/default.pa\n\nlook for\nload-module module-udev-detect\n\nand add tsched=0\nload-module module-udev-detect tsched=0\n\nThis simple modification fixed all the sound crackling and static on my PC, in Google Chrome, chromium, HTML5 videos, etc etc\n\nA: I've had crackling and static as well and I solved it by first muting microphone input, and secondly changing my sound to 7.1 surround (even though I only have 2 speakers).\n\nA: In case others run into this issue, I've had this come up when installing pipelight on Ubuntu 14.04 with the AMD Catalyst 14.6 drivers using an A10-7800 APU.  \nMy only solution was to remove pipelight, but I had not run into the solution above. It's quite possible pipelight messes something up that this solution fixes.\n\nA: I had this problem in Ubuntu 20.04; the above solution didn't help.\nIt was due to the bug in PulseAudio, as described in https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pulseaudio/+bug/1585084 \nThe solution that worked for me was:\nInstall alsa-tools-gui \nRun hdajackretask \nOverride \"Green Headphone, Front side\" to \"Not connected\" \nOverride \"Pink Mic, Front side\" to \"Headphone\" \nClick \"Apply now\" \nClick \"Install boot override\" to make this permanent \nFrom now on, just plug your headphones in the front microphone jack instead of the front headphone jack...\n", "Q: Making the xinput --set-button-map changes permanent I have a new mouse which runs on bluetooth, but I had to setup the middle mouse button manually using xinput --set-button-map.  This isn't persistent after reboot, so I wrote a small python script to run it automatically after login.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work because there is some delay before the mouse automatically reconnects after login.  \nI thought of just adding some wait into my script, but I'm sure there must be a better way to do this.

Is there way to find out all packages which files got deleted in the location so I can reinstall them?\n% ls -l /var\ntotal 20\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Jan 14 08:26 backups\ndrwxr-xr-x 23 root root 4096 Jan  6 20:26 cache\ndrwxr-xr-x 70 root root 4096 Jan 14 09:26 lib\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    9 Oct 31 17:53 lock -> /run/lock\ndrwxrwsr-x  2 root mail 4096 Oct 17 02:59 mail\nlrwxrwxrwx  1 root root    4 Oct 31 17:53 run -> /run\ndrwxr-xr-x 11 root root 4096 Jan 10 22:06 spool\n\n\nA: The more general, simpler answer first:\nAssuming the dpkg status area is intact, you can determine if any installed packages are missing registered files with something like:\nfor p in $(dpkg-query -f '${Package} ' -W); do\n    dpkg -L $p | grep '^/' | while read file; do\n        [ -e \"$file\" ] || echo \"$p is missing $file\"\n    done\ndone\n\nTo limit the checking to files under /var, you could just change the grep expression:\nfor p in $(dpkg-query -f '${Package} ' -W); do\n    dpkg -L $p | grep '^/var/' | while read file; do\n        [ -e \"$file\" ] || echo \"$p is missing $file\"\n    done\ndone\n\nHowever, this may be of limited utility for you. Partly because most packages in Debian/Ubuntu don't ship many files directly to /var, and also because the dpkg status area I mentioned lives under /var, in /var/lib/dpkg. If anything was deleted from there, your problem gets quite a bit more complicated.\nMost of the data in /var is \"variable data\"; \"spool directories and files, administrative and logging data, and transient and temporary files\" according to the FHS. So much of it, if not most, won't come back even if you reinstall all the packages. But by the same token, your system can probably still work pretty well without it.\nThe most important data in /var is your own data; this may be database contents, mail, crontabs, and such. Most of that will be under /var/lib, /var/mail, /var/spool, and /var/local, and /var/opt. If that sort of data has been deleted then you might just need to hope for good backups. Of typically less importance are the system logs in /var/log. If those are gone, obviously you've lost some ability to diagnose past problems, but everything should still work. The remaining most common directories in /var, (/var/backups, /var/cache, /var/run, /var/lock, /var/tmp; some of those may be symlinks to /run or elsewhere) you shouldn't need to worry about; data there should be regenerateable by the owning application.\nFinally, if you haven't restarted your system or the system daemons since the accidental delete operation, some of the files that appear to be deleted may still be hanging around invisibly, held open by some process. The lsof tool can help you find those, and you can retrieve files like that by copying them from /proc/$pid/fd/$fdnumber.\n\nA: I would go in a simpler approach. \nRemember that you have a mirror (a cache, actually) of all your installed packages in \n/var/cache\n\nSo if you want to restore programs and configs, then just enter to the cache and reinstall the stuff in there. Of course, this will work only if you didn't installed anything that broke your system preciously AND if you didn't deleted your apt packages cache (why would you do something like that!?). \nIf that's the case, I'll go for:\ncd /var/cache/apt/archives/\n\nsudo apt-get install *.deb\n\nAgain, you should do this only if your system worked OK before deleting the stuff. \nAnyway, you will find all the installed packages in that location reconfiguring your setting as in the first install (so you will get programs + configs, despite the comment below). \n", "Q: Frequently slow interface on Ubuntu 12.10, 12.04, .

A brief insight into the package contents showed that there are driver sources and installation script inside.\n\nA: Despite containing source code, any \".deb\" qualifies as a \"binary\" package (making it less obvious that it can be uploaded as-is to launchpad). \nBy \"decompile\" I think you mean obtaining the files needed to produce the source packages (.dsc and .changes mainly) to upload to your PPA, so the package builds on the PPA.\nYou can't directly do this as the debian/control file included in the .deb contains only information pertaining the binary package, not the source package (the Source section was removed when building the binary). If you know enough about debian packaging, you could recreate the source section and test locally before uploading to your PPA.\nHowever, if your systems are able to reach the PPA, there's no reason why they couldn't simply download and install the provided .deb file as-is, which is what I would suggest you do, assuming you're unable to just upgrade to Ubuntu 13.10 as others have mentioned.\n", "Q: Chromium hacked?

The top panel and launcher are at one of the highest levels of the window stack, so will always appear on top of things, which are not full-screen application windows.\n\nA: By default,the colours of your launcher and panel mimic the colour of your desktop wallpaper.I am assuming you are asking how to change that.\nIf you don't already have it,install the compiz settings manager using\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nOnce installed,use the dash to launch it.\nClick on the category Desktop.\nClick on Ubuntu Unity Plugin.\nYou will see an option called panel opacity.Try changing it to a higher value.You can can then click on laucher option and increase the laucher opacity as well.higher the opacity,less the colour will resemble that of the wallpaper.I hope this answers your question.\nit could also be that the resolution of the wallpaper you are trying to use isn't right.To find the resolution that will work best for your monitor,check the resolution of your default ubuntu wallpapers(you can see that under appearances).\n", "Q: what is \"make png\" command for?

I no longer want to do so; I want these folders unencrypted as before. How do I remove the folders from encfs control? \nThx\n\nA: First, I need to explain how encfs works. It basically uses 2 folders:\n\n\n*\n\n*a rootdir folder where the encrypted data is stored (for example ~/encfs/.encrypted). It is a fully normal folder, just the data can't be read directly.\n\n*a mountPoint folder where the decrypted data is visible. This is the one you use (for example ~/encfs/clear). It is not a typical folder, more similar to a thumb drive.\n\n\nEvery modification that you make in the mountPoint is encrypted by encfs in the rootdir.\nIf you want to remove the data from encfs' control, you just need to move the files out of the mountPoint to another folder. Encfs will just consider that you have removed the data and will delete the corresponding files from the rootdir.\nThen you probably want to get rid of the rootdir and mountPoint folders. The first step is to unmount the mountPoint:\nfusermount -u ~/encfs/clear\n\nAfter that, only the rootdir will remain. You can then simply remove the emptied (good idea to check first if it's really empty) folder ~/encfs/.encrypted.\n", "Q: after installing ubuntu windows is not showing in grub Recently for one project I installed 64-bit Ubuntu (initially it was Ubuntu 32-bit) in my college lab machine.\nBut the problem is after installing 64-bit it is not showing me the windows in grub while booting and that windows is genuine which was purchased by my college(For my own machine I don't need windows ). \nI tried many things to update it's grub but no result found.

I'm trying for several days now to solve my problem. I have been using openvpn for windows for quite a while and after replacing windows with ubuntu 13.10, I was happy to see that openvpn is available for ubuntu as well.\nI copied my settings from windows and in /var/log/syslog I see that my connection is successfully created. However, no matter what I do, I'm unable to set routes.\nIn windows, this was simply done by script that worked as follows (ip addresses slightly differ since I have to keep them private):\nc:\\windows\\system32\\route.exe delete 55.78.16.20\nc:\\windows\\system32\\route.exe delete 55.78.16.0\ndel tmp.cmd\nc:\\windows\\system32\\route.exe print | grep.exe -m1 \"^ *0.0.0.0\" | sed.exe s/\\x20\\x20*/\\t/g | cut.exe -f4 | sed \"s/.*/c:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\route.exe add 55.78.16.20 mask 255.255.255.255 &/\" > tmp.cmd\nc:\\windows\\system32\\route.exe print | grep \"^ *172.16.0.1\" | sed s/\\x20\\x20*/\\t/g | cut -f4 | sed \"s/.*/c:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\route.exe add 55.78.16.0 mask 255.255.255.0 &/\" >> tmp.cmd\ntmp.cmd\n\nAfter connection was set and above script was executed, connections to my servers went through VPN, while all other went normally.\nSince this script uses grep, sed and cut, I figured I can easily \"translate\" it to linux. And I did it, except for the fact that I'm a bit unsure how to use route command to set my connection properly.\nP.S. I also tried setting VPN using network manager, but the same question appears: how to add routes?\nThx in advance\n\nA: On OpenVPN you can accomplish this in three ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Server pushes the route to ALL the clients.  You do this by putting the route command in the server.conf file, on the server\n\n*Server pushes the route to a single client.  You do this by putting the route command in a client-specific file in what's known as the client-config folder on the server\n\n*Client sets up the route.  You do this by putting the route into your client config (ovpn on windows) file\n\n\nIn all three cases it looks like this:\nroute [routeaddress] [netmask]\n\ni.e.\nroute 172.92.3.0 255.255.0.0\n\nConsult this page for details.  \nhttp://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto.html\n\nA: First and foremost:\nYou have been using GNU tools on windows? Like WTH man.\nSecond:\nBasically you have two ways to achieve the same thing.\nThe first is to use the ip command. You would do something like ip route add .... though I'm kinda oldschool and dislike ip so I'm not too sure about how would you do  that but man ip will certainly help you there.\nThe second is to use the older route command. With this you can modify the kernel's routing table. Issuing man route will pretty much tell you what you need to do, but for the sake of completeness it should be something like route add <target IP you want to reach> <interface that you want the target to be reached>. You can set the target IP to entire subnets, but then you will have to add in a gateway for that too. (And set up a route to that gateway.)\nOh and you can check your interfaces with both ip and ifconfig.\nLet me know how it works out for you.\n", "Q: Asus WiFi Driver for 13.10 (requires patch to work with kernel 3.11) I am new to Ubuntu and need help installing a WiFi driver for a ASUS PCE n53 wireless card.\nI have read the instructions on the install disk and could not understand what I am to do.\nI have also read a bunch of the posts about how to install it and that it needs a patch to work.

As 17.10 will come out in October 16.04 solutions will be more and more obsolete. Two possible solutions for Zesty users:\n\n\n*\n\n*Simpler: just use a static build https://www.johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/\n\n*More work: install the vid.stab from github (https://github.com/georgmartius/vid.stab read the compile instructions, very simple), and then compile ffmpeg https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Ubuntu\nSince I don't have too much time, I like the first solution, worked flawlessly.\nThe vidstab first pass works on 1 core only, but since my GoPro footage is in many chunks, I could process 4 video simultaneously if I'd want 100% system load. The second pass utilizes all 4 cores.\nMy laptop i7-6820HK but both passes only progress with about 0.12x speed.

Currently only 19.04 Disco Dingo and newer provides this package. Alternatively, 16.04 Xenial Xerus users can use the libvidstab-dev package from the mc3man PPA).\nTo compile libvidstab:\n$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake\n$ mkdir ~/ffmpeg_sources ~/ffmpeg_build\n$ cd ~/ffmpeg_sources\n$ wget -O https://github.com/georgmartius/vid.stab/archive/master.zip\n$ unzip master.zip\n$ cd vid.stab-master\n$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=~/ffmpeg_build .\n$ make\n$ make install\n\nNow follow How to Compile FFmpeg on Ubuntu.

I purchased VPN service from PrivateInternetAccess.com.  It works fine but only when the Cipher and HMAC Authentication under the advanced settings are set to \"default\".  When I run this VPN service on Mac and Windows I am able to adjust these settings.  But in Ubuntu 13.04 any setting changes from \"default\" results in a connection failure.\nWhat are these \"default\" settings for the Cipher and HMAC?\nWhy can't I change them?\n\nA: Works as designed\nCipher and HMAC settings must match the server settings exactly in OpenVPN. There's no negotiation in any way on those. I cannot elaborate on why it does work on another OS, but having different settings on client and server should not work.\nIf you need other HMAC and Cipher settings you'll have to change the server settings as well. In your case in which you purchase a service you don't have control over the server settings.

Before I installed Ubuntu I was using \"Windows 7 Home Premium\" which ran pretty laggy. So I decided using Ubuntu. I took a bootable USB with Ubuntu 12.04 and dropped the Win 7 OS of my eee PC. The Eee PC doesn't have a disk drive included. Ubuntu runs the way I expected, superior!\nRight now I wanna open My Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe InDesign files to edit my projects. In Ubuntu with Wine, I am unable to install the CS3, CS4 or CS5 ISOs cause they split up after mounting.

You can get around this by opening another file and changing its size to what you need, but it's hacky and I wouldn't recommend it at all.\nIf you want more info on this you can check out creative-cloud-linux which allows installation from the Adobe CC app.\nIf instead you want to use wine, which I recommend, the WineHQ page has everything you need to set it up and all you need is a Windows pc with Photoshop already installed on it.\nThe WineHQ guide is a bit unclear and might confuse new users however.\nWhen you're told to run \nwinetricks fontsmooth=rgb gdiplus vcrun2008 vcrun2010 vcrun2012 vcrun2013 vcrun2015 msxml3 msxml6 gdiplus corefonts\n\nthe guide actually means you should run:\nWINEPREFIX=/path/to/directory winetricks fontsmooth=rgb gdiplus vcrun2008 vcrun2010 vcrun2012 vcrun2013 vcrun2015 msxml3 msxml6 gdiplus corefonts\n\nIf that step is skipped, photoshop will still run but it will be missing fonts and most functions will be broken. \nEdit: The wine guide also says you should download \"amtlib\" with the above command. I suspect this is used for cracking Photoshop. Either way the download doesn't work, and keeping it in the command will stop corefonts, msxml3, msxml6 and gdiplus from installing. Make sure you use the above command and not the one on the guide.\n[I hope it's okay for me to answer such an old question, I saw that it had a lot of views but no definitive answer so I gave it a go]\n", "Q: Can't use RStudio any more after trying to set up an ODBC connection to a postgreSQL database I tried to Setup an odbc connection from R to my PostgreSQL database located on a server (package RODBC).

(I've searched a lot and found nothing).\n\nA: OK I finally figured this out - this is probably just as relevant for Ubuntu users as it is for any Linux distro so I'll give my solution here should anyone else have the same issue.\nThe fix was simple.\n\n\n*\n\n*boot into OSX\n\n*modify /EFI/refind/refind.conf to enable gptsync (showtools gptsync)\n\n*reboot back to the refind boot menu\n\n*choose \"Start Hybrid MBR tool\" and allow it to alter the MBR to what it detects\n\n*rejoice that your windows partition now boots once again.\n\n\nAt step (2) you need to uncomment the modify the 'showtools' line (uncomment or add as needed) to list:\nshowtools gptsync\n\nNow, I just need to work out how to have 1 entry for my Fedora boot item instead of the 5 that rEFInd finds and shows.\n", "Q: No files in /etc/skel/ ; Can't restore .bashrc I recently messed up my .bashrc file, which I mentioned in this question: How do I restore .bashrc to its default?, and I can't find a way to restore .bashrc to its default that works.\nI can't make commands in the terminal because every time I try I receive an error message along the lines of \n\nThe command could not be located because '/usr/bin' is not included in the PATH >environment variable.\n\nOn other questions I have seen that some recommendations for this problem involve using default files in /etc/skel/ (Problem in .bashrc ).\nThis won't work for me, as I looked in /etc/skel/, and realized that I have practically no files at all in there! I don't know why this is.\nAlso, solutions that involve using the terminal don't seem to work because every time I use the terminal I get the above-mentioned error message.\nI'd be really appreciative if anybody could help me solve this problem. I'm somewhat new to Ubuntu, and I'm having difficulties with this issue. \n\nA: Usually .bashrc file on /etc/skel/ was hidden.Press ctrl+h to see the hidden .bashrc file.\n\nA: Most of the default files in /etc/skel are hidden ('dot') files, so to see them in the GUI file manager you will need to Show hidden files from the menu or use the Ctrl+h key combination.\nTo see them in a terminal you will need to use ls -a or ls -A i.e.\nls /etc/skel\nexamples.desktop\n\nbut\n$ ls -A /etc/skel\n.bash_logout  .bashrc  examples.desktop  .profile  .Xdefaults  .xscreensaver\n\nUntil you have fixed your path you will need to use the full path to each command e.g. /bin/ls,  /bin/cp e.g.\n/bin/cp ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc_old\n/bin/cp /etc/skel/.bashrc ~/\n\nFor the new .bashrc file to take effect, you will need to start a new shell or log out and back in - or you can source the new file in the shell using\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\n", "Q: Thunar doesn't save settings on exit Every time I reboot my system,  Thunar loses its settings for view, window dimensions, column widths, etc, and reverts to its installation defaults.\nI'm on Ubuntu 13.10 64bit, Thunar 1.6.3.\nIs there a way to make it remember its settings?\n\nA: I had a similar issue, though, only my set-up column width in Detailed View didn't get used permanently.\nFor me, changing the permissions (was 700) for the folder ~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml wasn't the solution. Thunar's settings got saved correctly with every switching of View mode or changing of column width. Still, every new Thunar window opened with a default column layout. Even setting permissions of ~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/thunar.xml to read-only after verifying the correctly saved settings in the XML's entry last-details-view-column-widths did not fix the issue; the file permissions were even reset once Thunar was restarted.\nFor me, the solution was to uncheck the setting Automatically expand columns as needed in Thunar's menu View\" > Configure Columns.... This setting seems to work in a faulty manner, as even when opening a folder that has only one-letter items, the \"Name\" column was opened with a width of about 600 pixels, pushing columns such as \"Type\" and \"Date Modified\" out of view in a window 1100 Pixels wide, so I still had to scroll horizontally to see those columns.\nAfter unchecking above setting, Thunar opens all windows and folders with the column layout I set up.\n\nA: Looking and asking around, at the end I found the error:  I didn't have permissions to acces the folder ~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml.\nSo, to be sure that the files and folders have the correct permissions, I executed this commands:\nchmod 755 $HOME/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml\n\nAt the restart all work properly.\nEDIT: Recursively chmod'ing /home/username to 755 as a whole is potentially dangerous, especially on multi-user machines! There are various files and folders within your $HOME that are and should be readable only to your own user. Hence the edit to chmod only the relevant directory.\n", "Q: bios_grub partition in the way of resizing Ubuntu partition I tried to grow the ext4 partition by shrinking sda4 and then adding the unallocated partition to the ext4 partition, where Ubuntu lives.\nThe selected partition, sda6 (see image), contains the bios_grub so I need to move that one. GPartEd however, won't let me.\nI have \"boot repair disk\" on a DVD, so I figured if I just 'simply delete' sda6, assign the unallocated space to the ext4 partition and then booting into \"boot repair disk\" would make everything work like it should.\n\nI need some help in this, because I need the extra space. Nothing has been done yet, I'm at the point the above image depicts.\n\nA: *\n\n*Simply delete /dev/sda6.\n\n*Then right-click on the dev/sda7 ext4 partition to add the unallocated space 97.71 GB+1 MB to the ext4 partition.\n\n*Finally ran boot-repair.\nNote: Please make sure that the partitions which you are going to resize should be unmounted.\n", "Q: Git - URL does not appear to be a git repository I just started using Git and now I'm experiencing a problem.\nI have a production server and a local development repository. All files on my local master branch should be on the production server. So after every change on the master branch I push to the production server. First time, all files should be pushed obviously.\nI created a repository on the server and got this message Initialized empty Git repository in /var/www/my_really_cool_project/.git/. Then I added the remote on the local machine, but whenever pushing it logs '181.910.139.164/var/wwww/my_really_cool_project/.git' does not appear to be a git repository. I probably made a mistake in the URL but I have no idea what the problem is. Connection via SSH goes via port 4938.\nIs anyone able to tell me what the problem is here? I'm really stuck on this. \nThis is the output of git remote show origin:\nfatal: '181.910.139.164/var/wwww/my_really_cool_project/.git' does not appear to be a git repository\nfatal: Could not read from remote repository.\n\nPlease make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.\n\n\nA: gertvdijk's suggestion was right.\nInstead of 181.910.139.164/var/wwww/my_really_cool_project/.git I should have used 181.910.139.164:/var/wwww/my_really_cool_project/.git. As you can see I added a colon.\n", "Q: Why is Samba on Ubuntu Server not asking for a password? I have looked at other answers on the web and on this site, but most of them seem to be for people who want to use Samba without a password.  We have a mostly Windows 7 network.  We set up Samba on our Ubuntu Server machine.  Here are the relevant parts of the config file:\nworkgroup = our.windows.domain\nsecurity = user\n[sharename]\ncomment = my share\npath = /home/myuser\nbrowsable = yes\nguest ok = no\nread only = no\ncreate mask = 0755\n\nAfter making these changes to the config file and trying to connect the first time, I got in without a password.  Anyone on our local network can mount the share \\1.2.3.4\\sharename without being asked for a password.  I want it to ask me for the Linux username and password.  What step have I missed?  Is there any other info you need to help me?\nThanks in advance!\nJeremy\n\nA: By default, Windows will supply the local user's credentials when connecting to a network share. You have configured a Windows domain, so presumably users would use the same credentials to log on to their workstations and to connect to the Samba share. Thus the above behavior on a Windows client is normal.\n", "Q: Can not login to Ubuntu 13.10 after reboot For some reason on my System76 Bonobo, after a reboot, i try to login and I get a blinking cursor in the top left for a few seconds, than right back to the login screen. It SEEMS like lightdm crashes. I did several things, most of which are outlined in google searches and include reinstalling ubuntu-desktop package, resetting unity...etc. The strange part is that I can login to the guest account just fine. However, I can NOT login to a newly created account, same result as my account. I AM able to ctrl+alt+F1 and login, than startx. This gets me to an empty desktop with no launcher...etc. I am able to get the launcher back by using the compiz-configuration-manager app and choosing \"Enable Ubuntu Unity Plugin\", however, than I have an empty panel (no icons or date/time).\nIt seems like an audio issue, because when i finally am back in by doing startx and compiz reset, and goto system settings, i only see \"Dummy output\" as an option and have no audio.

I have tried repairing gnome-desktop-*, /etc/fstab , unity, compiz, lightdm, gdm ...nothing works. But when I use unity in terminal, it told me something wrong with fglrx. No such device. fglrx is an library package for optimization of ATI graphical card. My card is very old and can't match this driver. I should not install it at all. After I run sudo apt-get purge fglrx in tty and reboot, the desktop run up again!\nSo I suggest you check the driver for your graphical card. I saw something mismatch in the log.

I've developed the glade front-end and able to connect the various signals. Now, I'm facing only one issue which is to create the 'sudo' interface.\nFor some reasons, we don't want the user to start the program using gksu, but instead provide him a password dialog that is later stored in the program (similar to what happens with synaptic package manager).\nTrouble is that the script works fine when I tested on GNOME 3 desktop where I developed it, but on ubuntu the gksu command is not saving anything to keyring. Instead, it asks password for each command! Here is the function in the program that calls gksu:\ndef execute(command,errorstring='', wait = True, shellexec = True):\n    try:\n        print 'command=' + command\n        p=subprocess.Popen(\"gksu '\" + command + \"'\", shell=shellexec,stdout=subprocess.PIPE,stderr=subprocess.PIPE)\n        if wait:\n            p.wait()\n            result=get_stdout(p)\n            return result\n        else:\n            print 'not waiting'\n            return p\n    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:\n        print 'error occured:' + errorstring\n        return errorstring\n\nAnd here is an example of how I call the execute function in some parts of my program:\n#stop hostapd if already running.\nif is_process_running('hostapd')>0:\n    writelog('stopping hostapd')\n    **execute('killall hostapd')**\n\n#enable forwarding in sysctl.\nwritelog('enabling forward in sysctl.')\nset_sysctl('net.ipv4.ip_forward','1')\n\nHow do I go about it so that the gksu call stores password in the keyring or something and doesn't bother user each time ?\n\nA: Not sure about this, but probably you'll need to disable the option \"tty_tickets\" in /etc/sudoers. Normally the \"grace period\" of sudo not asking for a password again is bound to the tty, see the manual.\nWarning --- this could be a security threat.\nBasically you should add to the option\nDefaults   !tty_tickets\n\nin your /etc/sudoers files (you know how to do it, otherwise better no doing it). A lot of info is found in the arch linux wiki. Notice that after that, during the grace period, all the user applications can gain privileges without asking for a password...\nThe other strategy is to request the whole script to be run under sudo. If you are worried about running all time with root privileges, you can drop them and use them only when needed using os.seteuid().\nInteresting links here and here.\nAnother strategy is to make the program setuid (you have to use some trick to do it, see the links in the answer --- it's for bash, the same stands for python), and then use for example groups if you want to restrict the access to the user (or drop privileges and then re-enable it after asking for a password).\n", "Q: How do I resolve a 401 error when setting up Juju MAAS environment?

But there is seeding activity (around 160KB/s). \nI re-checked the port with an online site. It says closed too. How is that possible?? \nI forgot to add that I use Ubuntu 12.04 and I enabled Upnp both in Transmission and in the router's interface.  \nCould seeding happen even if the port is closed? \n\nA: To open the port, you need to work at two levels, computer and modem router:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Transmission and go in Edit -> Preferences -> Network\n\n*Copy the port number (eg. 51414)\n\n*Check \"Use UPnP or NAT-PMP port forwarding from my router\"\n\n\n*Open a terminal and, as root, give the following command to open the\nport in the firewall permanently:\n$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=51414/tcp\n\n*Now the last step, that is the manual configuration of your modem\nrouter, by opening a web browser at your IP address (check the previous guide\nto find out it: it could be 192.168.1.100, or 192.168.1.1, or 192.168.178.1, or something else)\n\n*For FRITZ!Box 7490 modem router, for example, you need to go in\nInternet -> Permit Access => select a device => now click on New\nSharing or, if you have olready one, click on the edit icon to add a\nnew forwarding => New permit access -> as application choose other\napplication to enter a custom name -> as protocol choose TCP -> then\nas port 51414 in all the three fields => OK => OK => Apply\n\n*Now test Transmission, going in Edit -> Preferences -> Network ->\nCheck port => OPEN!\n\n\nA: The short answer to the question: YES, you can seed with closed port too.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the port is closed that only means you can't accept incoming connections, but you can still connect to peers who accept connections. In torrent terminology they say that you are in passive mode.\n\n*If your port would be open then you would be able to accept connections too. In torrent terminology this is called active mode.\nSo it works like this: A client in passive mode can connect to a client which is in active mode, but not to a client which is in passive mode. A client in active mode can connect to both active and passive clients. \nSo if your port is closed that only means you can't connect to other peers with closed ports. That means that you may get less peers and because of that worse speed. But if the torrent is frequent and there are lot of peers your client will likely be able to find enough active peers to max out your connection. If the torrent has few peers then it is likely that with active mode you would get much better speed. (If that rare case happens that all the peers are in passive mode, then you won't be able to download/upload anything. Actually non of the peers would be able to do anything as everyone is passive, you will have to wait until an active peer comes in.) \n\nTo open that port: First find out the number of the port in Transmission under Edit->Preferences->Network->Port used for incoming connections. That port can be blocked either by your router or by your firewall. \n\n\n*\n\n*If you use Ubuntu with the default settings and didn't activate a firewall then the linux firewall won't block any port. If you activated some kind of firewall then you have to change those settings to allow incoming connections on that port. If you use a firewall but you don't know how to allow that port, use the following command where PORT_NUMBER is the port used for incoming connections in Transmission:\nsudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport PORT_NUMBER -j ACCEPT\n\nthis is only a temporary solution, after reboot this firewall setting is lost. If you want to make it permanent you can put this command in a startup script. (But it is better if you allow the port in your firewall frontend (ufw, gufw, firestarter, e.g.) for permanent solution.)\n\n*So the much more likely case is that your router is \"blocking\" that port:\nThe easier way to solve this is to just enable UPnP in the router's settings and also in Transmission under Edit->Preferences->Network tab-> and check in Use UPNP or NAT-PMP port-forwarding from my router.\nIf that doesn't solve it then you will have to forward that port in the router's settings. Here is a great site showing you how to do that for almost all types of router. Just select your router type there and follow the instructions. (On that site you will also have to select a program for which you want to forward, but it is unimportant which one you choose, because the solution will only differ in the port number, but you already know from transmission the port number which you want to forward.) \nNote: You should only check Pick a random port every time Transmission is started in Transmission if you use UPNP, or the port number will always change and the firewall/forwarding have to be set up after every start of transmission. (UPNP can deal with changing port numbers.)\n", "Q: Amount of Space required for Ubuntu I am about to partition my laptop for Ubuntu. I already have BackTrack partitioned on my computer. However, I recently heard that Linux does not need much space when partitioning because it will use other partitions for more space? Is this true?\n\nA: It is kind of true. But you want to be careful while doing this.\nYou can install Ubuntu on a partition as small as 4GB to run the OS and its essentials. Ubuntu / Linux can mount different partitions at mount points and work with NTFS partitions as well. If you have a windows data partition formatted with NTFS that you use for storing data, then you could make an entry in FSTAB to mount that partition in your Ubuntu at boot time.\nHowever I will advise extreme caution if your Windows partition is system partition and contain Windows system files and boot partition before doing this.\n\nA: Optimal disk space is cca 10 Gb and SWAP.\n\nA: it depends what is the use of your Ubuntu.\nLinux can mount other partitions and read and store information on them. But, To be able to do this and make it work. Your level in Linux should be pretty good. \nAs a beginner i would start with 20 GB.\n", "Q: Chromium Kiosk ALMOST done I have a 12.04 system here with a chromium kiosk.

I would like to replace the former with the latter without having to reinstall everything. What I found after a bit of research was to use a live disk + an external hard drive + gparted to copy the whole Linux partition (in two steps) and then edit fstab. \nNow I guess when Linux is installed, it assesses computer's hardware and therefore adjusts some software parameters. So I'm afraid doing the above may 'fool' the OS and result in sub-optimal performance w.r.t. the SSD. I don't know if this is right.\n\nA: When changing hardware, it's a good idea to worry about how the OS will react. For most things, you can just change the piece of hardware in the innards of your computer, then let Linux do it's magic.\nHard drives are a little different. You may copy all files, but still need to have boot instructions (grub) installed on your new drive. You also need to make sure that the identifier of your new drive matches the old one (or some drivers will be lost at sea).\nOnce the UUID is changed, you boot through a live-cd, copy all your precious files on your SSD, and chroot on you new drive to create the bootloader (grub).\nI was going to go in details on how to do such things, but while doing a little research on the topic, I found this: http://blog.oaktreepeak.com/2012/03/move_your_linux_installation_t.html\nThat being said, is it a good idea? Ideally, you should reinstall from scratch. It would give the opportunity to clean all the broken files that on your drive. If you really don't want to lose your settings for all different applications, make sure you copy all hidden files in your home folder, and transfer them to your new install. If you migrate from one distro to another with the same packages, it will be no issue.\nHowever, if time is a constraint, copying from one hard drive to another is fine, as long as you set all references from your old hard drive \"pointed at\" the new one. As with anything, it does have a chance to fail, but if you make backups, there is no problem with copying a drive onto another.\n\nA: Linux is not windows. You don't really need to worry about such things. You can just create a raw partition using dd. And after fixing UUIDs you should be just fine.\n", "Q: Unable to edit using vi I'm trying to edit my /etc/network/interfaces file to add a line for a proxy server.

I've tried hitting both \"insert\" and \"i\" on my keyboard, which should work for vi.  What gives?  And what am I doing wrong?\n\nA: You are doing nothing wrong. You just don't know how to use vim. \nVim is an editor that works differently from any other editor. If you want to understand how it works, open a terminal in full screen and type vimtutor. It will teach you how to use vim inside vim.\n\nA: If you're dissatisfied with the complexities of using vi, try using nano text editor, which is included in the default Ubuntu installation.

The only two nano keyboard shortcuts that you need to know are for WriteOut and Exit.\n\n\n*\n\n*Press the keyboard combination Ctrl+O and after that press Enter to save the file being edited in nano to its current location. \n\n*Press the keyboard combination Ctrl+X to exit nano.\nTo edit the /etc/network/interfaces file from the terminal type:\nsudo nano /etc/network/interfaces  \n\n", "Q: Why can't I use `su --session-command` on Ubuntu? In trying to solve a problem, I discovered the --session-command argument to su, as documented here. I tried to use it on my Ubuntu 12.04 system at work, but got an 'unrecognized option' error. Sure enough, it doesn't even show up on the man page for su!\nThe linked manpage does say --session-command is 'discouraged' but doesn't say why.\nOut of curiosity, I connected to a CentOS 6.2. server at my work, and --session-command is recognized.\nFurther research led me to discover that the su used by Ubuntu comes from the login package, whereas in CentOS it comes from coreutils. Ubuntu also has a coreutils package installed by default, but it doesn't contain the FSF's standard su implementation. A detailed comparison shows that coreutils from both distros contain 105 executable files, but there are several differences (most of which seem to just be the installed location of the files).\nMy question: Is --session-command left out of Ubuntu's (or Debian's) superuser command by design, or has Ubuntu's divergent implementation simply not caught up with FSF? If by design, what is the reasoning for the omission? Related question: Why not use all the FSF's GNU Utils, anyway? \nI'm sure this is documented somewhere but google was not forthcoming, given my search criteria.\n\nA: Ubuntu and Debian uses the shadow-utils package since a worthwhile (log file goes to 01 Jan 1996). The util-linux su was moved from coreutils to util-linux package recently, the version in coreutils needed to be specifically build with it (most distros didn't). Apparently the only reason is that Debian always used shadow-util own implementation instead of coreutils su.\n\nThe header you will notice a message saying that there's another man page provided by the shadow-utils package which is the same as Debian/Ubuntu uses. If you see the bottom of the man page if both Ubuntu and CentOS you will notice this too.\nIn summary you are reading the wrong man.\n", "Q: How to mount network drive so that it can be used from applications and on wifi I wish to set up a network drive for storing my personal photos. I already have a server and a 'pictures' user on the server. I planned to store the photos in the home directory of this user.\nI already tried to set up an sshfs mount in fstab but that didn't quite work. I believe the reason was that my laptop is currently only on wifi and fstab would have required wired connection even when using _netdev option. \nThen I saw this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=896474&p=5635104#post5635104 which adds mounting scripts to network if-up and if-down. But for some reason even that didn't work. When wifi connection was created the if-up script was not run.\nThen I tried to use the \"Connect to server\" in Nautilus. This looked very promising and it sort of works. Only down side is that places connected with that option do not show up in browsers upload file dialog. And it would be one of the main use cases that I attach a picture to an email.\nSo my question is how could I mount a network drive so that:\n1) the drive would be usable from applications like browser\n2) it is automatically connected when network is available or when the bookmark or directory in Nautilus is clicked\n3) Can be used by multiple users\n4) easy to use even by nontechnical persons (setup can be more demanding)\nIs there such a way?\n\nA: Then I tried to use the \"Connect to server\" in Nautilus. This looked very promising and it sort of works. Only down side is that places connected with that option do not show up in browsers upload file dialog\nNautilus mounts those files under ~/.gvfs/share_name and they are available in the browsers upload file dialog from that directory too. Maybe the dialog hides that folder, because it is hidden, just press CTRL+H in the dialog to toggle showing hidden files/directories and browse to that folder.\nTo mount the same way as Nautilus mounts just use the command \ngvfs-mount \"ssh://user@host:port\"\n\n(Obviously filling out the parts correctly.) You can make a simple bash script with that command:\n#!/bin/bash\nsleep 20\ngvfs-mount \"ssh://user@host:port\"\n\nmake it executable and make that script autostart with your login. (e.g. by typing \"startup\" in Dash and using the \"startup applications\" app to set it up.) This script will wait 20 seconds after startup to mount the share, if you need more or less time for the wifi to come up just change the number in the script to the seconds you want.\n", "Q: Slim down Ubuntu server 12.04 I know Ubuntu server is already slimmed down, but... We're deploying a custom configured Ubuntu Server as an OVA. The size of the .vmdk file inside the OVA is 700+ MB (basically thats the bare bones default Ubuntu Server 12.04 install). Our VM does a VERY basic task and doesn't need a lot of other things present in the operating system. Can someone help us slim down the Ubuntu server to below bare minimum. I'm talking about removing things like man pages, and other parts of the OS that are not critical to our environment.\n* UPDATE *\nEven going as far as removing things like extra shell environments (not sure if you can safely do that). We want to remove everything that wont break the OS from booting and running Java. Maybe we dont need commands like fdisk etc. Anywhere we can save space will reduce the size of the OVA which will speed up the download for customers.\nThanks\n\nA: Perhaps building it from the minimal build upwards would be a better option.\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD\nThis way you only have the dependencies that are necessary and don't have to keep track of the dependencies that some packages may rely on when removing other packages.\nSomething similar would be to start with the core and build it up as needed.\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/Core/InstallationExample\nJust a thought.\n\nA: If you're building an appliance (that it's likely nobody will actually have to use - from a command line perspective), you could just start with a Ubuntu Minimal install (about 80M last time I tried, if I remember correctly) and just install the packages you need.\nThis will omit all sorts of packages (including things like nano and bash completion) so it can be quite a disorientating to newer users.\nI'd also suggest liberal use of --no-install-recommends with your apt-get commands. And run an apt-get clean before you take your image.\n\nThere are two ways of arriving at a \"minimal\" installation:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use the Minimal CD. This is basically a partitioner and a download mechanism. It needs to download everything. If you're installing quite a bit, this can be slower than using an ISO... But it should mean you start off with fresh packages.\n\n*You can use the standard Ubuntu Server CD to do a minimal install. This might be more useful in a low-bandwidth environment but it'll need updating straight after install.\n\n\n\nI wouldn't recommend knocking into coreutils though. There'll be a ton of commands in there that you think you'll never need but they account for kilobytes. All sorts of stuff relies on these commands which is why the kernel packages depend on it.\n", "Q: Do I need to create partitions in advance for Kubuntu installation if I have unallocated space?

I just migrated to Ubuntu 13.10 from Windows.\nWhile using Windows, it is a common practice to download a software, save the downloaded files in a different partition and then use the executable .exe installer to install the software in the computer.\nI have been installing apps in Ubuntu using \nsudo apt-get install <package-name>\n\nIn this process I am unable to store a copy of the software before installing. Is there a process for doing that? Ubuntu doesn't even ask me for the path where to download the software to. Neither am I asked for a path where the OS wants to install the software.\nI am unable to understand the process that is going on.\n\nA: Linux software is organized in packages, and apt is the software that manages those packages. A software package may depend on many other software packages in order to run. For example, if you install the package for Wine, apt will report that wine depends on several other packages, which in turn depend on other packages that do certain things for Wine, like fonts, filesystem utilities, filetype support, etc. \nOrganizing software this way has many advantages.\n\n\n*\n\n*There is no need to install a piece of software twice.\n\n*It is incredibly easy to remove and install packages because it is all automated.\n\n*Removing software is always non-invasive.\n\n*Upgrading software is a breeze.\n\n*There is no need to keep track of a bunch of downloaded executable installer files.\nIn Windows, you would have one big folder for a program holding all the software binaries, icons, configuration files, and the whole blob for a specific program. In Linux, you have a dedicated folder for all the icons the system uses (/usr/share/icons), all the binaries (/bin), all the firmware files (/lib/firmware), and the rest. The package file for a piece of software keeps track of all of its files across the system. Things are a lot easier to find this way.\nWhen you install a package, this is what happens: Say you invoke the command sudo apt-get install libreoffice:\n\n\n*\n\n*The package lists on your computer (in /var/lib/apt/lists) are checked for a package named libreoffice. The lists provide information about all of the different installable packages, which are stored on http://archive.ubuntu.com/. The website is not meant to be browsed by users (see below), instead it's intended to be used by apt. The package's dependencies are examined (in libreoffice's case the list is extensive). If dependencies need to be installed, they are added to the list of packages to be installed, in the correct order.\n\n*The packages are all downloaded from http://archive.ubuntu.com/. If you have selected a different mirror to get more speed, they are downloaded from there.\n\n*The package files themselves are ar achives which in turn contain archives for program data, and information on where the data goes with more detailed information about the package. The packages are decompressed individually and then set up according to what is detailed in the package's control information in the archive. Any specific scripts are then run and configuration files are changed.\n\n*Meanwhile, apt keeps track of the status of the packages: whether they are installed, partially installed, or not installed.\n\n\nIf you want to know what is going on \"behind the scenes\", you can check the files that a package installs across the system on http://packages.ubuntu.com/. You can also download .deb package files from there, if you need to, but you wouldn't typically want to. You can also use apt to download and see the details of packages.\n\n\n*\n\n*To download a package file and its dependencies: sudo apt-get download\n<package>\n\n*To see the details of a package: sudo apt-cache showpkg <package>  \n\n*To see what packages you have downloaded (this directory is normally \nwrite-protected and not accessible by normal users): ls /var/cache/apt/archives\n\n*To clear the cache and save disk space: sudo apt-get clean\nTo conclude, in Linux, it is not necessary to know as the user where all the package's files are kept and what exactly is being done when you install one, unless you are doing advanced operations that explicitly require that knowledge. You have the powerful Software Center to see what programs you have installed and you can use that to install and remove them.\n\nA: Ubuntu is designed so that packages installed via apt-get are put in just the right places, so things just work without your having to worry about where things get downloaded, or what directory to install to, or things like that. sudo apt-get install <packagename> downloads a copy of the package to /var/cache/apt/archives, so you can look there for previously installed packages. Alternatively, you can run apt-get download <packagename> to download a .deb package file to the current directory, without installing it (it can be installed later via sudo dpkg -i filename.deb). However, for most users it's easiest just to use the standard sudo apt-get install ... command and not have to worry about backups or accidentally not installing something you downloaded earlier.\n\nA: Navigate to /var/cache/apt/archives. When you type sudo apt-get install program-name it downloads the program and it's dependencies to that location. Just copy the files from there to a backup location. If you want to re-install them or install them on another computer just paste them back in, disconnect from the internet, and type the regular install command, sudo apt-get install program-name. Alternatively you could also setup a local repository on your computer.\n", "Q: VirtualBox Toolbar is hidden! How to show it? I accidentally hide the main Toolbar from my VirtualBox Manager UI? In my ubuntu 12.04 .\n\nCan anyone let me know the detail steps to display the Toolbar again?\nI search the whole blogs but can't figure it out!\n\nA: I understand your frustration. It's very user unfriendly that you can remove the toolbar by right clicking it, and are seemingly supposed to right-click it again to view it, which isn't possible because it's invisible. :) \nYou can right-click the status bar and show the toolbar from there. If you've chosen to hide both the statusbar and the toolbar, then it's kinda difficult in Ubuntu, using Unity and Global Menus. If you're using som other desktop than Unity or you're using Unity and have deactivated Global Menus, then you can right-click the menubar to get the same options as you get on the toolbar and statusbar. \nIf you want to fix it manually, then you can open ~/.VirtualBox/VirtualBox.xml in GEdit or something. Then locate VirtualBox/Global/Extradata and add <ExtraDataItem name=\"GUI/Toolbar\" value=\"true\" />. That should work, although you might possibly have to restart VirtualBox.\n\nA: In Windows (and hopefully in Ubuntu, too) you can open the menu using your host key + Home key. From there you can access the \"view\" option to activate the menu/status bar again.\n\nA: To re-enable the Toolbar right-click on the bottom line, then select and tick the Show Toolbar entry on the pop-up menu:\n\n\nDo not disable both, the toolbar, and the statusbar.\n\nWhen running Unity desktop the only way to restore them is to manually edit the VirtualBox.xml file located in ~/.config/VirtualBox or ~/.VirtualBox.\nSearch for the following lines\n <ExtraDataItem name=\"GUI/Statusbar\" value=\"false\"/>\n <ExtraDataItem name=\"GUI/Toolbar\" value=\"false\"/>\n\nto replace \"false\" with \"true\".\nPlease make a backup of this file before you edit it, as all informations on your VMs are stored there as well. No instance of Virtual Box or VirtualBoxManager must run on editing this file because it will be overwritten otherwise.\n\nA: If you still have status bar: right click\n\nA: In VirtualBox 5.1 (running on Windows, it's probably the same on Ubuntu) I found that you can get this back by clicking Settings (in the main VirtualBox Manager window) for the relevant machine, and select User Interface in the left pane list. There you have check boxes for toggling the visibility of these bars. (Note that you can also toggle which specific items should be shown in menus and the status bar.)\n\n\nA: You can also check a config for certain workstation located in [machine_name].vbox file in your machine directory. This file seems to override global VB config.\nThere are following two flags\n<ExtraDataItem name=\"GUI/MenuBar/Enabled\" value=\"false\"/>\n<ExtraDataItem name=\"GUI/StatusBar/Enabled\" value=\"false\"/>\n\n\nA: Try Ctrl/Host + C it actually works, It's temporary but it works, it will show you the menu bar .\n\nA: Tested on UBUNTU GNOME (17.04) host and Win7 guest:\nHOST+Home-button works perfectly, since it pops up a menu from which you can reset/configure the view of Menu and Status bars.\n", "Q: Is it possible to swap between Ubuntu And Win8.1 if i install Ubuntu on a external HDD I am currently running Windows 8.1 and I was wondering if I am able to install Ubuntu to my external HDD (It already has stuff on it but it still has a lot of space) and swap between the 2 operating systems. If possible when I update Ubuntu and Windows 8.1 will the updates go to the HDD that the OS was installed 2. Also if I can boot ubuntu from a external HDD how do I swap between Windows 8.1 and Ubuntu?\n\nA: If by \"swap\" you mean booting into the different operating system (OS), then yes, it is entirely possible. Just install Ubuntu on the external hard drive, then ask the bios to boot into the external hard drive by default. Upon installation, Ubuntu will install the Grub (bootloader) that will allow you to choose which operating system to start. If you unplug the external hard drive, it will boot straight into Windows.\nTo recap:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Ubuntu on your external hard drive. It will automatically detect the other drive with Windows on it and set the bootloader accordingly.\n\n*Go in your bios and set the boot priority to External hard drive -> Internal HDD\n\nHowever, if by swap, you mean actively flipping from one OS to the the other, well, you can't do that. It's not just two different programs running at the same time that you can flip between. The operating system (OS) is responsible for the interactions between the hardware pieces of the computer. The OS needs to have full control of the hardware at all times.\nIf you REALLY want to flip between the two systems, you can use a virtual machine. Basically, you can set, say, Ubuntu, to be able to start Windows inside itself. You would obtain the layers:\nHardware-> Ubuntu -> \"faked hardware\" -> Windows\n", "Q: motd displayed twice So here's the deal.

It tells me that it detected a winEFI, would I like to activate ? Of course yes. And boot repair finishes.\nHere is the boot info summary.\nFrom here I'm almost convinced it should work.\nI reboot pressing F2 to enter UEFI.

But the system didn't let me, on this boot and the 3 to 5 I did after that, I couldn't boot anymore. My grub was lost. My computer either hangs on the BIOS splash screen or won't recognized my \"Ubuntu\" media anymore in the UEFI Boot option. It will now say UEFI - VERBATIM 8GB ...\nSo what am I supposed to do here?

(I once got the problem with a LiveUSB, couldn't pass the GRUB or no workaround worked) \nOr is something wrong with my install/boot-repair?\n\nA: Some EFIs have amnesia -- they forget their boot settings when rebooting or after being powered off. There can also be problems with another OS (typically Windows) resetting its own boot loader as the default. There are several possible solutions to such problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*A firmware update might fix this problem, so it's worth trying. In fact, I'd try this option first.\n\n*If you're dual-booting with Windows, then in Windows, open an Administrator Command Prompt window and type bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \\EFI\\ubuntu\\grubx64.efi. Change the path to the boot loader if you're using something else -- note that if Secure Boot is active, you'll be using shim, which is normally shimx64.efi on Ubuntu.\n\n*Speaking of Secure Boot, try disabling it -- it can sometimes cause problems even if everything is configured the way it should be.\n\n*Copy EFI/ubuntu/grubx64.efi to EFI/BOOT/bootx64.efi on the ESP. (The ESP is normally mounted at /boot/efi in Ubuntu.)\n\n*Back up EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi (if present) on the ESP and copy grubx64.efi to that name. bootmgfw.efi is the Windows boot loader, and some buggy EFIs boot it automatically.\n\n\nThose last two items can be done semi-automatically by Boot Repair, although you may need to check an Advanced option to get them to work.\n", "Q: Weird volume levels I have a old HP Pavilion dv6645eo with the HP Quicklaunch buttons.

It is easy to change the display orientation under the Display settings menu or by typing, e.g. xrandr -o inverted in the terminal.\nHowever, such does not rotate the input of the touchscreen (or—less importantly—the touchpad). \nI have looked around for solutions to this issue, and found two promising sources.\n(1) http://cc.oulu.fi/~rantalai/synaptics/.  Installing the package here and running the advised commands rotated the display and touchpad input (but not that of the touchscreen).\n(2) http://www.elfsternberg.com/2013/05/25/thinkpad-yoga-ubuntu-12/.  This website recommended updating an input package, which I haven't tried.\n\nA: I found a straightforward answer to my question by reading the helpful information at Ubuntu Wiki: X - Input Coordinate Transformation.\nThese commands can be used to align rotations of the input devices and the display:\n\n\n*\n\n*The first command rotates the display, where  can be left, right, normal, or inverted:\nxrandr -o <orientation>\n\n*remap the input device:\nxinput set-prop '<device name>' 'Coordinate Transformation Matrix' <matrix-elements-rowwise>\nThe second command remaps the input device (that is, the touchpad or the the touchscreen) where <matrix-elements-rowwise> is 0 -1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1, 0 1 0 -1 0 1 0 0 1, 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1, or -1 0 1 0 -1 1 0 0 1; corresponding to the orientations above.\nThe names of the touchpad and touchscreen can be found with xinput list and either can be disabled entirely with xinput disable <device-name>.  Subsequently, xinput enable <device-name> will re-enable the input device.\nIn my case, and probably for others with a Yoga 13 (also on Yoga 2 Pro), the touchscreen is called ELAN Touchscreen and the touchpad \nSynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad.\nThus, I put a short script in my home directory called rotate-inverted.sh with the following content:\n\n    #!/bin/bash\n    # This script rotates the screen and touchscreen input 180 degrees, disables the touchpad, and enables the virtual keyboard\n    xrandr -o inverted\n    xinput set-prop 'ELAN Touchscreen' 'Coordinate Transformation Matrix' -1 0 1 0 -1 1 0 0 1\n    xinput disable 'SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad'\n    onboard &\n\nThen I made the script executable with\nchmod u+x rotate-inverted.sh\n\nand assigned the command ~/rotate-inverted.sh to the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+I in\nSystem Settings -> Keyboard.\nAfter I logged out and logged back in, I was able to rotate the keyboard by pressing that shortcut.\nI did the same type of thing for the other rotation positions, using the commands xinput enable 'SynPS/2 TouchPad' and killall onboard instead of xinput disable 'SynPS/2 TouchPad' and onboard & for rotate-normal.sh.\nSome others on this thread have discussed assigning such scripts to the extra buttons on the\nYoga — such as the lock button — as well as automatically executing them upon changing the Yoga's position; but I was not sure how to do this.\n\nA: I added couple more lines, second run of the script will turn screen back to normal and enable the touchpad, tested with Ideapad 2 Pro.

It may be worth trying.\n\nA: A solutions without xrandr (which doesn't work on wayland)\nA solution on Ubuntu 19.04 with wayland is to set the rotate-monitor key to some keybinding using gsettings or dconf-editor.\nFor instance, the following command will cause Ctrl+F8 to rotate the screen counterclockwise:\n$ gsettings set org.gnome.mutter.keybindings rotate-monitor \"['XF86RotateWindows', '<Control>F8']\"\n\nThis does not allow the user to specify the target orientation, but only to rotate the screen until the desired orientation is reached.\n(original posted here: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/465395/20661)\n\nA: autorotate is Linux/X11 utility for 2in1 laptops and other devices with touchscreen. No ROOT privileges necessary!\nCommand left right portrait and lanscape are wrappers around xrandr and xinput to synchronize rotation of screen and digitizer.

A student just asked what could be the downside of having a dot (. ) in the name of the user. For example: john.doe\nHow will this affect the system or any apps for that matter?\n\nA: Marc Haber explains a possible downside in Debian bug #604242 (Allow dots in username by default):\n\nHaving dots in the user name creates some issues with scipts using\n  chown, which still accepts dots as separator between user name and\n  group name. If chown still accepts dots, there will be scripts using\n  this notation, which will break if a user name contains a dot.\nI would recommend keeping the current default (which can be\n  overwritten by local configuration) until chown has stopped accepting\n  dots as separator.\n\nAnd chown still accepts the dot as separator, although it isn't documented anymore. I agree POSIX compatibility should prevail, and I indeed employ user names containing dots on several systems without any adverse effects.\n\nA: POSIX states this about usernames:\n\n[...] To be portable across systems conforming to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, the value is composed of characters from the portable filename character set. The hyphen should not be used as the first character of a portable user name.\n\n... where the portable filename character set is:\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\na b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . _ -\n\nAlso, the manpage for the /etc/adduser.conf file  states:\n   VALID NAMES\n          adduser and addgroup enforce conformity to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,\n          which  allows  only  the following characters to appear in group\n          and user names: letters, digits, underscores, periods, at  signs\n          (@) and dashes. The name may not start with a dash. The \"$\" sign\n          is allowed at the end of usernames (to conform to samba).\n\n          An additional  check  can  be  adjusted  via  the  configuration\n          parameter NAME_REGEX to enforce a local policy.\n\nHowever,\nWhilst both specifications seem to include the dot, Ubuntu (on my 13.04 at least) seems to disallow it:\n⊳ sudo adduser as.df\nadduser: Please enter a username matching the regular expression configured\nvia the NAME_REGEX[_SYSTEM] configuration variable.  Use the `--force-badname'\noption to relax this check or reconfigure NAME_REGEX.\n\nThe default NAME_REGEX in Ubuntu is (from the /etc/adduser.conf manpage):\n^[a-z][-a-z0-9]*$\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Starting with a lowercase letter then any number of dashes, lowercase letters or digits. No _, @ or ..\n\n\nSo,\nin conclusion a dot . may be used for a Ubuntu username, the NAME_REGEX just has to be changed in /etc/adduser.conf. Seeing as it conforms to POSIX, there shouldn't be any problems with having a . in the username with any POSIX-compliant program.\nTo enable a dot in usernames\n\n\n*\n\n*Run this command in a terminal:\nsudo nano /etc/adduser.conf\n\n\n*Locate this line (near the end of the file)\n#NAME_REGEX=\"^[a-z][-a-z0-9]*$\"\n\nand replace it with\nNAME_REGEX='^[a-z][-.a-z0-9]*$'\n\nNote that the - must remain the first character in the bracket expression [...], otherwise it is treated as specifying a range a-z.\n\n*Press Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter.\n\nReferences: \n\n\n*\n\n*Why are underscores not allowed in usernames in some distros (Debian for example)\n\n*man adduser.conf\n\nA: Applications that reads usernames might use a regex that assumes your username follows the rules and therefore can't handle your username.\n\nA: It seems that there is a reason behind this limitation.\nIf you try to run systemd service for scripts, it can be starting as root and not as a user. It's caused by systemd not recognize user with dot (domain.com user name for example) as valid user and runs service as root instead. Still this can b fixed already on systemd side, but still has a risk.\nAlso having dots in the user name creates some issues with scripts using chown, which still accepts dots as separator between user name and group name. If chown still accepts dots, there will be scripts using this notation, which will break if a user name contains a dot.\n", "Q: Slow wireless with rt2800pci My wireless connection is extremely slow.

It also involved manual comparing of several .config subdirectories.\nOf course, what I should have done was ask my search engine \"where does xubuntu store display settings\" and find this thread at ubuntuforums... \n\n*Log in to your blank display and use CTRL+ALT+F# to enter command line.\n\n*sudo find . -type f -name \"*displays*\"\n\n*mv ~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/displays.xml ~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/displays.xml.bak\n\n*sudo reboot\nI hope this quest may help somebody.\n\nA: You should be able to open (and set properties for) a display via the virtual terminal console provided you know the display number for the running X session. That's usually :0 for the primary physical display but that's not always the case. For example, to query display :0\nxrandr -d :0 -q\n\nTo re-enable a display that's been turned off, it's usually sufficient to use the --auto e.g. to turn the LVDS1 output device on display :0 back on\nxrandr -d :0 --output LVDS1 --auto \n\n\nA: I would extend the answer of Martin Marčan by replacing the sleep with a command that switches to the black console:\nchvt 7 && xrandr -d :0 --output LVDS --auto\n\nwhere 7 is the number of the console used for X11 (usually 7 or 8) and LVDS is the name of the output you want to reconfigure. You can retrieve the list of outputs first with \nxrandr -d :0\n\n\nA: After running this command switch immediately to  the tty where the screen is black, and after 5 seconds the screen should show up.\nsleep 5 && xrandr -d :0 --output LVDS --auto\n\nThe xrandr command will turn on your main screen. It only seems to work if you're currently on the tty where your display manager is run, hence the sleep to give you some time to be able to switch.\n\nA: I solved this problem in Lubuntu 18.04 like this:\nIf you boot into a screen, which is turned of, open a terminal blindly with CTR-ALT-T. Since you cannot see the terminal and what you write, type very carefully \nxrandr --output \"nameYourScreen\" --auto\n\nHit Enter. Voila.\n(BTW: In my case, entering such code in tty1 or any virtual terminal did not work. I tried various things, people mention above, but when switching back to the running session or after reboot, nothing changed. Maybe the problem is that xrandr can execute this command properly for some hardware only within a running x-session ?)\n\nA: Try this:\nxrandr --output \"nameYourVGA\" --mode \"yourResolution\"\n\nFor example:\nxrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1366x768\n\nSee if that works.\n\nA: This works for enable two external monitors on my computer (Ubuntu with i3wm):\nxrandr --auto\n\nThat turns on all the monitors.\nThen I disable the duplicate desktop and setup the resolution (eDP-1 - my laptop monitor, DP-1-1 and DP-1-2 - my external monitors connected via thunderbolt):\nxrandr --output DP-1-2 --mode 1920x1080 --left-of eDP-1\nxrandr --output DP-1-1 --mode 1920x1080 --left-of DP-1-2\n\n", "Q: Decrease in Network Speeds On 12.04 I have a newish 12.04 box that I converted from FreeNAS due to the difficulty with the FreeNAS operating system and slow transfer speeds over gigabit ethernet.  I got 12.04 setup without many difficulties and have been using the software RAID 5 for an array of 4 1 tb disks.  Average read rate on the array is 298 MBps.  Setup NFS to connect between the Linux server and my Mac and was initially getting transfer speeds between 80 MBps and 110 MBps.  Something has changed and now I am getting peak transfer speeds of 25 MBps with an average of around 17.5 MBps.\nI've checked with a Windows 8.1 machine and with a Mac, with both Samba and NFS, and the transfer speeds are almost exactly the same across the board.  Ran several tests with iperf, all of which have shown consistent speeds of 950 mbps so it would seem to be a software issue as opposed to a limit imposed by the hardware.  I have downloaded Bonnie++ but I honestly have no idea where to begin with getting that to output something that is intelligible to me.  All of my hardware is the same as when I was getting better performance so I am assuming it is something on the software side of Linux.\nIn Linux, /etc/exports is setup for the NFS server as:\n/fileserver *(rw,async,no_subtree_check)\n\nOn the Mac it is set to automount to /Network/Filserver with the following settings: \n-fstype=nfs,soft,intr,noatime,timeo=900,retrans=3,proto=tcp 10.0.1.21:/fileserver\n\nI had rsize and wsize set to 8192 but took it out as I figured it might do a better job negotiating those settings automatically.\nHere's the information returned on the network card:\n    sudo lshw -class network\n        *-network               \n        description: Ethernet interface\n        product: RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller\n        vendor: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd.\n        physical id: 0\n        bus info: pci@0000:02:00.0\n        logical name: eth0\n        version: 06\n        serial: d4:3d:7e:d8:0f:47\n        size: 1Gbit/s\n        capacity: 1Gbit/s\n        width: 64 bits\n        clock: 33MHz\n        capabilities: pm msi pciexpress msix vpd bus_master cap_list ethernet physical tp mii 10bt 10bt-fd 100bt 100bt-fd 1000bt 1000bt-fd autonegotiation\n        configuration: autonegotiation=on broadcast=yes driver=r8169 driverversion=2.3LK-NAPI duplex=full firmware=rtl8168e-3_0.0.4 03/27/12 ip=10.0.1.21 latency=0 link=yes multicast=yes port=MII speed=1Gbit/s\n        resources: irq:40 ioport:d000(size=256) memory:f0004000-f0004fff memory:f0000000-f0003fff\n\nRouter is a WNDR3700, all Cat 5e cabling with a gigabit swtich.

Thanks!\n\nA: You could look through your logs (the slash key (\"/\") will do a case-sensitive search):\n\ncd /var/logs\nless syslog\nless messages\nless dmesg\n\n...or watch new entries to them:\n\ngrep -i error /var/logs/syslog\n\nI think you might be asking for a network troubleshooting tool like Wireshark or info troubleshooting NetworkManager.\n\nHowever, the slow transfer speeds over the network may only be a symptom of issues reading/writing to disk.  Try looking at Disk Utility or running some commands:\n\nsudo badblocks -sv /dev/desired/path\nsudo fsck /dev/desired/path\n\nCan you remember any changes at all from when it transfered at higher rates, to when it transfered at lower rates?  \n", "Q: I suspect rtorrent is crashing my server.

I find KDE for Kubuntu 13.10 is annoying.\n\nA: Yes, you can use multiple desktops in Kubuntu. You should go to System Settings >> Personal >> Desktops >> Multiple Desktops. Here's an official quick guide on basic settings: http://www.kubuntu.org/docs/kquickguide/C/ch03s07.html#desktop-multipledesktops\nNow, if you find KDE annoying, maybe you should try another desktop environment, such as Unity. I believe you don't need to reinstall your system to get a new desktop environment running... installing the appropriate packages should do.

I am afraid if I do that it's going to overwrite my internal harddrive and brick my macbook air... or at least overwrite my OSX filesystem - ...

Is that correct?\nThanks!\nI hope my question is clear.\n\nA: If you don't need to save files on your thumb drive, you don't need to do anything. Do not run the installer from the thumb drive system.\nIf you do need to save files on your thumb drive, see this question. You'll want to create a persistent area on your thumb drive. The installation might be similar to the way you created the Ubuntu thumb drive in the first place, though I am unsure if the methods there will work on OS X. If you need further help with that youcan expand your question here or post a new one. This will not involve running the installer inside the thumb drive system, either, and when using a system with a persistent area, you should still not run that.\nIn any case, you are right to think that clicking Install Ubuntu inside the thumbdrive system can overwrite data on your hard disk. You can install Ubuntu to your hard disk without overwriting data, by clicking that and then being very careful to tell Ubuntu to install alongside your existing system. But if you don't want Ubuntu on another disk, don't use \"Install Ubuntu\" on the thumbdrive system.\nIf you want to install Ubuntu on a second thumbdrive, then one of your options is to use \"Install Ubuntu,\" though I suspect the system produced in that way, when installed on a drive attached to a Mac via USB, will not boot.\n", "Q: How should I upload my .vcf contacts to Thunderbird?

In order to trick people into upgrading to the newest version of Ubuntu rather than using an unsupported release, they like to move the repositories. They do the same thing with ubuntu iso downloads. You can update your sources.list to use the new location, then everything will work.\nIn terminal type: sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list\nChange all the ubuntu.com entries so that they start with http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ .

Some options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Java\n\n*Pyhon\n\n*C/C++ (in this case you need to recompile the programme on the Windows machine)\n\n*C#\nFor the first three I recommend Eclipse as IDE; for C# Monodevelop is the way to go.\nBut there may be many other options.\n\nA: If you actually want to use C# and .NET in the process you'll need to install Windows in a virtual machine. If you're targeting a specific problem you should always have a machine (virtual or not) which runs that platform for testing. Once you've created a Windows machine you'll be able to work with Visual Studio on that.\nYou can always try to create a application in a cross platform programming language like Java. Applications written in Java are able to run on any platform the JRE supports without a lot of effort.\n", "Q: Can't boot into Windows 7 EFI GPT after recovery operation My question, or rather issue, is in the extent of this previous case in which I wanted to grow my Linux (ext4) partition. The partition /dev/sda6 was in the way of doing this and since it contained bios_grub I didn't touch it until someone with expert knowledge could help me.\n\nAs suggested by the helper I deleted the highlighted partition /dev/sda6\n\nAll seemed well\nThe partition was successfully removed so I went on to step 3, merging /dev/sda7 (the ext4 containing everything Ubuntu) with the unallocated partition to grow my Linux partition.\n\nEverything still seemed to be going the right way\nSo everything went well. The helper suggested to turn swappoff on /sda8 during the process, so I did.\nGparted kept on merging the two partitions, which I think was a good thing, as well as refreshing itself to find all the partitions after turning swapoff.\nWhen GParted finally refreshed, the program just stopped and shut itself down while it was still in the middle of growing /dev/sda7.\nI restarted GParted to find this:\n\nMini heart attack\nNow I'm running sudo testdisk from Ubuntu live DVD session, performing a deeper search on the hard drive. I did this yesterday allready, but I realized fixing this was a little, if not way over my head. So please, if you have the time (but especially the knowledge to help me with this (preferably in real time through chat or anything)), help me liberate myself from this torment...\nEDIT: 'new' information:\n \n\nExtra information if needed \nEDIT:  \n\n\n\nTestDisk results \nOutput of fdisk in terminal: \nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda\n\nWARNING: GPT (GUID Partition Table) detected on '/dev/sda'!

The unlabeled partitions are respectively 2 Linux partitions containing data (a lot of it is damaged, but thats not the upmost priority at the moment) and one SWAP partition.  \nAt the moment I am copying the whole hard disk to an external hard disk to prepare for any probable error when fiddling with TestDisk to try and recover the system.  \nEDIT 13 Februari 2014:\nAt the moment my setup looks like this. I have some confusion over my hard disk, was it MBR or GPT to begin with? Anyway, some last steps to be taken care of, I hope someone can help me! Ubuntu is booting from GRUB and/or rEFInd but Windows 7 just doesn't boot.\n\nI tried with every boot repair option I could find (about windows 7) but untill now everything has failed.\n- Boot with Windows 7 boot repair cd and enter Command Prompt environment\n- I tried the commands: bootrec /fixmbr, bootrec /fixboot, bootrec /rebuildbcd, and rebooted, but it fixed nothing\n- So I tried the \"nuclear method\" by using the commands: bootsect /nt60 c: /force /mbr, bcdboot c:\\windows /s c:\n- boot-repair-disk (linux lubuntu) didn't help me either, I tried common repair and advanced repair.\nAbove steps didn't work for me.\nsda4 is the partition containing the Windows OS\n\nA: Try option 1 in gdisk and see what it says (type p to view your partitions). gdisk holds data in memory until you write, so using this option to view the partitions is fairly risk-free; only if you type w to save your changes will you put anything at risk. If you're lucky, gdisk will be able to recover valid partition data. See this page (part of the gdisk documentation) for more on repairing GPT disks.\nIf gdisk doesn't work or if some of the partitions it recovers are invalid, you may need to use TestDisk.\n\nEdit: It's PROBABLY OK to accept the partitions that gdisk has recovered. It appears that those partitions are from after your partition-resizing operation. With the exception of /dev/sda7, which you resized, the gdisk output matches that shown in your second screen shot. (One important caveat: gdisk shows start and stop points precisely, but GParted doesn't.) Given your description, it sounds as if the resize operation succeeded, so chances are /dev/sda7 will work when recovered. If not, you can delete it without touching the other partitions and then use TestDisk to try to recover the filesystem that /dev/sda7 should contain.\nNote that there can be NO GUARANTEES about any of this. In a worst-case scenario, though, you can wipe the recovered partition table and start again; you would then be no worse off than you are now.\n", "Q: Installing Clang+LLVM 3.4 from llvm.org into Saucy 13.10 I'm trying to setup Saucy to install clang and llvm 3.4 from the official LLVM apt repo, but it doesn't work.

Skype has been working fine for a fair while, but has (in the last week or so) stopped making notification sounds. Normal audio for calls is fine, but the ringtone and other alerts are now not making any noise at all.\nThe cause appears to be that the wav files are all missing.\n\nI've not deleted them - at least, not knowingly - and not made any changes within Skype.

Security packages always have higher version string. Always. You don't need to set package pinning to prefer those packages. APT will always install the higher version available unless any user preference restrict this behaviour, which is what you are doing.\nI don't know what you want to achieve with those package pinning, but they will give you headaches. Package pinning was designed for different packages sources (i. e. Ubuntu and some sort of PPA) and is normally preferred to manipulate the priority of the non-official source. The proposed repository always has lower priority, the security repository always has automatic upgrades daily.\nI recommend you lower the PPA priority (if it's that what you want to control) instead of modifying the Ubuntu repositories.\nIf you don't want to change anything, you can force apt to bind to your wishes using:\nsudo apt-get install libxi6=2:1.7.1.901-1ubuntu1~precise1\n\nor\nsudo apt-get install libxi6/precise-updates\n\nBut remember that the updates repositories always will have all the changes made by the security repositories.\n", "Q: Installation problem xdg-desktop-menu: No writable system menu directory found When installing the IBM tsm backup client I have the following message on lucid (works on precise)\n> sudo apt-get upgrade\nSetting up tsm-client (6.4.0.7-3) ...\nxdg-desktop-menu: No writable system menu directory found.\ndpkg: error processing tsm-client (--configure):\n subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 3\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n tsm-client\nE: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)\n\nWhat is the problem here?\n\nA: I found the answer on linux bug reports. It is a bug in xdg. I have found that you can get around it by simply creating the folder it is looking for. i.e.\nsudo mkdir /usr/share/desktop-directories/\n\n", "Q: How do I kill locked mythtv frontend I have a new install of Ubuntu 13.10 with mythtv .27 installed. After configuring mythtv FE I tried to exit.  It would not let me exit.  \nI tried several times without success.  Because mythtv FE loads full screen I didn't have access to any other means of exiting Ubuntu.  \nI was forced to reboot the computer.  After the reboot Ubuntu automatically loaded mytyuhtv FE, again in full screen mode. \nI tried to exit mythtv FE as before but the command is ignored leaving me with a locked computer.  Basically my only options is to prevent mythtv FE from automatically loading after the reboot. \nUntil I can accomplish that the computer is basically useless.  Here's where I need help because I don't know how to accomplish that.  \nAny assistance will be appreciated\n\nA: I have the same problem with Mythtv. You were able to configure it! When I enter setup-(larger than) fullscreen-I'm unable to get any farther than language and location and cannot see any buttons to click. Try to close it starts an infinite loop and it starts back up again and becomes harder to close.\nWhat I do is use HTOP to find mythtv and issue a kill 9 command.\n$ sudo apt-get install htop  \nYou can use htop from a virtual terminal\nctrl+alt+F3 (any F key from 2-5) Return to your GUI screen with ctrl+alt+F7\nI also used \n$ sudo apt-get remove --purge mythtv\nto dump mythtv from my system. Be sure to manually delete the .mythtv file in your home directory.\nI've look in vain for instructions on configuring mythtv. There are plenty of install and use instructions but none address the problem of the loop and overblown screen size.\nYes version 0.27 is out now. I'm resigned that Mythtv won't be near a reality until it gets beyond version 1.0! Between Me-Tv (can't change channels but is a GOOD PVR) and TV Time (GREAT picture, no sound) I don't think Ubuntu or Linux can provide a TV media experience for the average end-user at this time. I'm still trying though. Been watching Ubuntu since 7.04. Just went full time (no dual boot) 2 months ago and miss my PVR (we call it DVR in US).\n", "Q: using gnome-disks/terminal to format usb drive in ubuntu 12.10, FAT32 I know its a duplicate question, but I couldn't find a answer that would have satisfied me..\nI recently upgraded to Ubuntu 12.10, You know I was holding with the LTS but couldn't resist all those new enhancements either. So now the Disk Utility is gone.\nSo some existing posts on \"how to format a usb\" refer to using Disks, selecting More Actions and then Format... I don't know if I am doing right? see here.\nand then I go for Edit Partition Type and now I see a lot of option for FAT32. \nWhich one to select?\nAnd If I use terminal- Is this correct? I need citation.\n$sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb1\n\nI also tried using gparted, but It wont allow me formating. See here.\nI'd prefer to use terminal :) \n\nA: GParted is by far the best option. The picture you showed is normal, as you have to unmount the partition before you can format it.\nThe terminal command you gave, at a guess, might just create a new partition table of type 'vfat'.\n", "Q: I accidentally deleted my home folder and Trash bin (Ubuntu 12.04) I accidentally deleted the Files folders from /usr/share/application, and now I can't open the Trash bin from the unity Panel. and I can't open any of my folders from the Dash. \nAlso, my home folder is missing from the Panel (or Launcher).

It does highlighting, making it easy to use.\nBluefish  is very good as well, and also does the collapse/expand behaviour you want.\n\nA: I'm currently using jEdit for LaTeX and python.  I find the syntax highlighting better than notepad++, and it does code folding, though I haven't tried it on C.\nI was seriously considering trying notepad++ under wine though.\n\nA: You may use QtCreator only (probably without tool-chains and compilers). There are good code highlight and ability to customize syntax for yourself. Also, as you asked, QtCreator is able to create table of context + code completion.\n", "Q: How can I mount network CIFS folder? My sw ntfs shared directory is an installation directory on a windows 2008 server.\nI'm using Ubuntu 12.04\nI did the mkdir /media/sw and smbclient -L successfully... then while in root I tried \nmount -t cifs -o user=username,ro //132.72.116.14/sw /media/sw \n\nand got: \nmount error(13): Permission denied\nRefer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g. man mount.cifs)\n\n\nA: Apparently, you wanted to mount the shared folder which was in the windows server. As a result, you got an error of user privileges, that was because you forgot to set the password of the windows server. Mounting the windows machine from Ubuntu requires you to set both user && pass of the windows server. You just need to use your windows server login details.\n", "Q: GRUB menu doesn't render properly I just dual-booted my windows 8.1 with Ubuntu 12.04.03 on UEFI. No problems. The only thing is that the GRUB menu doesn't render properly. The text is all jagged up. Here's what I see:\n\nWhat do I do??\n\nA: I don't know why but the following solved the problem:\nMy default bootloader was windows and it used to give some sort of an error (bootmanager.efi not found) and then I used to do a F12 on the start screen to go to the Ubuntu GRUB menu where I used to get the jagged screen.\nSo what I did was, I went to the BIOS menu and made the GRUB the default bootloader and the next time I started up my machine, I got the normal purple GRUB menu without any problem.\nStill no clue why this happened, but it seemed to work for me.\n", "Q: I'm in the current development version after doing \"do-release-upgrade -d\", why? I don't know how, but I was upgrading from ubuntu 11.10 using:\nsudo do-release-upgrade -d\n\nThen after the upgrade and a reboot, I did:\nsudo lsb_release -a\n\nand got:\nNo LSB modules are available.\nDistributor ID: \nUbuntu Description:Ubuntu Trusty Tahr (development branch)\nRelease:        14.04\nCodename:       trusty\n\nHow was this possible? Is it possible to downgrade without a rebuild? I guess I'm an alpha tester for 14.04 now?\n\nA: You have chosen to upgrade to the development version by choosing option -d in sudo do-release-upgrade -d\nSo, for one reason or another, you've upgraded Ubuntu to a new version. Now, you're not liking the new version (or it's a development version and too unstable for your taste). \nthere are mainly two methods to downgrade and since its too long to state here so please check the community help page for that by clicking here.\n\nA: The release team is enabling upgrade paths that will allow jumping between releases. I don't really know why were you using -d parameter that will leave you in the latest development version, but that's expected... I guess. I've never seen someone jumping through  7 releases, ever, but with the recent changes in the upgrade paths I should be expecting some weird cases.\nThere's no method to downgrade Ubuntu version, just reinstall using your prefered LTS or normal releases after doing the mandatory backups.\n", "Q: Install GIMP's Felimage plugin I am following a tutorial and the step I'm at requires to apply a filter \"Felimage\".

I'm glad to find out that I should boldy edit the Ubuntu and community wikis, including adding new info to old pages, and that there is even a way to request whole page deletions where necessary.\nHowever, what if a page contains some useful information, and some just plain old instructions? You know those pages that include stuff about Dapper and Hardy and workarounds that (thankfully) we no longer need, thanks to those same brave souls who went before us.\nMy instinct is that instructions for non-supported releases should not be on the latest revision of a wiki page. Is there a policy for this? If so, should the old instructions be deleted, archived, or something else? If not, is there a preferred way to separate them out?\n\nA: Jorge did a talk (I guess it was more of an almost-four-minute-long battle cry) about deleting harmful, old content from the Wiki. It makes a lot of sense in some situations.\nBut I'd personally use it in moderation. If something is just old, it might still apply. If it's just potentially harmful, perhaps improving it with a few warnings might be a better step. I think to qualify for deletion you need to be in the area where its modern-day appeal is really very limited. \nYou can follow these instructions if you feel something needs to be removed:\n\n\n*\n\n*What team do I need to talk to about deleting a page on help.ubuntu.com?\n", "Q: installing .deb file without internet connection without software centre i want to install OS uninstaller i have its .deb file and the two other dependency files(.deb) required for it but when i try to install the dependency file in the liveUSB the software center opens and the install button is grayed out, is there any other way?\n\nA: Try  this : \nInstall GDebi by running the following command on the terminal. \nsudo apt-get install gdebi\n\nAfter it is installed go to your .deb file, right-click and 'open with GDebi'.\nor\ncd /path/to/the/directoy/which/contains/.deb/file\nsudo gdebi filename.deb\n\nIt will install the package along with it's dependencies.\n\nA: you can do it via command line:\ncd /path-to-directory-that-contains-the-deb-files\nsudo dpkg -i XXX.deb\n\n", "Q: When exactly does SSH-agent use my private_key to connect to a remote server? I need some basics about SSH, to help me understand the process of SSH connecting.\nI have Ubuntu server on my virtualbox and Ubuntu desktop on my host. I've established connection with my VM by adding id_rsa.pub to authorized_keys on the remote (added by ssh-copy-id). id_rsa.pub is generated by ssh-keygen as well as id_rsa.\nI successfully connect to my remote without typing the password, but I don't understand when exactly and why need the file id_rsa which is stored along to id_rsa.pub?\nI tried to delete this private key, but in spite of this the connection still works! In my mind, this file doesn't need to establish connection with my VM. \n\nA: To \"explore\" how ssh is working, you can use the verbose flags. For example, \nssh -v ...\n\nwill give information on the handshake. You can use multiple v, with a maximum of three, to have even more debugging info:\nssh -vvv ...\n\nNevertheless, the link of the wikipedia page posted by @darent is worth reading to understand the asymmetric key encryption. A lot of useful links on the details can be found in this question on SuperUser.\n\nA: Let me try to explain this with an example. Suppose I trust you and want you to SSH into my computer and do something. I can tell you my password or you can give me your public key. \nIf you give me your public key, when you try to log into my computer, your SSH client will use your private key to generate the encrypted authentication request at your end and send it to my computer. My computer will use your public key to decrypt the encrypted authentication request and thus authenticate that it is you and not someone else trying to break into my computer. \nNote: The private-public key pair is not used to encrypt the transmission between two computers. So once the connection is established the keys are not needed until the connection is terminated and a new connection is attempted. SSH has its own internal data encryption system in place that does not depend on the private-public key pair.\nSo, by accepting your public key, I have trusted you to enter my computer. If you ever break my trust I will delete your public key from my computer. Then you will not be able to SSH into my computer any more. \nIf you give your private key to someone else (or if someone steals it) then that person will be able to pretend to be you. If I find out that you have given your private key to someone else, I will delete your public key from my computer. Then neither you nor the other person will be able to SSH into my computer. \nThe public key you gave me is useless if I try to SSH into your computer, as it only good for decrypting information you generate with your private key. If you want me to SSH into your computer, you will have to put my public key in the right place in your computer.\nUbuntu stores your private keys in password management software called Password and Encryption Keys:\n\nNote, the middle tab My Personal Keys. This to protect your private key from being stolen (and from accidentally deleting your private key).\nHere is more information about the Seahorse password manager.\nHope this helps \n\nA: You are not supposed to manually \"use\"  your private key. The public/private cryptography is based in using two keys, one that goes public and another that stays in your computer, the private one.\nWhenever somebody has to send you an encrypted message, or you have to use authentication, like SSH does, it will use the public key to encrypt the data. Once you get the data, the only key that can decrypt them is the private one.\nThink of it as if you had two keys: Whatever is locked with one key, can only be unlocked with the opposite. So don't delete your private key because that would render the public one useless.\nIf you want to learn more you can check this link to Wikipedia, it has a good explanation about asymmetric key encryption.\n\nA: Do you mean you deleted the private key on the server?  If that's the case it's only used when sshing FROM that server.  It would have no impact on sshing TO that server.\n", "Q: Custom keyboard shortcut not working in Saucy I'm trying to set up a shortcut that will open the gnome-control-center to the display tab.\nThe command for this is gnome-control-center display which works in a terminal and in the dash.\nI set up the custom keyboard shortcut in the settings > keyboard > shortcuts panel but no matter what I set as the shortcut, nothing happens. In the command, I tried to echo text into a file but nothing happens either.\nHow should I set up my custom keyboard shortcut?\n\nA: There seems to be a bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-control-center/+bug/1224732\nIt has only recently affected me. I was fine on 13.10, but some recent updates have killed my shortcuts. \nThey work fine in a gnome session, but do nothing in ubuntu. I'm not knowledgeable enough with the workings of this area to debug it though :/\n\nA: After many many tests, I've discovered that the first thing to test is whether the command or script concerned really works (e.g. using command line) or not, and then the second thing to test is whether the custom key combination chosen (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+D) conflicts with another one in use.\nUnfortunately, the second problem seems much more difficult to resolve because the current gnome-control-center system apparently does/can not warn all such conflicts.\nFor instance, in the case mentioned here (gnome-control-center display) a custom keyboard shortcut such as Ctrl+Alt+D doesn't work - without any warning when assigning it - but a custom keyboard shortcut such as Ctrl+Super+Backspace does work.\nTherefore, one might need a lot of trial-and-error work to find a good keyboard shortcut.\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*It might also be necessary to log out and then log back in for the newly assigned keyboard shortcut to work.\n\n*In addition to many keyboard shortcuts used in various application, here are some Unity keyboard shortcuts to avoid: What are Unity's keyboard and mouse shortcuts?\n", "Q: piping using ssh without having to relogin for every pipe I have an ssh connection and I have to send some local files and output to the ssh server.\nI know I can do this using the following command\ntar zcf - stuff | ssh user@server 'tar zxf -'\n\nI would like to set it up in sequence using the && operator. I already have a connection and I don't want to relogin for every pipe, since I'll be using only one at a time. \nJust to clarify I'm not just moving tarballs over the network but also input from devices collected from time to time as the pipeline opens. Just to stop people from saying: \"why don't you use this program to move your file over the internet\" or \"you could also use a usb drive to transfer those files\"\n\nA: You can use persistent connections.  In your ~/.ssh/config file, add lines like this.\nHost server.name.or.wildcard.goes.here\nControlPath /tmp/ssh.%r@%h:%p\nControlMaster auto\nControlPersist yes\nServerAliveInterval 300\nServerAliveCountMax 15\n\nThis will tell ssh to keep the connection open with a file in /tmp that's based on the user/host/port combination.  After you connect once, ssh will reuse an existing connection.  It will eventually time out and disconnect automatically.  This way you only get your password prompt once for several commands running in quick succession, up to a specified amount of time.  If the connection is idle for too long, it will be closed and you will need to type a password again.\nKeeping the connection open also removes the initial delay of creating a secure connection.  This is great for scripts where you need to do some action like copy a file, then wait, then copy another file, etc.  cdist uses this technique to speed up machine provisioning.\nYou can also look into making ssh keys to avoid the password completely.\n", "Q: How to set up VOIP in ubuntu I am running a small business unit on agency recruitments.

I'm experiencing this problem where VLC continues to inhibit the power management daemon even after playback has ended (even though the option in the VLC preferences is labeled \"Inhibit the power management daemon during playback\").  I asked in the VLC Forum but got no reply.  I've considered manually compiling the latest development release of VLC in order to fix this issue but I'm not sure I want to go there or if this would even resolve the issue.  One answer suggests setting up a DBus query to get the play state of VLC and killing the process when it's done playing.  How would one go about setting up such a DBus query?  My system is running VLC 2.0.9 from ppa:videolan/stable-daily on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and all of the installed packages are updated to the latest versions.  Thanks.\n\nA: My solution written in C is what I settled on.  It is a daemon that uses the low level DBus API to call methods on VLC to get the playback status and ask VLC to quit if it is stopped.  The bash and python scripts were not reliable when run as Ubuntu Startup Applications, which is what I wanted.  IIRC, the bash and python versions had to be manually run from a terminal to work.\nBash solution using GDBus (was installed by default on my Ubuntu 12.04):\n#VLC Watchdog Bash Script (vlcwd.sh)\nwhile [ 1 -eq 1 ]\ndo\n    if [ \"$(pgrep vlc)\" != \"\" ] #if VLC is running\n        then #get the playback status and save to variable pbs\n        pbs=$(bash -c 'gdbus call --session \\\n        --dest org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.vlc-$(pgrep vlc) \\\n        --object-path /org/mpris/MediaPlayer2 \\\n        --method org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties.Get \\\n        \"org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player\" \\\n        \"PlaybackStatus\"')\n        if [ \"$pbs\" = \"(<'Stopped'>,)\" ] #if VLC is stopped\n        then kill -9 $(pgrep vlc) #then kill it so it doesn't block my screen saver\n        fi\n    fi\n    sleep 5\ndone\n\nPython\nThis is how I set up a DBus query to get the play state of VLC using Python and the python-dbus module:\nimport dbus\n\nbus = dbus.SessionBus()\nvlc_media_player_obj = bus.get_object(\"org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.vlc\", \"/org/mpris/MediaPlayer2\")\nprops_iface = dbus.Interface(vlc_media_player_obj, 'org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties')\npb_stat = props_iface.Get('org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player', 'PlaybackStatus')\n\n", "Q: How to manually remove a bad email message in Evolution I am using Evolution in Ubutu 12.04 LTS. I seem to have gotten a bad email message- when I opened it and Ctrl-I to see the images, Evolution hung up as it was \"formatting message\" and then hung up completely. Now whenever I click on that message in my inbox (I desperately want to delete it), same thing- lower bar say \"formatting message\", and all of Evolution grays out and hangs. Since clicking on this message to delete it immediately crashes Evolution, is there any other way to manually delete this message from by inbox? Thanks for any help you can offer.\nUpdate- never mind! After over one hour of trying different approaches, suddenly and through no result of my own efforts, this email message did not crash Evolution when clicked, so I could just delete it the usual way. If anyone has suggestions, I would be very curious as to why this behavior and why it resolved on its own. Thanks!\n\nA: It appears, you have it answered anyway, but I will add this:\n Mail in evolution is stored with folders and files in the home directory - these are in .local/share/evolution/mail/local/cur.\nSo if you had opened Nautilus (File Manager), pressed Ctrl+L, pasted in this and hit Enter:\n~/.local/share/evolution/\n\nIt would of taken you to that directory. Some of these files have names that begin with ., so you would also of needed to press Ctrl+H to view them.\nThen it is simply a matter of locating the email - the names are in this format:\n1389219028.4732_4390.COMPUTER-HOSTNAME:2,\n\nand are in date order, so if it had been a recent email it would of been easy to find. You can then open the suspect files in gedit (a text editor, so should have no effect on your system), and check the top lines against the entry in Evolution - e.g:\nReturn-Path: <do-not-reply@stackexchange.com>\n\nafter having found it to be the right one, right-lick and Delete it.\nNote Below: Pressing Delete in Evolution won't delete the files unless it is enabled to do so - you can still view it by going to the View menu , and then pressing Show Deleted Messages  - to get rid of it properly, go to the File menu , and then press Empty Trash. This will also remove any other messages you have deleted (should do anyway).\n", "Q: Unable to locate package libmysql++-dev root@avidgamers:~/warcraft/aG-HostbotRU/ghost# apt-get install libmysql++-dev\nReading package lists...

I can, however, download and install other packages that I need. It may not make a difference, but the server is located in Moscow, Russia. \n\nA: *\n\n*First of all, run apt-get update. If you get any errors, edit your post and include the output. If you don't get errors, try installing the package again.\n\n*If that doesn't work, check if you have universe repositories enabled: Open your software center and place your mouse cursor on the top of your desktop.

If it's not, then enable it and run apt-get update again and try installing the package again.\n\n*If that doesn't work too, you should probably try another mirror. Follow the instructions in 2 and change the \"Download from\" combobox. You can see a list of the mirrors with information on how updated it is here: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archivemirrors. That should help you choose one. Remember to choose one that's near you location.\nIf nothing of this works, edit your post including the contents of your /etc/apt/sources.list.\n\nA: The libmysql++-dev package is in the universe repository component. My guess is that it's not found because Universe isn't enabled on your system. So enable the universe repository, and you should be able to install it.\nIn general, when a package won't install even when it seems like you're doing all the right things, it's useful to make sure it's really available for the version of Ubuntu you're running, and what repository provides it. To do that, you can search for the package at http://packages.ubuntu.com/.\nIt's possible this is not the cause of the problem, of course.

Since I have an additional PC with Windows 7 that serves as my main tool, I have decided to try the latest Ubuntu 13.10 on the laptop, and have installed it from a DVD as a complete replacement for my previous OS. Linux is now the sole OS running on the laptop. However I have a few problems that I can't solve - I should point out that I am new to Linux.\n1) The laptop's bluetooth cannot be turned on. Linux states that it is turned off by a hardware switch, which is true - there is a bluetooth switch on the device, however no matter what I do the switch does not respond to being pressed at all. Note: Bluetooth was working on Windows 7 just yesterday and I have always kept it turned ON.\n2) I cannot connect to my wireless router. Enable Networking is ON if you click on the wifi icon up in the status bar. However, when going to System Settings and clicking Network, the new window opens only for a split second and then instantly closes, too fast to even read what it says.

This is probably something you could change.\nIf I'm understanding you correctly than an even simpler solution would be to use something like synapse to launch urls - which is a lot like QuickSilver. \nThe idea would be to press ctrl+space and begin typing a url wherever you are. You can then press enter which will automatically open the page in chrome if it has been set as your default browser.\nBy the way, synapse is not only good for this specific scenario but is a great tool in general to install and can greatly increase your productivity once you get used to it.\nIf you are using Kubuntu (like I am), then you can do the exact same thing with KRunner\n\nA: After digging through xdg-open (it uses the chrome url handlers to just run google-chrome with the url) and getting the front window with xprop, I came up with this command line (thanks for the xte tip @Seth):\n/opt/google/chrome/google-chrome about:blank ;\ncount=20;\nwhile [ $count -gt 0 ] \\\n      && ! xprop -id $(xprop -root _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW | awk '{print $NF}') WM_NAME \\\n      | grep -q about:blank; do\n  let count--;\n  sleep 0.1;\ndone;\nif [ $count -gt 0 ]; then\n  xte 'keydown Alt_L' 'keydown D' 'keyup Alt_L' 'keyup D';\nfi\n\nNot the nicest way of doing it, but it works.

(other hilghlights don't work as well, but I figured one picture would be sufficient)\n\n\nA: The difference in your screenshots is due to Vim using a different filetype for the two files being edited. The reason for this is most likely the name of the temporary file that sudoedit creates when editing.\nWhen comparing syntax highlighting differences between two Vim instances, the first thing to look for is the filetype variable that Vim sets automatically. You can check what the current filetype is by executing\n:set filetype?\n\nin Vim. You can also refer to the setting as ft for short. Vim should show a result on the status line, such as\n  filetype=sh\n\nVim has a large script of heuristics for setting the filetype automatically based on the file name, or sometimes on the file contents. If the name of the file is /etc/profile, for example, Vim sets the filetype to sh automatically.\nWhen you use sudoedit to edit /etc/profile, a temporary file is made, as shown in your ps listing. Since the name of this file doesn't match any of Vim's scripted rules, it attempts to set the filetype based on the content. Based on the screenshot, I would guess that Vim has set the filetype to conf, meaning a generic config file.\nPossible Solutions\nManual\nThere are a couple of ways to deal with this. First, you can set filetype manually every time you edit a file. To force sh syntax to be used, execute\n:set filetype=sh\n\nThe syntax highlighting rules should be reloaded and applied immediately.\nSyntax Hints\nAnother way is to add a hint to Vim in the content of files that you frequently edit that a particular filetype should be set. For example, if the first line of a file is #!/bin/sh, Vim will use the appropriate syntax regardless of what the file's name is. Note that this makes /etc/profile look like an executable shell script even though it is not, so you may or may not want to do something like this on your system.\nVim Modelines\nA third way is to force Vim to set the filetype variable by using what Vim calls \"modelines\". See :help modeline for more information. This involves adding a comment to your file that contains a string that Vim can parse for commands. Back to your example with /etc/profile, adding a comment like\n# vim: set filetype=sh\n\nwould instruct Vim to set the filetype properly when the file is edited regardless of its name.\n\nA: If you ever get different color behaviours between different user ids always, always first type \"which vi\" and see if what you're dealing with first. And then look at your .vimrc next assuming it's vim. If not, make sure you have this in your .bashrc\nalias vi='vim'\n\n", "Q: Where is my ruby installed when i install through RVM? right now i am running ruby 1.9 , which i installed using RVM .\nI needed that to run my redmine 2.4.2 , since i had trouble using 1.8.\nNow i need to configure my passenger mod to point to ruby 1.9 but i can't find it.\nright now its configured like this :\n<IfModule mod_passenger.c>\nPassengerRoot /usr\nPassengerRuby /usr/bin/ruby\nPassengerDefaultUser www-data\n</ifModule>\n\nand Since i get the same error as before, i guess it still uses my old 1.8 version.\nrunning ubuntu precise 12.04\nif you need additional information, please let me know.\n\nA: If you execute \n\nrvm info\n\non your command line, you will get all the information about where certain things are.

You can now also do the same with SIGHUP.\n\n\nA: The kill command really send a signal to the process... it's a bit misnamed. \nThe command \nkillall -SIGxxx name\n\nwill send the \"signal\" xxx to the process with name \"name\". Process in Unix can receive and handle a set of signals to respond to external events. By default kill send the signal SIGTERM that has the (predefined) effect of gracefully kill the process. (the SIGKILL signal will kill the process \"brutally\", this is the reason that sometime you need to use the killall -SIGKILL ... command). \nSome process have hardcoded meaning (for example: HUP is desconnection, etc. ) and are sometime sent by the kernel. USR1 and USR2 are user-definable signals.\nYou can even do that in scripts easily: if you put in a script the line \ntrap \"echo TRAPPED\" USR1\n\nthe script will print \"TRAPPED\" when you send the signal USR1 to it with the kill command. \nSo the answer to the last question is: \nEvidently, the \"tint2\" program has code that, upon receiving the signal USR1, will reload its configuration file. \nSee for example http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?signal+7\n", "Q: I can send mails from shell with PHP, but I can't send from the PHP web page I'm trying to send mails from a contact form in a page on my server.\nI followed this post.\nMy PHP file /var/www/my_project/test.php is this:\n<?php\n$myemail = \"my_mail@gmail.com\";\n$subject = \"my subject\";\n$message = \"my message \";\nmail($myemail, $subject, $message);\necho \"sent\";\n?>\n\nIf I run the PHP file from the shell:\nphp /var/www/my_project/test.php\n\nI receive the email in Gmail, then, I'm supposing ssmtp is well configured, right?\nBut if I run the PHP from the browser:\nhttp://localhost/my_project/test.php\n\nit doesn't send the mail and it creates this file with the email content:\n/var/www/dead.letter\n\nI did these steps too: \ncostales@server:~$ sudo cat /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini | grep sendmail\nsendmail_path = /usr/sbin/sendmail -t\ncostales@server:~$ sudo service apache2 reload\n\ncostales@server:~$ telnet smtp.gmail.com 587\nTrying 173.194.67.109...\nConnected to gmail-smtp-msa.l.google.com.\nEscape character is '^]'.\n220 mx.google.com ESMTP dm2sm7052263wib.8 - gsmtp\n\nAny idea please?

I received an error that said I can't login. So I went to the command line, typed in mysql -u root -p and when prompted for the password, entered it correctly. I then received the following error:\nERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)\n\nHere's the weird thing:\nI can't connect via mysql on the command line nor through phpMyAdmin, but all my WordPress sites are working fine. However, if I try to login with one of the WP sites' credentials, I get the same kind of error as above.\nI checked etc/mysql/my.cnf and saw: bind-address = 127.0.0.1. I tried to comment this out and restart mysql, no luck. I tried to change bind-address to localhost, and still no luck. Right now it's back to bind-address = 127.0.0.1. This is the same setting I have for a second Linode with the exact same private ip/networking settings as this one (I set both of their static IPs up at the same time), yet the other server is working fine (can connect to MySQL) and this one just seems to hate me.\nSo the big question is: What is causing mysql to no longer allow me to connect, why can my WordPress sites still use their credentials (but I can't via phpmyadmin nor the command line), and how can I prevent this from eluding me in the future? \nPossibly pertinent details:\n\n\n*\n\n*Two days ago I setup a private IP on this linode. \n\n*cat /etc/hosts does contain localhost\n127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain      localhost\n\n*ping localhost does return results:\nping localhost\nPING localhost.localdomain (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.\n64 bytes from localhost.localdomain (127.0.0.1): icmp_req=1 ttl=64 time=0.066 ms\n64 bytes from localhost.localdomain (127.0.0.1): icmp_req=2 ttl=64 time=0.062 ms\n\n\n*Rebooted recently for the first time in two months -- Could that have something to do with it? \n\n*It seems like the root password automagically just changed on me...\nThank you so much for helping me out.\n\nA: I ran across something similar to this, while setting up mysql.  MySQL doesn't consider localhost and 127.0.0.1 to be the same accessible address (despite documents often using them interchangeably).  The trick is, in your case getting connected to make changes to who can connect and how.  I'd try conncting to the loopback IP explicitly:\nmysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -p\n\nIf that doesn't work you'll have to dig through your wordpress settings to find the host, port, username and password settings.  The good news is if wordpress is working there is a way to get in.  \nOnce you're connected your problem is in the mysql database (use mysql) in the users table.  It's either that access control only allows one of 127.0.0.1/localhost/external IP, or anonymous users that are messing up your connections.\nTo see if you have any anonymous users:\nSELECT User,host from mysql.user;\n\nIf you see anything with blank @ localhost etc, that's them.

The hardware is an external 2TB bus powered USB disk.\nWhat I want is a RAID1 setup of 2x 1TB btrfs.\nIs this possible? How?\n__\nMotivation\nThe motivation for me to use RAID1 btrfs is because I just read an article talking about how such a setup would repair corrupted files automatically when the checksum on one volume fails.\nExample of what can happen with a .jpeg by just flipping one bit (I used vim for this. :%!xxd -b)\n \n\nA: This answer is a guide for showing how I got this going.\nMy setup is:\n\n\n*\n\n*1 external USB drive (1 enclosure with 1 drive)\n\n\nHow to:\n\n\n*\n\n*I created a GPT parition table with two equal sized primary btrfs partitions using gparted. Name the partitions whatever you want, the names will get lost anyway when creating the RAID.\n\n\n*Get the device ids:\n$ sudo btrfs filesystem show\nLabel: none  uuid: 607b4153-7aa9-444d-bc15-c5fe9038f255\n    Total devices 2 FS bytes used 28.00KB\n    devid    1 size 1.82TB used 2.03GB path /dev/sdc\n    *** Some devices missing\nLabel: 'Max'  uuid: b6647427-9f27-4157-b47b-77f74054b885\n    Total devices 1 FS bytes used 28.00KB\n    devid    1 size 931.49GB used 2.04GB path /dev/sdc1        // first one\nLabel: 'Moritz'  uuid: d0eaf97d-249e-4b7c-88a5-b60cc2d489d9\n    Total devices 1 FS bytes used 28.00KB\n    devid    1 size 931.49GB used 2.04GB path /dev/sdc2        // second one\n\n\n*Create the RAID:\n$ sudo mkfs.btrfs -L RAID-Datensicherung -m raid1 -d raid1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdc2\n\n\n*Since you can't write to it yet, you need to become the owner of the new device and change the permissions. Mount the device in nautiilus or however and then:\n$ cd /media\n$ sudo chown julien:julien RAID-Datensicherung\n$ sudo chmod 700 RAID-Datensicherung\n\n\n*Once you unmount and remount the device again, you can copy files via drag-and-drop.\n\n\nWhen mounting the device in nautilus two volumes show up, but only one of them will show as mounted.\n\nOnce you copy files to the disk from another external drive you'll see that write speed to the RAID volume is twice than the read speed from the other external device because of the raid mirroring.\n\nI still have to find out how to check if the self-healing works and will update this answer accordingly.\nUpdate 1\nUser @Oli is asking the related question about flipping just one bit. Just like him, I need to do this stealthy, i.e. no timestamps of my interaction or anything like that.\nIf you change one bit while the file-system is mounted, the change is registered and immediately mirrored. The changed/'corrupted' file is seen as a mere update - not as bitrot.\n\nA: I assume you use 2 external drives or 1 enclosure housing 2 or more drives. Theoretically it shouldn't matter if the devices are connected via USB or SATA, btrfs should be able to assemble the array once it finds the individual drives/partitions.\nYou should have a look at the btrfs kernel wiki. The first usecase seems to cover what you asked for:\nmkfs.btrfs -m raid1 -d raid1 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1\n\nBut I'm not sure about the selfhealing part.

When you boot in UEFI mode the installer on the flash drive also uses grub2 menu.\nYou should always be booting in UEFI mode unless you have one of the few systems that only boots in BIOS mode.\nYou should use Boot-Repair to convert your BIOS install to UEFI by uninstalling grub-pc and installing grub-efi. But have secure boot off. It looks like Boot-Repair also wants to install the secure boot versions which you can do if you want.\nDo not run 'buggy' UEFI until all other options are resolved. That is only for a few systems where vendor modifies UEFI (not per UEFI st'd) to only boot Windows.\nIf you get black screen after boot that is a different issue than booting.

It wouldn't be ideal - I wish it were system wide with an indicator with a clear icon of whether that hardware is in use (webcams too!), but this keyboard shortcut is an immediate measure.\nUnfortunately, this keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Audio Mute) seems to have no effect.  If I run the command from terminal, it works but just not as a keyboard shortcut.

I'm setting up a headless server, but I don't have ethernet access where I want to put it, so I need it to automatically connect to my WiFi network when it boots up (it has a wireless card). I can connect to an ethernet connection to set it up, but I need it to automatically connect to my access point from then on.  \nHow can I configure this?  \n\nA: I suggest a static IP address so that you can easily ssh and ftp into the server. Also, you can significantly simplify your file:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback  \n\nauto wlan0  \niface wlan0 inet static\naddress 192.168.1.125  \nnetmask 255.255.255.0\ngateway 192.168.1.1\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 192.168.1.1\nwpa-ssid <your_network>\nwpa-psk <your_key>\n\nBe certain the address is outside the range used by the router for DHCP and, of course, substitute your appropriate details here.\n\nA: After doing a lot of research I've gotten it working.  Since I have an Intel wireless card I didn't have to install any extra drivers, but you might have to, depending on the card you have.\nFirst you need to figure out what interface your wireless card is using. We use the iwconfig command for this:\niwconfig  \n\nIn my case my wireless card is the wlan0 interface, so I will be using that. Now we need to scan for wireless networks:\niwlist wlan0 s  \n\nThis should give lots of output, showing the details of the various wireless networks in your area. It's usually easier to filter by ESSID. grep helps us out here:\niwlist wlan0 s | grep ESSID  \n\nThis will list the names of all the wireless networks in your area.  Now it's time to connect to your network.\nUnsecure and WEP networks\nIf your network is unsecured or is secured by the older WEP (time to upgrade your security or router!) connecting is relatively simple. If your network is unsecured you should be able to connect with this:\niwconfig wlan0 essid NAME_OF_NETWORK  \n\nIf your network is WEP protected just add the key argument followed by your password, like this:\niwconfig wlan0 essid NAME_OF_NETWORK key PASSWORD  \n\nYou might have to run\ndhclient  \n\nTo get your router to assign you an IP address.\nWPA/WPA2\nWPA/WPA2 is a bit more complicated. You will need to use wpa_supplicant. First create the config file in /etc:\nsudo wpa_passphrase NETWORK_NAME NETWORK_PASSWORD > /etc/network/wpa_supplicant.conf  \n\nNow we need to connect:\nsudo wpa_supplicant -B -iINTERFACE_NAME -cPATH_TO_CONFIG -DDRIVER  \n\nFor example:\nsudo wpa_supplicant -B -iwlan0 -c/etc/network/wpa_supplicant.conf -Dwext  \n\n-B runs wpa_supplicant in the background. The wext driver should work in most cases. To see other drivers run:\nwpa_supplicant  \n\nFor more information on getting connected see How to connect and disconnect to a network manually in terminal?\nGet connected on startup\nNow we need to edit /etc/network/interfaces.  Open it in your favorite editor (vim, nano, etc); you'll need to use sudo.\nRemove everything except:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n(the loopback device). Now add:\nauto wlan0  \niface wlan0 inet dhcp  \n\npre-up <COMMAND> \n\nWhere wlan0 is your wireless interface and <COMMAND> is the command you use to connect to your network (see above).  For example if you're network is unsecured you would add:\npre-up iwconfig wlan0 essid some_network_name  \n\nIf your network is secured with WPA/2 you would add something like this:\npre-up sudo wpa_supplicant -B -iwlan0 -c/etc/network/wpa_supplicant.conf -Dwext  \n\nIf you're using wpa_supplicant you should also add:\npost-down sudo killall -q wpa_supplicant  \n\nSave the file, restart, unplug your ethernet and try running:\nsudo apt-get update\n\nIf the command completes successfully congratulations! You're online! If the command does not complete successfully please add a comment below.\nExamples and Explanations\nIf your network is unsecured or secured with WEP your /etc/network/interfaces should look similar to this now:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback  \n\nauto wlan0  \niface wlan0 inet dhcp  \n\npre-up iwconfig wlan0 essid some_network_name \n# note: if WEP secured you would also have a 'key' argument with your password\n\nIf your network is WPA/2 secured your /etc/network/interfaces should look similar to this:\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback  \n\nauto wlan0  \niface wlan0 inet dhcp  \n\npre-up sudo wpa_supplicant -B -iwlan0 -c/etc/network/wpa_supplicant.conf -Dwext  \n\npost-down sudo killall -q wpa_supplicant  \n\nNow an explanation.\n\n*\n\n*auto wlan0: Starts the wlan0 interface automatically.\n\n\n*iface wlan0 inet dhcp: Gets us an IP address through DHCP\n\n\n*pre-up: Specifies the command(s) to get the connection going.\n\n\n*post-down: Specifies the command(s) to be used to clean up after ourselves (if necessary).\nSources:\n\n*\n\n*A wireless, headless Linux box\n\n\n*How to connect and disconnect to a network manually in terminal?\n\n\n*Personal experience and lots of tinkering.\n", "Q: Can I use Ubuntu installers partition tool (Win 8.1 and Ubuntu 13.04) I have laptop less than year old with preinstalled Windows 8 (now updated to 8.1).

I have to use software for both systems. I know Virtual Box can do the same thing, but it is very slow for my computer. So is it possible. If yes, how to implement? Any suggestion will be appreciated. Thank you!\n\nA: Since my response was getting quite long, I felt it better to post as a new answer, rather than as another comment.\nJust install them as two physical drives, and make sure you select the right one during install (i.e. so you're not overwriting the first OS with the second). What I'd do is leave one installed in your case but unplugged (the Windows installer isn't as high powered or intelligent as Ubiquity or an Ubuntu live medium), install Windows as normal to that disk, then shut down, plug in the new disk whilst leaving the first plugged in still, and boot the live installer for Ubuntu. \nYou'll need to choose a disk which is your \"main\" disk, because the bootloader needs to go on this disk. In times gone past, this was called a \"master/slave\" set up, I'm not sure if that still applies.\n\nA: Sure you can. What you're talking about is generally called RAID, which has two main types:\nRAID 0 (i.e. stripping - a file is broken into two smaller parts and one sent to each disk, which improves read time)\nRAID 1 (i.e. mirroring) - where a file is copied to BOTH disks, for the sake of redundancy (often used on servers).\nMost modern motherboards are capable of RAID, usually at boot there will be an option to press something like Ctrl+I to enter into a simple utility (very BIOS like) for creating a RAID array.\nOnce that's done, your OS would 'see' the disks as on single entity - it helps to have two identical disks e.g. of 250GB (so the array is 2x250GB = 500GB). All you'd do then is at installation use a partitioning tool like KPart or GParted to format the disks as you wanted.\nAlthough my setup isn't current RAID (my workhorse computer is a laptop), I do dual boot. The balance I've found that works best is a tiny Ubuntu partition (or pair of partitions for / and /home) of 30GB (10+20), with all my data being on the Windows partition (which takes up the rest of my disk).\nEDIT: It should be noted that technically RAID 0 has a reputation for halving the MTBF of your hard disks. However, given that that is usually thousands of hours, when I did run a RAID array, I never ran into problems. I left home (and that particular machine) behind before it finally gave out, after 5/6 years of heavy use!\n", "Q: Unable to remove/uninstall Ubuntu from a MacBook I recently received an old MacBook from my brother. He had installed some version of Ubuntu on it. I haven't been able to use it since it's completely foreign to me. Therefore, I decided to uninstall it. The problem is; it doesn't seem to be away to reach the bios on start-up. Something called Yaboot appears on screen and I have no clue what to do with that.

This works because /home has a subdirectory for each user's settings and files which contain all the data & settings of that user. Also, fresh installs for linux typically like to wipe whatever partition they are being installed to so either the data & settings need to be backed-up elsewhere or else avoid the fuss each time by having /home on a different partition. \nYou can read more about here\n\nA: If you format your system, then yes, you will use that data.

I am using webfsd, a lightweight HTTP daemon, to serve static content to http://localhost:80 as follows:\nsudo webfsd -R ~/Documents/www/ -p 80 -f index.html\n\nBut I have to run this from the command line every time. I assume I can't add sudo commands to Startup Programs. So, how can I make it run without having to invoke it every time?\n(I would prefer it to start at boot up, and be accessible without me having to log in, even if this means I need to move the location of the files. But starting when I log in is an acceptable second place prize. If it makes a difference, I would like to experiment later with HTTPS.)\n\nA: My first idea was a simple upstart script. /etc/init/webfs.conf:\ndescription \"WebFS server\"\nstart on (local-filesystems and net-device-up)\nrespawn\nexec webfsd -F -p 80 -u d3vid -g d3vid /home/d3vid/Documents/www/ -f index.html\n\nThe -u and -g arguments are really important. These drop root privileges after binding the port... Which means there's not a net-accessible process running as root that can be exploited.\nThe other idea is running it on a high port (>1024) as you, auto-starting that however you like... And then either using a real server to reverse proxy (nginx is a common and lightweight tool here) from port 80... Or just use an iptables redirect.\niptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 10010 -j ACCEPT\niptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 10010\n\nThe advantage there is webfs is never running as root... But then you're just left with needing to run the iptable commands as root every boot. Swings and roundabouts.\nI think on balance, if you're not exposing the server to the internet directly, the first route is probably safe enough.\nBut if you're going any further, dump WebFS and just use nginx...\n\n*\n\n*It does everything WebFS does (and a whole lot more)\n\n*It's simple to use\n\n*It's efficient beyond reason\n\n*Its SSL has decent documentation\n\n*Most importantly, lots of people have a vested interest in nginx remaining secure, including Canonical, so you'll get updates for it fast (critical when dealing with web-facing things)\n\nTo give you some sort of idea what efficient means, I have a webserver hosting around 20 domains, a few of them do some pretty serious traffic. nginx's four worker processes account for 15MB of RAM combined and no observable CPU time. It's insane.\n", "Q: Where to check if a cron job was ever run? I set a few cron jobs locally on my machine.

I tried following the Internet how-to guide to connect to my ISP, but I got stuck after the instruction to run sudo pppoeconf. It asks for my ISP account password, when I try to enter it, no text appears on the screen, and when I press enter, it says that the password is incorrect. But, I am sure that the password is the same one I am using in Windows 7.\nPlease let me know how to proceed further?\n\nA: Just follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check that the ethernet cable is properly connected\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*Run sudo pppoeconf\n\n*Enter root password\n\n*Answer all the question that will be asked with an answer \"Yes\"\n\n*Finally type pon dsl-provider\nTo stop connection run poff dsl-provider\n\nA: You need to be root to setup a pppoe connection with pppoeconf. Try this code in a terminal window:\nsudo pppoeconf\n\nYou're saying that you can't see the field for typing the password, and maybe you should exit to console terminal (pressCtrl+Alt+F1) and login as user which is your username for Ubuntu, and then try to run command sudo pppoeconf to see what happens.\nAfter setup for pppoe configuration begins, you are told what to do next step by step. You should use the default settings suggested in pppoeconf for MTU, DNS servers and so on (press YES each time you are asked for it). You can change these settings later on if you have to, there are plenty of tutorials for that. Also, when asked if you want internet connection to be triggered at start-up press YES, it makes things easier for you.\nPppoeconf asks you for both your username and the password assigned to you by you Internet service provider, the same that you use in Windows 7 when you setup your Internet connection. First type in your username, press OK, and at next screen you should be able to type your 'password' and press OK again. \nPppoeconf tool for Internet configuration and Gnome network Manager are somehow conflicting one with each other so you have to remove 'gnome network manager' before using pppoeconf or you can forget about pppoeconf and setup a new DSL connection using gnome network manager which allows you to make a new PPPOE connection in the DSL section (press ADD button to make a new ppp connection, and then use your username and password, same as in WIN7).\nDefault commands for starting and stoping a connection configured with pppoeconf are:\nsudo pon dsl-provider (this one starts or restarts your DSL connection)\nsudo poff dsl-provider (this one stops your DSL connection)\nYou should remember these commands because it could happen after reboot to see that Internet is not working even if your DSL connection is up and running. To solve this problem you must stop connection in a terminal, and then restart it, and that is why you need to remember how to start and stop a DSl connection configured with pppoeconf.\nGood luck with this one, I know it is a little bit confusing for the moment but you made the right choice. You get more speed for your Internet connection and better results with pppoeconf than with Gnome Network Manager and its DSL connection.\n\nA: You have to ask your ISP about the configuration parameters of the router. Most of the time, the routers are configured by opening a browser (i.e. Firefox) and entering 192.168.1.1 (or any address asigned to the router). Once in, you have to type the admin username and password, then you'll be able to configure the router properly using its interface (GUI). But, remember, first of all, call/contact your ISP and ask for the configuration parameters.\nAdmin username and password is the same no matter if you're on Windows or Ubuntu, because you are configuring the router not your system.\n", "Q: ASUS Z87 Pro Bluetooth not finding other devices with 13.10 Ubuntu 13.10 installed on a machine with ASUS Z87 Pro motherboard, which ships with it's \"Wi-Fi GO!\" wireless networking built in, which is based on a Qualcomm Atheros AR9462 Wireless Network Adapter (includes WiFi + Bluetooth 4 capabilities).\nI can turn on Bluetooth, scan for devices, but it never finds anything.

I went to even think about compiling latest Bluez version because I thought it was not drivers. But after testing Kernel 3.14 and 3.15 I found out that the Bluetooth was working. My smartphone detected the Asus Bluetooth and vice versa.\nSo starting with the Kernel 3.14.x bluetooth support will be available for the Asus Z87-Pro\nIf you do wish to try it out (Be warned, this could create other problems. None for me at the moment but if I do get one I'll jump to 3.13): You need to go to http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/ and search for the 3.14 kernel or even 3.15. Since I have the 14.04 64-bit version I used the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Kernel 3.14.1\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux Header 64 Bit\n\n*Linux Header Generic\n\n*Linux Image\n\n\n*Kernel 3.15 RC2\n\n\n*\n\n*Linux Header 64 Bit\n\n*Linux Header Generic\n\n*Linux Image\nFor more information regarding the Network changes since 3.14 you can look in: Kernel Newbies\nAfter you have downloaded the DEB packages you need (Look in the respective folder for the actual ones you need). Then put them all inside the same folder and run the following command inside that folder:\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nThis will install each DEB package found in that folder. The following image shows Ubuntu 14.04 working correctly with the Bluetooth (Using any kernel from 3.14 and above). Ubuntu 14.10 simply works out of the box:\n\nThe image is using a Samsung headphone (HM1200).

What is the easiest/best way to share my screen (and preferably sound) from my Ubuntu laptop to my RPi (running OpenElec / XBMC)\nMy goal is to be able to play games on my ubuntu laptop without needing to hook it up to my TV set and amplifier each time. The raspberry is already connected to them and I can use AirPlay from my Ipad without trouble, so it would seem possible to do something similar from Ubuntu.   \n\nA: Do a Google search on VNC and go from there.\nIn short: you need a vnc-server running on your Ubuntu laptop and a vnc-client on the Pi\n", "Q: Change multiple filenames by replacing a character I have multiple files named like that : screenshot 13:25.png\nWindows struggle to open these files probably because of the \":\".\nHow can I replace it?\n\nA: In a terminal, cd into the right directory and then run this.\nrename 's/\\:/-/g' *.png -vn\n\nThis will preview the renaming. It should replace : with -.\nIf that looks right, remove the n from the end and then it will do the actual renaming.\nNote: Ubuntu versions above 17.04 don't ship with rename, but it's still available in the default repositories, so use sudo apt install rename to obtain it\n\nA: If you prefer a GUI, install pyrenamer:\nsudo apt-get install pyrenamer\n\nThen run it:\npyrenamer\n\nIt has dozens of options for patterns and renaming formats.\n\nA: Here's a pure bash solution:\nfor i in *:*; do\n    mv -- \"$i\" \"${i//:/_}\"\ndone\n\nThe ${var//pattern/replacement} format will replace all occurrences of pattern with replacement in the variable $var. For more information on bash's string maipulation capabilities, see here.\nIf you want to do this for multiple characters, you could simply place them in a character class. So, for example, to replace all of ;,:,=,+,%,, with underscores, you could do:\n$ ls \n1foo:bar  2foo:bar:baz  3foo;bar  4foo=bar  5foo%bar  6foo,bar  7foo+bar\n$ for i in *; do mv -- \"$i\" \"${i//[:;=%,+]/_}\"; done\n$ ls\n1foo_bar  2foo_bar_baz  3foo_bar  4foo_bar  5foo_bar  6foo_bar  7foo_bar\n\nBasically, the idea is that [ ] means any of the characters listed. So, by placing all of the characters you want to replace in the character class, all of them are dealt with at once.\nThe -- after mv signifies the end of options and is needed so that this will work even for file names beginning with - which otherwise would have been treated as options passed to mv.\n\nFor the specific characters you asked for, things are a bit more complex because some of them need to be escaped (I am ignoring the / since *nix doesn't allow it in file names any more than Windows does so that won't be an issue):\n$ ls\n1foo<bar  2foo>bar  3foo:bar  4foo\\bar  5foo|bar  6foo*bar  7foo?bar  8foo\"bar  9foo'bar\n$ for i in *; do mv -- \"$i\" \"${i//[<>:\\\\|*\\'\\\"?]/_}\"; done\n$ ls\n1foo_bar  2foo_bar  3foo_bar  4foo_bar  5foo_bar  6foo_bar  7foo_bar  8foo_bar  9foo_bar\n\nNote that I escaped the \\,' and \" by adding a \\ in front of each.\n\nA: I prefer GUI but as a Nautilus Extension, i.e. Nautilus Actions Extra:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:nae-team/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-actions-extra\nnautilus -q\n\n(See www.webupd8.org/2011/12/nautilus-actions-extra-pack-of-useful.html)\nThen when you select files to be renamed and click Rename from the context menu, you are offered many options for renaming files.\n\nA: The renameutils package has a handy program called qmv which provides interactive batch renaming. You run it on a directory or a list of files, and it generates a temporary text file containing their file names, and starts your favourite editor. When you exit the editor, any file names you changed are renamed accordingly. qmv turns a batch rename problem into a text editing problem.\nIn this case, you can use qmv -f do *:* to edit the names of all the files containing a colon, and then the :%s/:/_/g command in Vim (or a corresponding search-and-replace in whatever editor you use).\nThe -f do option sets the format of the text file to have the destination file-name only, which makes the search-and-replace simpler. The default format has two copies of the file name on each line, and you edit only the second one. That allows it to do the right thing if you've deleted or reordered lines in the file, but it's not always the easiest. There are other formats too.\nWith qmv, you can instead choose to pipe the generated file through a command of your choice, such as sed, if you don't want the interactive capability.\n\nA: And here is a Nautilus Script that replaces (all?) Windows-incompatible characters with  a hyphen in all selected file names (based on the answer by terdon ;-)\n#!/bin/bash\nfilesall=\"\"\nwhile [ $# -gt 0 ]\n    do\n        files=`echo \"$1\" | sed 's/ /\\?/g'`\n        filesall=\"$files $filesall\"\n        shift\n    done\nfor i in $filesall; do mv \"$i\" \"${i//[<>:\\\\|*\\'\\\"?]/-}\"; done\n\n\nA: Thunar (the XFCE file-manager) has a nice build in feature for bulk renaming of files. It has options for removing/replacing characters, search and replace, numbering files and more.\nInstall thunar:\nsudo apt-get install thunar\n\nOpen thunar, browse to your files, select them and and choose 'rename' (via context menu or F2)\n\nA: @echo off\necho.\necho.

More than a year ago I have installed 10.04, then I upgraded many times (10.04 -> 12.04 -> 13.04 -> 13.10) and during my first year with Linux I have installed lots of junk apps, changed the desktop environment a few times and now my OS seems to be very slow and I have many bugs, too.\nThe problem is that it's a bit difficult to format everything because I have a Windows partition and there are some important things there, my /home folder also contains important files.\nSo, is there a fast way to install 13.10, removing all old apps, dependencies and scripts, but without affecting either the windows partition or my /home folder?\n\nA: Considering your set up. I would back up my home folder first.\nStart new blank installation, on screen where system is asking to where to install Ubuntu choose something else, \n\nthan in new screen that pops up chose partition and mount point for your Ubuntu partition and install fresh copy of Ubuntu. \nRemaining partitions will remain untouched. When installation finalized use your backup to return important files in your home directory\nAs always when playing with partitions make good backup of all important files on Windows and Ubuntu partition, just in case. I mostly have everything important backed up in at least 2 different external HDD.\n\nA: It is in fact possible to install 13.10, removing all old apps, dependencies and scripts (scripts not in /home that is), but without affecting either the windows partition or /home.\n\n\n*\n\n*First, as everyone says, back up your data (documents, photos, etc). I wouldn't bother to back up hidden configuration files in your /home since you want to reset all of that anyway.\n\n*Use sudo blkid or gparted to be sure you know what partitions contain / and Windows. Look for recovery or other Windows partitions that you may need to be sure are kept. Write it all down.\n\n*Do not choose the option to Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7. You want the option that says Something else.\n\n*You will then enter the partitioner. Choose to mount the partition that contains root as /, but (cue the ominous music)...do not check the box to format the partition. \n\n*Not formatting the partion to be mounted as / is the key part. If you do not format the partition it will not overwrite /home.\nThat said, it may be better - after backing up - to just reformat the drive and do a clean install anyway. \nYou have been good about updating, and each update should reconfigure various config files hidden in /home as needed, so there shouldn't be any hidden time bombs from bad/old config files hanging around. \nBut your stated concern is speed and general clunkiness. Why risk ending up with the same problems from a hard to debug config issue?\nI would also recommend using Something else to do this (but now checking the box to reformat /). The option to Install alongside works well in most cases, but it takes the control away from you and lets the installer make the decisions. This is especially a potential problem if you have Windows data or recovery partitions to preserve.\n", "Q: blank terminal and default theme is lost in ubuntu I am using Ubuntu 12.04.

It will be made online in future (~1 or 2 years) but for now it is locally used. I have gone through some tutorials (here) to set up a LAMP web server. The usage is expected to be as follows\n\n\n*\n\n*Used for: Drupal Web Applications \n\n*Current Users: 15\n\n*Prospected Users (in a year): 60 (some over internet)\n\n*Files upload/download: min. 10 files daily per user\n\n*I do need constant back of all my data on server\n\n\nWhat should be the server hardware specifications for my scenario? Do I really need to have SSD for fast IO operations or should I go for RAID? How much RAM? What about network card? Please it would be really helpful if anyone can point to a articles that explains these specifics.\n\nA: 15-60 users — even concurrently, which I assume this isn't — is not a busy site. You could get away with low-end hardware. If you've got a spare box in the office, that would do. You could probably even host it in a virtual machine on one of the existing desktops.\nI would be against purchasing anything until you've got some sort of idea how the setup actually runs. Every website is different. How much they churn the database and filesystem differs. How much RAM they use differs. Get it running somewhere and see where the bottlenecks are.\nThe main problem is the backup process. It's not automatic and requires you to know what you're doing (you'll want to go through a dry and ideally a wet run before a real crash). They'll need to be stored off the server, ideally off-site. What happens if a meteor hits? What happens if you're standing next to the server when a meteor hits you both? Are there instructions on how to restore to new hardware? Is this all secure?\nThere's also a question about maintenance. You set this up and you're typically responsible for its uptime. It's not just software, hardware does blow up every so often. And the power consumption. And if you're making this internet-accessible, your upstream bandwidth at the office might not suffice.\nI'd personally be looking to test locally but deploy to an off-site third party. There are thousands of VPS hosts (Linode, Digital Ocean, etc) that won't charge you more than $10-20 a month for a regularly backed-up service.\nAnd then there's the software maintainance. If you're using popular open source software (like Drupal), the most important thing is keeping the thing updated. If you don't, your server will be compromised. That most commonly means hosting crapware to infect other people, send spam... But if can also mean the wholesale theft of customer data.\nIf you don't know what you're doing, and can't afford to learn, don't host stuff on the internet. Pay somebody to manage it for you. This typically means either paying for a website hosting account (often cheaper than VPS access) or paying for a managed server (typically +~$100/month on top of the hardware lease). They come with support and it's often worth it just for the peace of mind.\n", "Q: Chromebook install Ubuntu but I can not to start Ubuntu.

The last time I tried to install it it worked but I had an internet problem. In any case, I don't think it's gonna be possible for you to install it because, in the guide, the guy says that he doesn't know how to change the amount of space you give ubuntu after install.

I am currently a student doing my 4th year at college passing 3 separate courses, My issue is that when I finish my course I will need to get a job or some sort of way to get income, I was thinking on going into freelance website design but that is a different story, I love Ubuntu and I love the design and purpose of it, I was wondering if Canonical does some sort of apprenticeships ? I am sure if I had that on my CV it would make my job hunting much more easier. Experience is my only downfall right now considering I have the qualifications having something like that on my job application would lead to better and more fulfilling jobs, \n\nA: I can't speak for Canonical but in the wider Ubuntu community, there are many projects that are part of Ubuntu which fall into Google's Summer of Code.\nEssentially, Google sponsors open source projects to hire students over summer. It's not a small amount of money either but it lacks some of the formal structure that you might be looking for. I can't say whether or not that sort of experience  will directly help but it would certainly make you a better developer.\nIf you want to go and work at Canonical HQ, I guess the best way to find out is to contact them and ask. Their new website isn't that handy for finding HR contact details, but their main switchboard number is +442076302400. Give it a shot. The worst that can happen is they say no.\nOtherwise, there are actual job vacancies at Canonical. Again, I can't speak for Canonical but they might be willing to take on junior devs. Worth a shot.\n", "Q: confused about ubuntu / xubuntu releases Initially I had Ubuntu installed, but later I switched to xubuntu by installing the xfce desktop, and removed the ubuntu-desktop, but now I`m confused about the release update because the updater says that there a new update: Ubuntu 13.10 'Saucy Salamander' and if I look in the sysinfo app it says that I have Ubuntu 13.04 (raring), Gnome 3.6.3, but I have Xubuntu.\nif I do the update, then it will switch back to the ubuntu-desktop, or how can I make the Xubuntu release update without installing the ubuntu-desktop?\nThank you\n\nA: Ubuntu and Xubuntu both share the same repositories, so no matter what desktop environment you have installed, it will upgrade to the next release.\nIf the upgrade goes well after doing:\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nYou will still have your Xubuntu, or what is the same, your Ubuntu with the xfce desktop.\n\nA: Changing the desktop doesn't change the version of Ubuntu or any of it's \"flavors\" (Xubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, etc), but the different desktop environments have their own numbers.\nI use Xubuntu 12.04, for example, but my desktop is Xfce4.8. In Xubuntu 13.10 the desktop is Xfce4.10!  The desktop versions don't always keep pace with the 'buntu versions.\nWhen you update your computer, everything (including all installed desktops) is updated according to the Ubuntu version (Precise 12.04, Raring 3.10, etc) you have installed.\nI hope that is helpful.\n", "Q: How to change a password How do I change my password in ubuntu?

Thank you!\n\n\nA: According to this post on the Play On Linux forums, this error can be caused by having different languages set for the LANG and LC_* variables.\nYou can check these variables by typing locale into the Terminal. \nA solution for this is to force Play On Linux to run in English.\nThis can be achieved by running this command in the Terminal:\nLC_ALL=C playonlinux\n\nMore information on the LC_ALL command can be found here.\n", "Q: qemu-img: error while reading sector 327680: Invalid argument I am trying to convert vmdk image to raw format but I am getting an error statement. \nqemu-img convert -f vmdk Ubuntu-12.04-LTS-Jeos-1.0-disk1.vmdk -O raw myImage.raw\nand I am getting following error.\nqemu-img: error while reading sector 327680: Invalid argument\nHowever it creates myImage.raw image with 0 disk size.

Now every time I try to open the terminal I get the same message and it force quits. I really need some help here and keep in mind that I cant actually use the terminal to fix this. \n\nA: You likely corrupted your ~/.bashrc. Make a backup copy of that file if you have personalized settings in it, then copy /etc/skel/.bashrc to ~/.bashrc to overwrite it. Don't forget that the filename starts with a .  so it is hidden in nautilus, so press CTRL+H in nautilus to show the hidden files.\nOr if you know about bash scripting then you just have to correct the problem in ~/.bashrc with any text editor.\n(Or you paste contents of that file here so wee can look into it.)\n", "Q: I don't have any OS I am having some issues with my hard disk on my laptop so I am changing it.

You can install any OS as the first (and only) OS, Ubuntu is no different.\nJust boot from an Ubuntu CD and install normally. You might have problems if you later install Windows and that overwrites Ubuntu's boot loader (grub2) but that it a completely different issue. If you do eventually run into this problem you can fix it by reinstalling grub as described here: \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows\n\nA: Yes definitely you can install as like you install Windows in the laptop which does not contain any OS. And also you have broke the installation CD. You can install Ubuntu from Pendrive.\n\nA: Yes, you can.\nSimply install Ubuntu from a USB Flash drive or a DVD. But you would need another computer to make a bootable flash disk or to burn the DVD.\nIf you want to create the bootable flash drive from Windows you can use one of these tools:\n\n\n*\n\n*Rufus\n\n*UII\nActually, there are a lot more.\nAlso, keep in mind that installing Windows after Ubuntu will overwrite Ubuntu Bootloader, but you can always restore it.\n", "Q: How to install virtualbox (Ubuntu Trusty Tahr ) I've trying to install virtual box from official ppa (this guide https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads) but then i trying to install\nsudo apt-get install virtualbox-4.3 \n\nReading package lists...

So my Ubuntu is running as virtual machine just fine with a few programs and development tools. But I now need to run in the Ubuntu environment some processes which require heavy processing and memory, so I would love to run them not in a virtual machine but as host operating system with the full resources available.\nIs it possible to configure the machine to boot from that VHD I'm already using?\nI have seen several posts on how to install a new Ubuntu with dual boot, configure dual boot inside a virtual machine, etc. I'v seen some MSDN post about booting from VHD, but that works only for Windows and it requires Windows Enterprise edition. I couldn't find anything for booting Ubuntu straight from a VHD. Is it possible? How?\n\nA: You can boot from a VHD file using the windows 7/8 boot manager.\nSee the technet article Deploy a Virtual Hard Disk for Native Boot, Step 4: Deploy the VHD with native-boot capabilities.\nBest regards,\nShocky\n\nA: You can use Ventoy to boot vdisk file (vhd/vdi/raw ... with a Linux distro in it) on a real machine.\nBoth Legacy BIOS and UEFI are supported. The advantages of this model are:\n\n*\n\n*The Linux OS runs on a physical machine, not in a virtual machine, so there is no loss inefficiency.\n\n*The Linux OS does not need a disk or partition, just in a file.\nFor example, Windows is your main OS, and you put some Ubuntu/Debian/Arch...

I want to intentionally damage a file in order to test the claims that btrfs can heal itself. The article talks about taking the filesystem off, damaging a photo by \"flipping\" a single bit and then remounting it. In older filesystems this would just be corrupted but it's supposed to fix itself in btrfs. In theory, this makes sense but I really want to test it.\nThe problem is the article doesn't explain how to do any of that.\nHow would I go about changing a single bit in a very specific part of a filesystem?\nI should also point out that this must be done on an offline filesystem so that btrfs doesn't see my write as intentional.\nEdit: While the question (and discussion) talks a lot about btrfs, I'd like to know if there are filesystem independant methods of implementing this sort of corruption (so that it can be compared across different RAID types/controllers/etc).\n\nA: You could try a small program that will perform FIBMAP ioctl(2) on the opened file.\nBy quick web search, I found this blog post http://smackerelofopinion.blogspot.tw/2009/06/fibmap-ioctl-file-system-block-number.html detailing how to do this - it will even give you a link to a sample program that you can compile and run yourself.\n$ git clone git://kernel.ubuntu.com/cking/debug-code\n$ cd debug-code/block-mapper-fibmap\n$ make\n$ sudo ./fibmap /path/to/your/image-file.jpg\n\nThis is exactly the way hdparm --fibmap (mentioned by @falconer) is implemented.\nAfter finding the block numbers you could employ dd gongfu to modify the file, like @gertvdijk sketched out. Or maybe you could just modify the fibmap.c program above to do the bit flip for you, directly writing to the device file bypassing the file system layer (three parameters for the program: 1. the path to the file, 2. device file containing the file system, 3. offset and bit you want to modify).\n(Disclaimer: I have not tested and cannot guarantee that the FIBMAP ioctl(2) will work for a file in loopback device or btrfs file system, but I would strongly expect it does. I am guessing hdparm will check the device type before performing the ioctl(2) on the file and is hence failing.)\n\nA: sudo hdparm --fibmap /PATH/TO/FILE\n\nwill give you the LBAs where the file is located. After this you can use @gertvdijk 's answer.\n\nA: I'm not an expert, but the btrfs-progs package actually includes a tool specifically to do this, although you may have to build from source. In any case, once you have installed or built btrfs-progs, you should be able to use the tool btrfs-corrupt-block, which is used by the btrfs developers to test the filesystem.\nNow, like I said, I haven't had a lot of time to play around with btrfs, so I don't know the exact usage of this tool. But with it, you should be able to corrupt an offline filesystem, which will be fixed when the corrupted file is read (assuming that you have set up RAID or something so that there's another copy to use).\n\nA: @Oli - hi, I'm Jim Salter, the guy who actually wrote that article.  I was working with a virtual machine, which made things simpler.  What I did is started out with a JPEG file, and opened it up in a hex editor.  The particular one that I used was Bless, which you can install in Ubuntu with a simple apt-get install bless.\nAfter opening up the JPEG in Bless, I hit page down a few times to get well into the \"meat\" of the JPEG, and then just highlighted about fifty bytes worth of data, and copied and pasted it into a text editor (in my case, gEdit).  This gave me something to search for.\nNow I saved the JPEG into each array on the VM.  The storage behind the arrays were a series of .qcow2 files.  Once I'd saved the JPEG into the arrays, I could load the .qcow2 files associated with each array into Bless, and search them - they weren't very large, being nothing but the JPEG and some metadata - for that fifty byte pattern I'd highlighted and copied out of the JPEG.  Voila, I had the block to corrupt!  At this point, I could just manually edit individual bytes of the JPEG as stored on the VM's virtual disk using Bless - and, importantly, do so in exactly the same way on each array.\nThe only wrinkle is that in the case of the RAID5 array tested in the article, I had to make sure I edited the actual copy of the data in the stripe, and not the parity for the stripe itself - it was a small image on an otherwise empty array, so there wasn't any data in the FOLLOWING block in the stripe, making the parity block contain the data unaltered from the data block.  If I'd accidentally edited the parity block instead of the data block, the image would have shown up as unchanged.\nOne final note - you don't NEED virtual machines to do this - you could do the same things in the same ways with bare metal; it would just be more of a pain in the butt because you'd need to work with entire raw drives instead of with nice small .qcow2 files, and you'd either have to pull the drives and put them in a different machine, or boot into a live (or just alternate) environment to mess with them.  (I tested ZFS's data healing in exactly this way, but on real bare metal machines, 7-ish years ago when I first got interested in next-gen filesystems.)\nHope this helps!\n\nA: *\n\n*Get the value of a single sector on the block device (e.g. /dev/sda1) with an offset of 1 million sectors offset (just an example):\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/root/mysector bs=512 count=1 skip=1M\n\nThis arbitrary chosen 1M * 512 bytes offset is just to make sure you're out of the metadata part of the filesystem and actually on a sector which contains data.\n\n*Edit the raw sector data by changing the content with a hex editor.

The asorti function is a GNU awk extension.\n\nA: You can also download the gawk source code files from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gawk and then proceed to compile them. This approach may be useful if you want to use a specific version of gawk other than the one provided by the gawk package in Ubuntu's repositories.\nAfter downloading the source code, extract the files in a given directory /home/user/gawk/ and then:\ncd /home/user/gawk\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nMost probably it will be installed in something like /usr/local/bin/gawk-4.X.Y, being X and Y numbers that change on every new release.\n", "Q: Uninstalling Issue I installed ubuntu through a Usb stick.

You should look, by yourself, for the replacement of somePackage (if the package was in the official repositories, it's very likely that there's a empty package that points to the replacement), in case the package has been renamed, or forget about it, in case you are trying to get a package that was removed from the repositories for any motive.

When I asked the question before (Mount my Webserver as a drive in Win7/8) I was told to use version control software but I don't want to be downloading a local copy and working on it so that I then have to upload the new version and re-download the new version to all the machines. There's no group of developers here just me and most of my dev/debug issues come from writing code and testing it one machine but then forgetting to update my other machines. Thus I want a sync'd copy of the files on all of my machines.\nI was considering using ownCloud on one of my webservers for other reason anyways and gives my Win machines easy access to the files. My Win machines have the ownCloud update client that works like Google Drive's or DropBox's with sync'ing happening on what appears to be a timer. The ownCloud update client on my Ubuntu machines didn't want to install and I'm using a mix of desktop and server versions. So my Ubuntu machines simply mount the ownCloud directory via davfs2 and (in once I get this worked out) they will use rsync on a cron to create a local copy - that way my machines can continue to work if the server with the ownCloud files goes down.\nBut then I ran across mention of Unison which I'd never heard of before. It seems that Unison is a program meant to do the same thing as differential rsync. Have I misunderstood?\nUnison sounds like it is built for syncing files across servers so I wouldn't have to worry about keeping the remote server's mount up and running or re-establishing the mount before executing a differential rsync. However, all of the tutorials I'm finding on Unison suggest that you have to open up SSH to root logins. Maybe I'm worried about nothing but that seems like a bad idea.\nQuestions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Am I correct that allowing a root login on SSH is a bad idea for security reasons?\n\n*Are there advantages to Unison that I've overlooked?\n\n*Are there issues with rsync that I've overlooked? Such as wiping out my local copy if the mount of the remote server goes down and now the directory looks empty.\n\n*Are there performance advantages to Unison over rsync or vice versa?\n\n*Finally, is there a way to monitor mounts and re-establish automatically if they die? I could use write something to check for specific contents on the mount but that seems prone to problems.\n\n\nThanks\n\nA: Choose Unison if what you want is two way synchronization, it is better suited for those scenarios; although achievable in rsync as well.  \n\n\n*\n\n*It's a bad idea, but a root login is not required.  You need a login to the other machine which has permissions to write to the folders you want to sync.  Since this is your personal stuff, you can use your normal login or create a special login on all machines specifically for Unison and grant that login permissions on those folders.\n\n*The two way binding and ease of setup mainly, but it comes down to preference.  You could try both to see which one you end up liking more.\n\n*You can perform checks before actually invoking the rsync or Unison sync.  For example, you can mount the remote machine's directory via sshfs.  If it fails, don't kick off the sync.  This can be part of your sync script.\n\n*The main bottleneck will be network speed, and Unison can be slower if you have huge amounts of data to sync (~100GB or so). Otherwise, the differences are negligible, YMMV.  Everyone's setup is different.   You should also read this post as part of your considerations.\n\n*If you're using sshfs, try the reconnect option.\nHaving said all this, if this is just for code, it's still a good idea to consider a version control system as others have said.  You can host a git server on a machine at home and synchronizing code only takes a minute or less with one command, without the overhead of maintaining mounts, logins, connections, etc. \n", "Q: Regarding installation of windows 8 alongside Ubuntu 12.04 I have purchased a laptop that came with an Ubuntu 12.04 LTS comes as an pre-installed OS.

Or is there a solution on getting it to an normal size.\nThe filesize of /proc/kcore is 140.737.486.266.368 bytes\nI have hosted my server at DigitalOcean.\n\nA: Nothing in /proc is \"real\", it's a virtual filesystem that allows you to see inside the kernel. When you read or write from any of these files you're talking directly with the kernel, not actually creating files on disk. From man proc:\n\n/proc/kcore\nThis file represents the  physical  memory  of  the  system  and  is  stored  in  the  ELF  core  file  format.   With  this  pseudo-file,  and  an  unstripped  kernel\n  (/usr/src/linux/vmlinux) binary, GDB can be used to examine the current state of any kernel data structures.\nThe total length of the file is the size of physical memory (RAM) plus 4KB.\n\nI'm not sure how true the last line is; on my laptop /proc/kcore shows up as 128TB! It's more likely the size of the address space used by the kernel or something.\nRegardless, if you need more disk space you need to look at the real filesystems. Take a look at the output of df -h to see where your space is running low. You can also then use the du command to see in more detail where space is really being used.\nInterestingly, if you run du -h /proc/kcore you'll see it says 0. :)\n", "Q: Restore SSH Key from txt I had saved my private and public SSH key contents to a text file, and I recently had to reinstall Ubuntu meaning I lost most of the stuff that was in my home folder.

The fact that you can't provide a correct password tells us that at least one half may be corrupt.  Please post the output of your ssh attempt with the \"ssh -vv\" flag added.  The debug info may reveal more details about the problem.\nNote that the .pub (public half) is one very long line.  If you stuck line breaks in there, it's no longer a valid key part.\nAlso, when you're recreating these files, make sure they have proper permissions:\nchmod 700 ~/.ssh; chmod 600 ~/.ssh/*\n\nIf you're not sure about the state/sanity of your .pub key part, you can regenerate it from the private half:\nssh-keygen -y ~/.ssh/id_rsa | tee ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\nIf you do this, note that you may have to manually append a comment to the public half, as that part is destroyed when regenerating the public key.\nnano ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\nGo to the end of the line, then add a single space followed by username@hostname.  WITHOUT pressing Enter, save the file.  Make sure no additional carriage returns/linefeeds are added to the .pub file, or it'll be broken (again).\nAssuming you've done all this and your id_rsa.pub still doesn't match up with whatever you have in the remote system's authorized_keys file, you're pretty much stuck.  You'll either have to find another backup of your id_rsa private key, or it's time to run ssh-keygen anew and start over with a new key pair.

Called up a second time by clicking the image (when it was the last tool used) made it show up immediately. But even when called up a second time via the menus, the slowness persisted. Recently, it reached the threshold of being unbearable, taking more than 10s to show up.\nI'm not aware of any configuration changes or software installs which could have caused this as a side-effect, so I'm clueless of what the culprit might be.\n\nA: As it might be useful for comparable problems, I'll include all the steps leading me to the cause. Those only interested in the solution itself: please do as you do with crime stories, skip below to the conclusion :)\nTL;DR\nTo rule out any possible software updates or installs being the root of evil, I decided to \"factory-reset\" my \"personal Gimp\" by moving away1 its config folder2 after having closed the application3:\nmv ~/.gimp-2.6 ~/.gimp-2.6-bak\n\nRestarting Gimp, it re-created a fresh config directory – and indeed, my issue was gone: the levels editor started up promptly.\nAs I didn't want to lose all my personalisations, I decided to rescue those which would not break it again, and thus walked though my backup (~/gimp-2.6-bak after above \"move\" statement):\n\n*\n\n*most sub-directories where empty, as I never installed any additional brushes/, curves/, etc. Those I could simply ignore.\n\n*the scripts/ folder contained my additional \"plug-ins\", which I definitly wanted back. So after closing Gimp again, I copied this folder back to ~/.gimp-2.6. Starting the application again showed no side-effects: the levels editor still came up promptly.\n\n*other files are either managed (and thus re-created) by Gimp itself and could be skipped as well, like controllerrc (simply open the files in a viewer, they are all plain-text. In their headers they will tell you such, e.g. \"This file will be entirely rewritten each time you exit.\" for the mentioned controllerrc file)\n\n*again other files contained nothing but comments, or where already re-created by Gimp holding the same contents as before – more candidates to skip.\n\nFinally, I found the culprit:\nSolution\nIn ~/.gimp-2.6/tool-options/gimp-levels-tool.settings Gimp does not store general settings for the levels tool, as the name would suggest. It rather contains a history of all levels the user ever has set! In my case, those dated back to June 2012 (most likely when I first used Gimp 2.6). You can see those entries when opening the drop-down box on top of the levels editor:\n\nGimp \"Levels\" editor (click image for larger variant, if needed)\nSo on each initial start of the levels editor, Gimp had to populate that drop-down – in my case with more than 2,200 entries; which explains what took that long. So the \"quick solution\" in my case would have been to simply remove that file (or to delete those entries from it which where no longer needed).\n\nFootnotes\n1 Don't delete it, it will prove useful later in any way!\n2 ~/.gimp-2.6 is where Gimp 2.6 stores all personalisations, including configs and additional scripts/brushes etc. When using a different version of Gimp, replace this with the name of yours – e.g. ~/.gimp-2.4 for Gimp 2.4, etc.\n3 It's important to close Gimp first, or it will write back parts of it on its next shutdown\n", "Q: Dell laptop USB 3.0 external hard drive boot My Dell laptop has both USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports. I have installed Ubuntu 12.04 on a USB 3.0 external hard drive. It can boot from the USB 2.0 port, but not from the USB 3.0 port. It seems to me the BIOS won't recognize USB 3.0 drives in the boot menu. I've done some research about GRUB, but it doesn't seem to address the USB 3.0 issue. Is there any other way that I can boot from the USB 3.0 port?\nI found a discussion related to the same issue. It seems like it's a hardware issue. In such case, is there any other workaround?\nIf it is impossible, and that I have to boot entirely from the USB 2.0 port, what are some ways to speed up Ubuntu?  Is it possible to use two drives, and put the home folder and maybe some programs on the drive connected to the USB 3.0 port?\n\nA: If you can't even see the drive when plugged in USB3 (in bios), then the bios simply can't trigger a boot from that port. \nYou can try two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Set up a grub on your hard drive, and boot to it. Hopefully, GRUB can now read drives in usb3. However, last time I tried, GRUB wouldn't detect my usb keyboard when plugged in USb3, so I would expect the same for using an external hard drive.\n\n*Find if there is a bios update for your motherboard.

I changed my Ubuntu One password through the \"edit personal details online\" button.\nBoth my Windows and Ubuntu One installations continue to work without updating the login information. \nI changed my password because I was worried someone else was using my account. But if their installations login info was also updated automatically it defeats the purpose of changing the password at all.\n\nA: Ubuntu One is using something called OAuth.  It will have requested your authorization on the Ubuntu site the first time you set it up, but it did this in order to get tokens.  When Ubuntu One communicates with the servers, it uses these tokens to authenticate and authorize.  Whenever the app tries to perform an operation, it will use that token, and the Ubuntu One servers will know that the token represents you.  In other words, Ubuntu One is storing your 'consent', rather than your credentials.\nThis is a common method used in several applications, and it means a few things\n\n\n*\n\n*The app doesn't store your username and password, so you don't have to worry about security leaks\n\n*You can revoke the token to stop the app from continuing to work.  You can check your tokens by following these instructions. You can also revoke your tokens on the Ubuntu site here.  \n", "Q: Symlink /var/www directory I have been trying to create a symlink:\n\n/var/www -> /home/USER/code/\n\nFollowing https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9104337/create-a-symbolic-link-of-directory-in-ubuntu , I entered the following command:\n\nsudo ln -s /var/www /home/USER/code\n\nHowever the result isn't what I expect.

Then, and only then, will a symlink called www be created that points to your localhost/code/project folder. \n", "Q: Bash built-ins with no manual entries Why do some bash built-ins (such as dirs, pushd or help) don't have manual entries?\n\nA: They have. It is man bash or man builtins. Bash is the software so it has the manual where its commands are explained. We shouldn't have a manual for every command we can give in a software. E.g ftp has some same commands like bash(e.g cd ) or same command like a binary (ls), that would be very bad to make a manual for all of these. And I didn't talked about other shell's builtins.\n\nA: There is \nman bash-builtins\n\nthey are also documented in\nman bash\n\nThe reason they don't have manpages like man help is likely because of possible confusion with other shell's builtins or a command by the same name.\nI generally find this to be adequate.

To quote this:\n\nSetting up /home on a separate partition is beneficial because your\n  settings, files, and desktop will be maintained if you upgrade,\n  (re)install Ubuntu or another distro. This works because /home has a\n  subdirectory for each user's settings and files which contain all the\n  data & settings of that user.

I am trying to install cling in Ubuntu 12.04. I thought that the proper way was to download the binaries, as they are available here, but the extracted folder looks like this:\n~/Desktop/cling » ls      \nbin  docs  include  lib  share\n\nThis requires, I think, to merge the directories content with some directories of my filesystem. I am not familiar with this method but it seems to me a bit dirty; how can I install it, upgrade it, delete it?\nI was thinking about packaging it with a deb, but I never did one so I do not know if it is the correct way..\nIs there a better way to install cling?\n\nA: Ok, this is not a weekend project and apparently it needs too many stuff to be installed before operative. So, I haven't tested this myself, but is what the instructions says (+ some bits of Ubuntu):\nGet the tools first, you need some other may be installed on your system, so to prevent this just:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential zlib-bin zlib1g-dev subversion texinfo git\n\nNow, create a directory empty to do your experiment:\nmkdir ~/cling-clang\ncd ~/cling-clang\n\nThis step will take a while if you have slow connection (please use one line at time):\nsvn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk llvm\ncd llvm/tools\nsvn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/cfe/trunk clang\ngit clone http://root.cern.ch/git/cling.git\ncd ..\ncat tools/cling/patches/*.diff | patch -p0\ncd ../llvm/projects\nsvn co http://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/compiler-rt/trunk compiler-rt\ncd ../..\nmkdir build\ncd build\n\nNow start the fun. If nothing of the above failed you can continue:\n../llvm/configure --enable-targets=host\nmake\n\nThis will build LLVM, Clang and Cling. There should be a package maintainer that do this stuff for Debian/Ubuntu, I tip my hat off. This will have the Cling built, but not installed. You may want to use checkinstall instead of sudo make install.\n\nA: Cling now provides binary snapshots for Ubuntu (as well as Fedora and OSX) which you can find here https://root.cern.ch/download/cling\nFor example if you are on ubuntu 16 (or newer?):\nsudo apt install -y wget unar\nwget https://root.cern/download/cling/cling_2020-11-05_ROOT-ubuntu2004.tar.bz2\nunar cling_2020-11-05_ROOT-ubuntu2004.tar.bz2\n./cling_2020-11-05_ROOT-ubuntu2004/bin/cling\n\n\nA: cling is now packaged for GNU Guix and Guix can be installed on top of any GNU/Linux distribution such as Ubuntu.\nAfter you've gone through the binary installation of Guix as documented here: https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Binary-Installation.html, you can install cling via:\n$ guix install cling\n\nAnd verify that it works with:\n$ cling '#include <stdio.h>' 'printf(\"Hello World!\\n\");'\nHello World!\n\nHopefully that should save you some time compared to building Cling/LLVM from source.\n", "Q: How to change boot image How do i change the image that appears during boot back to the ubuntu default?

The problem in my case was that grub was not being installed properly.\nI managed to fix it by using ubuntu boot repair https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\nrun ubuntu boot repair from within the live CD and choose recommended repair. And that should fix your troubles. But every system is different and they all work differently.\nFurther more, if you are installing only Ubuntu on this system. Then I think it would be better to install in UEFI mode (change bios from Legacy mode to UEFI or something similar) rather than MBR. As that is alot more easier.\nI installed ubuntu today again in UEFI mode and I chose something else when the installer prompted to erase disk or install ubuntu next to other OS. I created the following drives.\nefi     200mb       Efi drive\nswap    16000mb     Swap disk\next4    733000mb    root folder where ubuntu is installed \"/\"\n\nafter that everything has been working properly.\n", "Q: Boot is running fairly slow I have completely reformatted my HD and made various partitions.  My BIOS is in Legacy mode so I created a partition for Ubuntu to boot (sda1).  A pop up message appeared when I went to save that asked me to create an EFI partition for Ubuntu to boot.  I did and now it is taking quite a while to load.  I ran boot repair.  Should I delete the EFI partition?\nhttp://paste.ubuntu.com/6764562\nAlso, I set my boot to \"Ubuntu\" in my bios.\n\nA: You are not booting in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode. You have no BIOS-mode boot loader installed in the disk's MBR, but you do have EFI-mode boot loaders in the EFI System Partition (ESP; /dev/sda3 on your computer). The fact that your firmware is set to enable BIOS/CSM/legacy mode is irrelevant; on most computers, that option just opens the door for such boots, but doesn't force the computer to boot in that way.\nDo not delete the ESP. Your boot loaders reside there, so deleting that partition will render the computer unbootable!\nYour description is unclear about what's causing the sluggish boot. Elaboration on this point is required. For instance, does it take a long time for GRUB to appear, or does the system pause for a long time after GRUB appears? It might be helpful to use GRUB to edit the boot options so as to remove the quiet splash kernel options. This should result in a more verbose boot, which may provide a clue about what's causing the slowdown -- you might see errors or be able to notice a message that precedes or immediately follows an inordinate pause. Alternatively, type dmesg > foo.txt and then upload the contents of foo.txt to a pastebin site and post the resulting URL here.\n", "Q: Kazam is not recording audio from Logitech USB headset I am trying to record a short screencast using Kazam.

After the Failed Installation of a Video Card/Driver Ubuntu 13.04 Displayed a Blank (Black) Screen. There are a variety or reasons for a blank screen, each of which has a different solution.\nI see that you have Jockey. For me, Jockey was critical in resolving my blank screen as I was able to use it to assign the Nvidia driver. Under Ubuntu's system settings, for my computer, no proprietary drivers are displayed even-though they are shown as available under Jockey. Furthermore, in my case, the initial re-boot after using Jockey to set the Nvidia driver failed. Taking a leap of faith, I simply re-booted and the screen display worked as expected.\nAs an additional thought, I suspect (but I have no proof) that the blank screen may result from an Nvidia program associated with (hypothetical) driver XXXX, but is incompatible with driver ZZZZ and was not removed with the purge option for driver XXXX.

Tracing more config files, lead me to some error log that said some unicorn/pid/ directory was unwritable. A little CHOWN action later, all is well.\nThanks Ben!\n\nA: When unicorn — or any Rack-compliant server process — runs, it needs a rackup (.ru) file to tell it what to do. If you don't point it at one, it doesn't know what to serve up. I'd say the script at /etc/init.d/unicorn doesn't contain the full path to your project's rackup file, and it needs it. Most if not all Rails apps have one included nowadays as part of the Rails project generator (config.ru).\nThat guide you're following instructs you to place your code inside of /home/rails, yet places it's configuration file elsewhere (/home/unicorn/unicorn.conf). In most setups I've seen, the contents of that file usually reside in the root of the Rails directory it serves, but no biggie.\nThe guide has a bunch of configuration in a separate file at /etc/default/unicorn, which I'm guessing may be where the culprit lies. Can you post the source of that file?\n", "Q: new user compiling? so this is my first time trying to compile a source code... I downloaded subversion (no problems), added the svn repositry (with no directory(facepalm)) using code\nsvn checkout http://svn.gib.me/public/borderlands2/trunk/ \n\nand it seems to have worked (no error messages files all look good) but i don't know what to do next... i read all the compiling threads i say on here and they all say read the read me and then try it out... if someone could look at it and explain it to me i would apriciate it... i don't like asking for help or failing and its looking like both right now...\nsorry don't know if i should of added it in the first place but the program i want is gibbed borderlands 2 save editor... i can't tell if theres more then one program there or not... also i know the program was made for windows but i belive thats what source codes are for is to use them on opensource software...(hopefully)\n\nA: This particular software appears to be written for Windows.  The readme.txt file says:\n\nSaveEdit requires the full .NET Framework 4, which can be downloaded\n  from   http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17851\nMost UI interface icons are courtesy of Fugue Icons available at\nhttp://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/\n\nIt may be possible to build and run the software with Mono which you can run on Ubuntu, the above says it needs .NET Framework 4 and the Mono compatibility list seems to imply this should work.\nHowever, the build system that's included in the file is a solution file for Visual Studio 2010 (that's what the Borderlands 2.sln file is in your checkout).  \nI don't know of any way to build a solution file without Visual Studio itself, so I think you'd have to figure out how to build it yourself.\nUnless you're in for a lot of work I'd suggest building this on Windows with a copy of Visual Studio Express (free).\n", "Q: problem with btrfs tools I've installed btrf-tools and I would like to shrink 5gb off my primary partition for use as a temporary snapshot for a dd backup.

If you run as root and don't have any btrfs then you get the output you got. If you do have a btrfs and btrfs fi show can't find it, there might be something wrong.\nbtrfs fi df simply needs to be run on the mountpoint, not the block device.\n", "Q: Sha1sum Mismatch! Clarification I just started using Ubuntu, and I'm trying to get Wine up and running. By using Winetricks I'm trying to install some software and I keep getting this error message:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/l65jhSa.png\nIt says \n\n\"Sha1sum Mismatch! Rename\n  /home/jaken/.cache/winetricks/flash/install_flash_player_10_active_x_.exe\n  and try again\"\n\nI don't know what it wants me to rename. I'm confused by this error screen. Could anyone shed some light on an Ubuntu noob?\n\nA: Alternatively you could install flash player from the terminal (press Ctrl + Alt + T) and type in the following:\nsudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer \n\n\nA: If you just want to use Flash, then as hash has said you don't need to install the Windows version, just install the flashplugin-installer package. However, if you're trying to run Windows programs that themselves embed flash (but don't install it themselves), then you might actually need to install Flash in Wine. This is uncommon.\nIf that is your situation, then you'll want to do what the error message says and rename that file. The file is exactly where Winetricks says it is, but you may be confused since files and folders whose names start with . are hidden by default.\nYou can rename the file by running these commands:\ncd ~/.cache/winetricks/flash\nmv install_flash_player_10_active_x_.exe install_flash_player_10_active_x_.exe.bak\n\nThere, the second filename after mv is the new name for the file. I've added a .bak suffix to the file. The ~ is shorthand--recognized by the shell--that stands for the full name of your home folder (/home/jaken).\nOr if you prefer to do the renaming through a graphical interface:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a folder window for your home folder. (This is Ubuntu's graphical file browser, Nautilus.)\n\n*Press Ctrl+H or click View > Show Hidden Files.\n\n*Go into the cache subfolder.\n\n*Go into the winetricks subfolder.\n\n*Go into the flash subfolder.\n\n*Find the entry for install_flash_player_10_active_x_.exe and rename it.\n\n\nAfter you rename the file, you can run the Winetricks command again. It won't find the file at its usual name and location, so it will download it again. If the problem was really that the download was corrupted during download, this should fix it.\nOn the other hand, if the file is bad on the download server, or (more likely) if the file on the server has the same name but has been modified by Adobe since its hash was taken by the Winetricks maintainers, then you may get this error again.\nIf the error happens again, there may be other avenues of troubleshooting. Or you can pretend you're using Windows, download the Windows installer for Adobe Flash (you have to get the Internet Explorer / ActiveX version to have the same functionality as that file is giving you) and install it with Wine, bypassing Winetricks. (When possible it's preferable to have Wintricks automate such installations, of course.)\n\nA: The problem is downloading failed, so you can download the file needed by yourself. After selecting the software or component in the Winetricks, there are logs in the terminal as follows:\nYou are using a 64-bit WINEPREFIX.

I have recently installed Ubuntu 13.10 on my computer, and it says Dayz can't be played on my platform. I am a Ubuntu beginner. Is there anything I can do to get it to play in Ubuntu?\n\nA: DayZ doesn't run natively on Linux, only on Windows.\nThere is a way to run Windows applications on Linux, using Wine.  You can think of Wine like a Windows emulator, which it fundamentally isn't (Wine Is Not an Emulator).  To install Wine, install it through the Software Center or open a terminal and type sudo apt-get install wine.\nTo find out how well an application runs in Wine, check out WineHQ.  The entry for DayZ is here, and it appears that it's playable, but with some serious issues.  Of course, you'll have to install Steam for Windows through Wine, which is well documented here.\nYou may have better luck installing a more modern Wine version than Ubuntu ships with, which you can acquire by the instructions here.\nThe way I see it, you have three options:\n\n\n*\n\n*Dual-boot with Windows and play DayZ on there\n\n*Try and get it running in Wine and work around the issues\n\n*Have another Windows computer in your house and use Steam In-Home Streaming\n\n\nMore info on the latter here.

If someone has a better different way to do this, that would be much appreciated as well.\nI am installing Ubuntu 13.10 onto a Macbook pro 9.2 I have done this twice before, with the caveat being that, when I did this before, I just set up a dual boot. Now, I am trying to setup Ubuntu exclusively, and also trying to encrypt my hard drive. I tried installing Mac OS first, and then setting up a second partition, and creating a refit partition, and then deleting the first partition, but the Ubuntu installer won't let me encrypt my hard drive if I do it that way.\nI can get through the installation process just fine, but when it comes time to reboot, I run into the blank white screen followed by a flashing folder with a question mark on it. Looking into it, I believe what I need, is an EFI that I can set up from my newly created Ubuntu partition. So my question is this, is there an EFI that I can set up from Ubuntu, that will be recognized by a Macbook hardware, and run on startup?\nNote: I was able to get back in to Ubuntu, by rebooting, and \"trying Ubuntu\" from my flash drive, and then logging in to my encrypted hard drive, but I no longer have Mac OS installed on my computer, so solutions that involve having mac os installed, while not impossible, are not easy.\n\nA: EFI is a type of firmware. I believe that what you mean when you write \"EFI\" is EFI System Partition (ESP), which is where EFI boot loaders reside on most EFI-based computers. Macs, although they're (sort of) EFI-based, are weird; Apple's EFI implementation looks first to the Mac's HFS+ root (/) partition for a boot loader.\nGenerally speaking, the best way to install Linux in a single-boot configuration is to go with a straight-MBR setup and a BIOS-mode boot loader such as GRUB, without using the GUID Partition Table (GPT) or an EFI-mode boot loader or boot manager such as rEFIt or rEFInd. Thus, I recommend you wipe your partition table by using GParted or parted to create a new one. (Both GParted and parted refer to an MBR partition table as an \"msdos\" partition table.) When you boot the Ubuntu installer in BIOS/CSM/legacy mode, it should then install using MBR partitions and the computer will boot just like a commodity PC.\nAlthough it is possible to install Linux in EFI mode on a Linux-only Mac, doing so is tricky because of Apple's weird EFI, which requires an OS X tool called bless to manage. Although there is a Linux port of bless, it's rather exotic, and AFAIK it doesn't ship with Ubuntu, so you'll have to track it down and learn to use it in order to manage a Linux-only EFI-mode boot. (Alternatively, you could manage the boot process using an OS X CD-R or USB flash drive, but that's a bit awkward.)\n\nA: I've had the exact same problem as the submitter. Completely wipes out the hard drive, installs Ubuntu with GRUB, reboots with a single flashing folder. I'm upset that Apple can get away with this behavior, after all, their PC is just that… another PC that's been locked down with ESP, a form of draconian DRM. Here, I choose Ubuntu, but am not allowed to use it because Apple doesn't want me to.\nUnfortunately, the solutions recommended above didn't work for me on a Mac Pro 4,1. I'm still getting the flashing folder of DRM.\n", "Q: 'Low Disk Space' warning received when disk is nowhere near full I noticed this warning because it stops one of my applications (BOINC) from being able to work on a number of BOINC projects.\nThe 'Low Disk Space' warning says that I have 1.1GB remaining.

Properly I have installed and configured python from online tutorials, python books, and other various sources in the past only to find myself digging through forums when things go wrong and piecing various information together to try and reach my objective. Which is a clean installation/configuration of python 3.X.X that does not interfere with the system's default interpreter, has pip, easy install, distribute tools, and virtualenv all properly configured and working; can be used side-by-side with the system's python interpreter, is installed in the /opt/ directory (the proper location), is named clearly in the  /opt/ directory (e.g. python3.3.0, python3.3.1, python3.3.2), and can be called from the terminal window without using alias (i.e. the path is setup and working). This is a lot of criteria, but is the setup I'm looking for. When following online tutorials, I can typically achieve a few of these, but never all of them. \nThe closest tutorial I have found so far is here (How do I install Python 3.3?), but it still doesn't provide enough clarification or has broken steps. For example, the answer with the most votes (by Sergey and minerz029) has the following issues:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does not explain how to setup pip, easy install, distribute tools,\nand virtualenv. It appears impossible with those steps because they\ndo not include setting up the proper dependencies before compiling to\nget distribute tools (necessary to get pip) prior to compiling (as\nindicated here\n(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18833442/installing-distribute-for-python-3-3).\nBut then when trying to follow the second link, openssl-devel doesnt\nseem available from apt-get.\n\n*Does not setup the python path but rather uses a systemlink.\nAll the tutorials I follow start a chain reaction in going from forum to forum with no clear answer because everyone uses different steps, commands, methodologies etc. and often leave out key points that start the hunt all over again. Can anyone take a look at the first link and explain how to get pip, easy_install working? I have also followed the second author's instructions (i.e. “Boolean”) but his steps break at step 3 and appears to exclude key points between steps 2 and 3 in switching directories. \n\nA: These steps will create a Python 3.3 virtualenv in a /opt subdirectory:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Pip and virtualenv on your system Python installation.\nsudo apt-get install python-pip\nsudo -H pip install virtualenv\n\n\n*Run this command (see notes below):\nsudo -H virtualenv /opt/python_custom -p python3\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Replace /opt/python_custom with the path you would like to install to.\n\n*Replace python3 with the interpreter which will be used, e.g.: python2, python3.3 or others.\n\n\n*If you want to operate on this Python installation, you will need to run this command first:\nsource /opt/<PYTHON>/bin/activate\n\n(replace <PYTHON> with the path from above)\nYour shell prompt will change to reflect the current virtualenv.\n\n*You can then use sudo pip to install whichever packages you would like, e.g.:\nsudo pip install setuptools\nsudo pip install distribute\n\nNote: To use this Python in your scripts, specify the #! line to be the virtualenv interpreter, e.g.:\n#!/opt/python_custom/bin/python\n\nNote: You'll need to use sudo when changing the virtualenv (e.g.: by installing a package with pip) because it is installed into /opt, which is owned by root.\n", "Q: What editors are available for writing CoffeeScript? I'm looking for a good editor for CoffeeScript. What I want is syntax highlighting and auto indentation when a new line is entered, like IDLE for Python. \nI've already tried the gedit-coffeescript plugin, but it does only syntax highlighting not the indentation formatting.

I don't have this problem on my main user account or new user account that I just created. \nI also installed and tested other consols but they had the same problem. \nWhat could be wrong and how can I fix it? \n\nA: This problem can occur when some of shell initialization files (like .bashrc, .profile, .bash_logout) which are hidden files are missing, empty or corrupted.

I am using the Tor Browser Bundle in Ubuntu from a client machine on a restricted network. In part, I do this because it appears that TBB's native encryption allows me to bypass certain network filters which cannot inspect my data packets.\nHowever, how safe is it to transfer sensitive information (data that I publish, sites I visit, pages I read, etc.) from within a restricted network over the Tor Browser Bundle?\n\nA: Tor should protect you from your local network, if that's what you're worried about.\nThe problem with Tor is the exit node (whose traffic could be sniffed) but that's hard to predict or manipulate (unless you're the NSA). If you're using SSL over Tor, that's even better.\nPersonally, I'd opt to just SSH to a server of mine and use its OpenSSH's built in SOCKS proxy.\nssh -D 9090 user@server\n\nThen you can set your browser's proxy (remember it has to be a SOCKS proxy, not HTTP - that won't work) to localhost:9090 and boom, your traffic is fully encrypted all the way out to the server.\n\n\n*\n\n*Pro: To your local network it'll also look like standard encrypted SSH traffic. Much less suspicious than Tor traffic.\n\n*Pro: It should be faster. There's less of the deliberate snaking that Tor encourages and server bandwidth is usually pretty great. This should keep things buzzing along.\n\n*Meh: The endpoint (where you server sits) is still vulnerable but if it's yours, you should know the network more than you'll know the network of a Tor node.\n\n*Con: It's not anonymous. Your server? Your IP. Not yours? Keeps a log of you connecting.\n\n\nA: I will say that Tor is not as safe as you may think. And I argue this statement with the following quote from this article: Is Tor's Anonymous Internet Still Secure?\n\nBrowsing the Web with The Onion Router, or Tor, is supposed to make\n  you anonymous. Many of the encryption algorithms used by this popular\n  Internet anonymizing protocol have likely been cracked by the NSA,\n  says one security expert – and upgrading to the newest versions of Tor\n  software won’t be enough to protect your privacy.\nThere's still much we don't know about the NSA's reported ability to\n  circumvent online encryption. The Sept. 5 articles by The New York\n  Times and The Guardian are light on details, but they suggest that the\n  NSA has cracked a significant portion of the Secure Sockets Layer\n  (SSL), the encrypted protocol that oversees the connection between\n  your browser and the websites it displays.\nThat means 76 percent of Tor's supposedly anonymous network traffic\n  might be crackable by the NSA, according to the findings of security\n  expert Robert Graham, the CEO of Errata Security.\nMORE: 13 Security and Privacy Tips for the Truly Paranoid\n\nSee also: Tor is Not as Safe as You May Think.\n\nA: Tools Do Not Equal Security\nSecurity is a function of your assets you want to protect (sensitive information, life and limb), your adversaries' resources, and the tools and methods you use to adequately protect your assets from your adversaries' resources.\nFor instance, your restricted network is unspecified but may be monitoring all client machines' keystrokes (or simply yours if you are a specific target) rather than your network packets. If this is the case, the Tor Browser Bundle is not keeping your activities confidential nor protecting your anonymity with respect to those activities.\nTor is extremely secure but it is not magic\nIn comparison to any other tools you might use to separate your person and identity from otherwise non-identifying Internet browser reading and publishing, all Tor Browser Bundle traffic intercepted between your machine and the last Tor relay (exit relay) is robustly secure because, if I understand correctly, Tor encrypts this traffic using \"128-bit AES in counter mode, with an IV of all 0 bytes\" for a stream cipher and using \"RSA with 1024-bit keys and a fixed exponent of 65537\" for a public-key cipher.\n\n*\n\n*Note, however, that Tor does not \"magically encrypt all traffic throughout the Internet\" and once your sensitive traffic is decrypted by the Tor network's exit relay you are relying on extra-Tor encryption or your traffic is cleartext that any adversary can read including the exit relay operator, etc.\n\nA good place to find more information is: Tor Project FAQ\n\nMore Details\n\n\"We've already got an improved circuit extension handshake protocol that uses curve25519 in place of RSA1024, and we're using (where supported) P256 ECDHE in our TLS handshakes, but there are more uses of RSA1024 to replace, including:\n\n*\n\n*Router identity keys\n\n*TLS link keys\n\n*Hidden service keys\"\n\n\n\"Ed25519 (specifically, Ed25519-SHA-512 as described and specified at http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/).\"\n", "Q: Auto mount webdav folder I want to auto mount webdav folder with bash script.

This is because it shows you more clearly the impact of your changes, and because, for a file you're not actually creating (like sudoers in \"Way 1\"), opening the file in  a text editor shows you other contents of the file that might be relevant. You should generally understand your current configuration before making changes to it and reading any configuration file you're editing is sometimes helpful toward that end.\nHowever, more importantly, a tiny mistake in editing /etc/sudoers or any file in /etc/sudoers.d makes sudo refuse to work entirely until the probem is fixed.\nFor desktop Ubuntu systems but not most server systems, there's a relatively easy fix for this; otherwise, you might have to boot to recovery mode or from a live CD/DVD/USB to fix the problem of being locked out from being able to perform any administrative actions.\nEither way, you should use visudo to edit /etc/sudoers and any files in /etc/sudoers.d.\nFor /etc/sudoers: sudo visudo\nFor a file in /etc/sudoers.d called vagrant: sudo visudo /etc/sudoers.d/vagrant\nvisudo has you edit a temporary file and, once you've exited, checks your syntax to ensure it is correct before copying over the temporary file to the real configuration file.\nBecause of this mechanism, if you want to use terminal one-liners instead of a text editor, you should be able to use visudo in connection with sed or some mechanism similar to pipes (like tee) to edit sudoers files safely in a manner comparable to what you've used in \"Way 1\" and \"Way 2.\nPerhaps someone else will post an answer detailing how to do that; if not, then next time I have access to a machine suitable for such testing, I may try to figure it out and expand this answer with an example. Alternatively, using sed or echo safely to create/modify sudoers and sudoers.d configuration might be considered the subject of a separate question. This is especially the case if your main interest here is whether to give NOPASSWD sudo-to-root power directly or through group membership.\nConferring sudo-to-root power by group membership vs. per-user\nThe main difference between \"Way 1\" and \"Way 2\" is:\n\n*\n\n*\"Way 1\" makes the user an administrator and confers the ability to administrators to run commands as root with sudo without being prompted for a password.\n\n*\"Way 2\" confers this ability specifically on the one user.\n\nUnless you want all administrators to be able to sudo-to-root without a password (by default, entering a password is required), \"Way 2\" is preferable.\nHowever, any user who you want to be able to run arbitrary commands as root should probably also be an administrator! (This will let them use pkexec and it avoids confusion if you or an associate is trying to figure out who all the users are with the ability to perform system administration tasks.)\nTherefore, the best thing to do may well be to add vagrant as an administrator and separately confer NOPASSWD abilities to vagrant specifically (and not to administrators in general).\n", "Q: Unsecured desktop sharing Can anyone advise me of the best way to get around mongrel hackers.\nI came home to find my mouse pointer merrily moving across the screen, opening disgusting web pages and what looked like trying to run a script file.\nI immediately switched the machine off and removed the network cable however when i opened firefox it would just go to porn sites.. logged in as another user and am now running beachbit and clamAV as sudo to clean it out however my browser is still stuffed.. any IDEAS people, I need that desktop connection for my work.\nI expect I will have to re-install ubuntu?\n\nA: You might be asking the wrong question. You're thinking about what you can do to prevent future attacks, but the risks to you from this one appear from your description to be far from over.\nFrom your description, it seems your system was broken into by an actual person (not just some automated process), who did whatever they wanted to your system. They may have installed rootkits or made any other nasty, subtle changes.\nYou have to wipe your disk and reinstall. In this particular situation, it's especially impossible to predict all the changes that may have been made to your system. There's debate about whether or not this is always necessary after malware infection, but here, you really cannot predict what has happened because a real person directly controlled your computer. There's no question about it: the first thing to do is wipe your disk and reinstall from trusted media.\nIf you continue to use this system without wiping the disk and reinstalling, you put your own information security, as well as that of any other users and anyone who relies on you to keep any electronic data in confidence.\nIf you don't have fully current backups, you should of course documents first, preferably by booting from a live CD/DVD/USB (don't create it from a file on this computer) and accessing them that way.\nBefore wiping and reinstalling:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't log in to any online services from the compromised system. (Or, if you have already, then at least no more.)\n\n*Avoid using the system at all. Don't keep it running.\n\n\nAfter wiping, and during the reinstallation and afterwards:\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't use the same password. Your password shouldn't be stored on your computer in cleartext, but (1) it could have been captured by software installed by the intruder (for example, with a keylogger), and (2) your password hashes could have been dumped and might successfully be cracked, especially these days with cheap cloud computing and multi-GPU password crackers.\n\n*Change all your passwords for any online services you've accessed from this computer in the recent past (even somewhat before the attack). And if there's any chance your password for an online service was stored in your browser or elsewhere on your computer, make sure to change it even if you hadn't logged in to it for a long time before the attack. Passwords stored in web browsers are trivially easy for anyone with control over your system to access.\n\n*If you store credit card or other such data on your computer--especially if it's saved in a web browser or in a client application--or if you've accessed such personal financial information recently through your computer, you should be alert for the possibility of attempts at identity theft. In this case, you should read your credit card and bank statements carefully. Needless to say, as covered by the previous point, you should change any passwords for online banking if you've used the on this computer.\n\n", "Q: Dependencies still exist in \"dpkg -l\" after running \"apt-get remove dependencies-names\" I suspected that installing xfce4 cause some issues in Ubuntu so I removed them using apt-get remove xfce4 xfce4-goodeis.\nBut when I ran 'dpkg -l' I still can see some libraries and packages for xfce4:\n$ dpkg -l | grep -i xfce\nrc  libexo-1-0:amd64                              0.10.2-2                                 amd64        Library with extensions for Xfce\nrc  libgarcon-1-0                                 0.2.1-1                                  amd64        freedesktop.org compliant menu implementation for Xfce\nrc  libxfce4ui-1-0                                4.11.0-0ubuntu1~ppa0.13.10.1             amd64        widget library for Xfce - Gtk+2 variant\nrc  libxfce4ui-common                             4.11.0-0ubuntu1~ppa0.13.10.1             all          common files for libxfce4ui\nrc  libxfce4util6                                 4.10.1-1                                 amd64        Utility functions library for Xfce4\nrc  libxfcegui4-4                                 4.10.0-2                                 amd64        Basic GUI C functions for Xfce4\nrc  libxfconf-0-2                                 4.10.0-2                                 amd64        Client library for Xfce4 configure interface\nrc  mousepad                                      0.3.0-2                                  amd64        simple Xfce oriented text editor\nrc  thunar                                        1.6.3-1ubuntu1                           amd64        File Manager for Xfce\nrc  xfce4-appfinder                               4.10.1-1                                 amd64        Application finder for the Xfce4 Desktop Environment\nrc  xfce4-clipman                                 2:1.2.3-2ubuntu1                         amd64        clipboard history utility\nrc  xfce4-mixer                                   1:4.10.0-1ubuntu2                        amd64        Xfce mixer application\nrc  xfce4-notes                                   1.7.7-3ubuntu2                           amd64        Notes application for the Xfce4 desktop\nrc  xfce4-panel                                   4.10.1-1ubuntu1                          amd64        panel for Xfce4 desktop environment\nrc  xfce4-power-manager                           1.2.0-2ubuntu1                           amd64        power manager for Xfce desktop\nrc  xfce4-session                                 4.10.1-1ubuntu1                          amd64        Xfce4 Session Manager\nrc  xfce4-settings                                4.11.1-0ubuntu1~ppa0.13.10.1             amd64        graphical application for managing Xfce settings\nrc  xfce4-terminal                                0.6.2-3ubuntu1.1                         amd64        Xfce terminal emulator\nrc  xfce4-volumed                                 0.2.0-0ubuntu1                           amd64        volume keys daemon\nrc  xfdesktop4                                    4.11.2-0ubuntu1~ppa0.13.10.1             amd64        xfce desktop background, icons and root menu manager\nrc  xfwm4                                         4.11.1-0ubuntu1~ppa0.13.10.1             amd64        window manager of the Xfce project\n\nI copy-pasted all these packages\\libraries to form an apt-get remove command to remove all of these dependencies, and the command ran normally, but running dpkg -l | grep -i xfce showed these dependencies again !\nWhy are these dependencies still installed ?\n\nA: Note the rc at the beginning of the list.\n\nr: Remove (marked for removal) \nc: Configuration files are present.\n\nThe difference between apt-get remove and purge (From man apt-get)\n   remove\n       remove is identical to install except that packages are removed instead of installed.\n       Note the removing a package leaves its configuration files in system.\n\n   purge\n       purge is identical to remove except that packages are removed and purged (any\n       configuration files are deleted too).\n\nAs you choose to apt-get remove, your dpkg -l reflecting that. If you would have been used apt-get purge you could avoid such a situation. To get rid of these, try in terminal,\ndpkg --list | grep \"^rc\" | cut -d \" \" -f 3 | xargs sudo dpkg --purge\n\nIt will purge all the packages which are marked for removal. Before you purge them you can check the list which you are going to purge using,\ndpkg --list | grep \"^rc\" | cut -d \" \" -f 3 \n\nI guess you have no other package remain marked for removal except those are from xfce. If you are not sure about it. Use the following instead,\ndpkg --list | grep -i xfce | cut -d \" \" -f 3 | xargs sudo dpkg --purge\n\n\nA: The dependencies are not still installed.\nWhen you run dpkg -l, dpkg calls dpkg-query. Entries in the first column (where you're seeing rc) consist of two one-letter abbreviations.\nThe first letter specifies the desired state of the package as specified by package management actions. r means it is intended to be removed. This means it either\n\n\n*\n\n*is actually removed, or\n\n*has been specified for removal but is not yet fully removed or the removal failed.\n\n\nTo see which is the case, consult the second letter, c. This indicates what, from the package, is installed. If no files of any kind are present, the second letter reads n (though actually, since you're running dpkg -l/dpkg --list without arguments and then parsing the output, the entry would simply not appear at all if there were no files).\nc means all that's installed are configuration files. Usually it's not safe to assume a user wants to remove these when uninstalling a package. If you want to remove them, you can pass the --purge flag to apt-get (or specify the purge action instead of the remove action) when uninstalling packages.\nTo remove these configuration files, even though the packages themselves are uninstalled, you can still purge them, either with dpkg -P ... or apt-get purge .... Using dpkg to purge many packages is can be somewhat complicated but apt-get will match regular expressions (as grep does) for package names. Assuming you want a single short command that removes all these packages and *assuming you really want to remove all packages with xfce in their name, this will do the trick:\nsudo apt-get purge xfce.\\*\n\nNote that the * is not a wildcard, .\\* matches zero or more of any character. The . is essential for making this happen (see below). This regexp is equivalent to just xfce, but it's recognized as a regexp by apt-get because it contains the special character *.\n(Similarly, if you used xfce\\* or xfce* it would remove all packages with xfc in the name. People have tried to get rid of Wine by removing wine*, which has resulted in every package with win anywhere in the name being removed, breaking their systems!)\nOr if you prefer to do the purge with dpkg, an easily comprehended way (which I think thereby reduces mistakes) to do so is to tell dpkg-list how to format its own output:\nsudo dpkg -P `dpkg-query -f='${Package}\\n' -W | grep xfce`\n\nOr you can simply run dpkg-query -f='${Package} ' -W | grep xfce, letting you examine the output to make sure it's what you want, and then copy and paste that space-delimited list of packages into a sudo apt-get purge or sudo dpkg -P command.\n", "Q: What does the pipe | indicate in apt-cache rdepends?

After that, I installed ubuntu from a liveCD and all went apparently fine.\nThe problem is that GRUB shows up instead of refit and there's no way to boot OSX because when I choose OSX from the grub menu nothing occurs.\nI have found this topic that seems to talk about this problem but it's my first ubuntu installation on a mac computer and I don't want to mess the things up. \nUbuntu installed GRUB over rEFIt\nAnd also this is the answer given from iamwpj, that seems to be my solution but I don't know how to do it. \n\nI actually figured this out. The easiest way in any situation where\n  GRUB overwrites rEFIt is to hit C when the GRUB screen loads. This\n  will bring up the grub command line. Typing exit here will exit GRUB\n  and show you rEFIt. From here a boot into OSX will allow you to\n  uninstall GRUB and install rEFInd.\n\nShould I uninstall GRUB from ubuntu? And, after that, will refit show up?\nThanks.\n\nA: You can set up rEFInd to boot Linux directly. Chances are all you need to do is to install the EFI filesystem driver for whatever filesystem holds your kernel (probably ext4fs). You can do this in OS X by creating an /EFI/refind/drivers directory and copying the relevant driver file (such as ext4_x64.efi) from the rEFInd package to the new directory. (This assumes a default installation of rEFInd from OS X; if you used the --ownhfs or --esp option, rEFInd will be located somewhere other than /EFI/refind.) Once you've set this up, you may also want to run the mkrlconf.sh script, which comes with rEFInd, in Linux. This isn't absolutely required in most cases, although it is necessary for some configurations. The biggest change you'll see is a switch from verbose boot with text-mode boot messages to the more familiar graphical boot with an Ubuntu logo on the screen.\n", "Q: How to download ubuntu iso for dell laptop I bought dell vostro M5460(corei3 2.5GHZ).

Is there any software which is tender on RAM, and can remotely shut down my PC? I am using lubuntu 13.10\n\nA: Of course there is, but you will need an active daemon (it's like a Windows service) in your controllable machine.\nIt can require time, i'm writing to you a brief explanation:\n\n\n*\n\n*A discrete solution for experienced users is the Knockd daemon, which can be used to elaborate the probes sent to your computer. You should associate the shutdown -hP now command in the config file (command = shutdown -hP now OR command = /usr/bin/shutdown -hP now).\nBe aware that this can also allow an attacker to shutdown/attack your machine if you don't change the default knocks in the config file. Read the manual on the website before installing this software. You can install it by writing in a terminal (xterm is OK) apt-get install knockd or with your packed manager (search knockd or 'knockd daemon').\n\n*An more obvious solution is to use an ssh server software.\nThis is a secure, well tested and common solution; you'll find hundred of guides about openssh-server. \nIf it isn't already installed, on a terminal (xterm is OK) execute: sudo apt-get install openssh-server.\nIf the installation fails, check your connection or use Synaptics (or your preferred packet manager) to find a different ssh server in the repository.\nAfter the installation, reboot and execute in the term pa -A|grep ss to know if ssh is active, if not let us know and we'll solve.\nIn the remote computer (the client) install PuTTY (suggested for Windows/NT users) or one of those ssh client and obtain the IP of the controllable computer (the active server) by visiting a specialized website from it (you can use the no-IP service with the apposite software to obtain a dynamic domain; you can use it like an IP, but you'll need to keep it updated).\nAfter this procedure connect with your client software and issue the shutdown command. If it doesn't shutdown let us know and we'll solve.\nBe aware that you must keep the ssh server updated (always do the distro security updates!) and well protected with a password/certificate.\n\n*If you can't use one of the above methods and you want an easy solution, use the common RealVNC or an equivalent proprietary software. Please note that there are also many easy-to-use but less common open source software for remote controlling a PC.\nThose software will consume more resources, more bandwidth and have more security vulnerabilities than the softwares suggested in the first two points, because are remote controlling software.\nRemember: there is no pre-installed/pre-configured remote control software to do what you ask to do, because any control software can weak the system security if not used properly.\nI hope I'm usefull, but this is not the place to insert a full guide.\nIf you need help with one of the methods comment down here and you'll be helped.\nHave a nice experience.\n", "Q: Radiance theme customization in Ubuntu: edit Window decorator and all!

So then, I chose graphic safe mode -> reconfigure graphics (default), and then, low graphics boot for one session, and then update grub bootloader. At last, I clicked on standard boot, and I reached for the first time the ubuntu desktop.

I give my way to other people who could have the same problem. Actually, I removed Linux and then restored the windows boot (which both didn't boot normally).\nI first deleted the Linux partitions as follows (so save files before if needed) \n(do it if linux was installed on its own partition -> if installed with Wubi, go to control panel-> programs-> uninstall program-> select Ubuntu-> uninstall) :\n\n\n*\n\n*go to disk management by pressing WinKey + X or write diskmgmt.msc, in the search menu then choose diskmgmt \n\n*right click on the linux partitions, and delete them (the linux partitions can be recognized by right cliking on them, select property, and seeing that they have no label for file system, as they are detected as unknown partitions). Be careful to not delete other partitions.\n\n*Extend the C: partition with the obtained free space (right click-> extend volume) or format the free space if you want to reuse it later.\nHere, Linux was deleted from my computer,but not its bootloader.\nThus, if I restarted at this point, I would have the following error : no such device: *a number* grub rescue>\nSo I repaired the windows boot, by rebooting my computer using a bootable USB windows recovery drive. Create a USB recovery drive.\nHere, check the partition table type : MBR or GPT as follows : \nin disk management (see before), right click on the left \"box\" on the left of your partitions (Disk 0), select properties, go to Volumes, and see Partition style\nBoot on the USB drive, choose a keyboard, choose advanced options, and then the command line.\nWhen in the command line, \n\n\n*\n\n*if MBR, there is a command : bootrec.exe /fixmbr, but need to look on internet for more details. Don't use this command if in GPT I think it could damage something.\n\n*if GPT (like me), follow these links : Repair Windows 8 EFI Bootloader or the first (most useful) answer of How can I repair the Windows 8 EFI Bootloader?\nFor me (GPT solution), it worked perfectly (the windows recovery options changed a little, that's all)\nGood luck !\n", "Q: Use input from a file for a command I want to use the mac address stored in a file in aireplay-ng command.

It could be that subtle movements of the mouse might trigger wake-up.\nOn a side-note: can you post the results of lspci from the terminal. It might show what devices have the possibility of 'waking-up' the laptop when you connect the pci codes from both outputs.\nedit: I see that most of the things that enable your computer to wake-up are usb connected. You could try to disable these, if you don't use usb connected software to wake from suspend anyway.\nYou can use the sudo sh -c \"echo **** > /proc/acpi/wakeup\" command to disable (or enable) things in the wakeup file. The **** should be replaced with the device you wish to enable/disable (for instance EHC2 or KBD0) from the wakeup file.\nLet me know if this works or not, so i can look for other solutions.\n", "Q: Adding a xkill icon in gnome-shell's dock First of all, sorry for my English.\nI'm trying to add an icon in the gnome-shell's dock (with Ubuntu 13.04 and 13.10) for the command line app xkill, but it doesn't work, since it is a terminal application. But if I create the menu entry as a \"terminal application\" (writting it in a .desktop file or throghout the \"Main Menu\" application), it opens, consequently, a terminal with the message: \"Select the window bla bla bla....\".\nWhat I really want is a more natural and direct way for closing a blocked window by force, and not by means of a terminal.\nFor older versions of gnome-shell there was a little extension which made it (adding a little icon in the top bar), but it exists no longer (or I haven't found it).\nSolution? Thanks.\n\nA: Create a launcher with the command gnome-desktop-item-edit --create-new ~/Desktop as suggested by @maythux, but just add /usr/bin/xkill as the command.\n(Do NOT use gnome-terminal -e).\nThis creates the launcher on the desktop.\nSimply drag it to the dock and remove it from the desktop if you like.\n\n\nA: I use Easystroke Gesture Recognition for that purpose. Install it then pick up Gesture Button >button 3 from preferences tab, it lets you run commands dragging right button and drawing a figure like line, circle or whatever you like then switch to Action tab and record a guesture dragging right button, finally add commad \nsudo xkill\nthat's all.\nWhenever you want to kill a frozen window, just drag right button and draw the shape you attained, you will get a x shape cursor to kill the window.\n\nA: You can do this trick to get your need(it still use the terminal but you have not to take care about.)\nFirst create a launcher on desktop by using the old GUI dialog. \nUsing ALT+F2 type:\ngnome-desktop-item-edit --create-new ~/Desktop \nThis will start the dialog( Create launcher):\n\nIn the Name field put any name you like.\nIn the command field put the command gnome-terminal -e \"xkill\" or if you have other terminal emulators you can use like xterm or whatever.\nNow drag and drop the created launcher to the Unity launcher and try it :). \n\nAnother Solution:\nHere is a scipt to do what you like and they have a unity launcher and you can learn how to install and use\n", "Q: Usb keyboard and mouse recognized but not working in Ubuntu 12.04 For a while now my usb keyboard and mouse have stopped working in ubuntu 12.04 after some update.

I've installed it, but it does not show up when I click on it.\n\n*EncFS tutorials are confusing.\n\n\nIs there any other GUI tool or easy tutorial for EncFS?\n\nA: First Method:\nYou can use ecryptfs-utils\nsudo apt-get install ecryptfs-utils\nAfter installing, run the commands below to create your encrypted private folder.\necryptfs-setup-private\nYou’ll be prompted to create a ‘Mount Passphrase’. The first prompt is for your login password. The one you use to login, type that to continue. Next you’ll be prompted to create a Mount Passphrase. This is the one you’ll use to recover your data at a later date.\n\nAnother method: Compressing Trick method\nYou don't have to use any third-party software, we will just use the archive manager to compress the file or folder and lock it with a password so that you disallow unauthorized users from copying your contents.\nRight click on the file(s) or folder(s) and select Compress:\n\nIn the window that will appear, select a compression format (7z, zip, tar, etc.), then click Other Options:\n\nEnter any password of your choice, check on \"Encrypt the file list too\", then click Create:\n\nYou have now compressed and password-protected your file/folder.

I am scared its some indexer or some other background process.\n\nA: If the disk space is always freed after reboot that most likely means that the space is used up by some unlinked files. Unlinked files are deleted = unlinked from the file system, but a process still keeps them open, so the disk space used up by such a file is not freed until the process releases the file. The process holding the unlinked file may also keep writing to the file and using up more and more disk space undetectable in the file system.\nTo view unlinked files and the process which holds them you can use lsof. Until a long time I always used some grep-ing on the lsof output to view the unlinked files, but a while ago I found this super answer on how to view unlinked files easily. You just have to use\nlsof +L1\n\nas this will list all open files which have link count less than 1, hence they are unlinked.\nSo use lsof +L1 and check if there are a lot of files or big files unlinked on your machine, you will also see which process holds them. \n\nA: If you are in a situation where reboot isn't always freeing the spacing, I would reboot into rescue mode and use du as described above to get a feel for where the space is going. I tend to do \"du -sc * | sort -n\" as a quick-and-dirty way of doing this sort of investigation (dirty due to issues with hidden files, etc. as discussed above.) Start in the root and work down.\nI would agree this is a very odd problem. Perhaps try selectively disabling services to see if you can get it to stop? As far as indexing goes, the only things running system-wide as standard that I can think of should be locate/mlocate. There's also apt-xapian which indexes packages, mandb which indexes man pages.\nAre you logging in to this machine with a desktop session? If so, does the problem stop if you do log in (at least graphically)?\n", "Q: I have ideas for apps for Ubuntu. How do I submit ideas for apps?

I mean it should be telling me the percentage of Nmap. Starts from 0%, when Namp is done, it will be 100%.\n\nA: Pipe viewer is for reporting percentage completion of files, pipes, and other file-like things. Nmap's completion times depend on network latencies, bandwidth, responsiveness of targets, and the features used to scan.\nYou can get a periodic status update with the --stats-every flag, like so: nmap --stats-every 10s, which gives an update every 10 seconds. You can get more verbose output from Nmap with the -v flag. \n\nA: I doubt you could do a progress bar for NMap, as it scans for IPs and stuff, and that depends on network speeds, etc.\nBut you could do a simple bash script to send a notification when it has finished  instead:\n#!/bin/bash\nnmap \"$@\";\nnotify-send 'Notifaction' 'Nmap has finished!'\necho \"Finished!\"\nexit\n\nSave it to a file called ~/.nmap or something.\nMake it executable with chmod +x ~/.nmap.\nExecute it with the options you normally give for nmap, but with ~/.nmap instead - for example:\n~/.nmap -A 192.168.1.5\n\nthen it will do a notification to say it has finished:\n\nI find this is useful after a network reset, and I need to find the new IP of the network printer in a hurry.

The PC is empty and as I need a local server for some web development work I decided to install 12.04 Server on it.  CD installing ok until I got to the drives part. \n\nOne or more drives containing Serial ATA RAID cofig found ... Activate Y/N?\n\nWhether I select \"Y\" or \"N\" I end up in the Partition Disks menu. \n - Configure LVM\n - Config Encrypted Vol\n - Config iSCSI vol\n - RAID 1 device #126 - 78.2 Gb Software RAID device\n -   #1 78.2 GB\n -   512.0 B unusable\n - RAID 1 device #127 - 4.1 Gb Software RAID device\n -   #1 4.1 GB\n -   512.0 B unusable\n\nWhich I presume is telling me I have SoftwareRaid from a previous incarnation - and I don't want it. But I don't seem to be able to get rid of it.  All I can do in the \"#1\" options is erase all data - which I have done. \nI read somewhere that I can only remove the software RAID by booting with Live CD and doing it from there .. I tried (32 bit 12.04.3 CD) but as soon as I go into the \"Try Ubuntu\" I get a million error messages flying past .. unable to find directory/file combinations till it hangs.\nSo where from here?\n\nA: Choose configure raid arrays ( should be the next item up from configure lvm, so you seem to have cut it off in your post ), and delete the software raid arrays if you don't want them.  Since you also got the message about serial ata raid, it seems that you have also used these drives in a fake raid setup.  Most likely your \"hardware raid card\" is a fake raid.  If it is, and you don't need to dual boot with windows, then it is best to avoid that and just go with regular software raid, which is better supported.\nIf you go into the bios and delete the raid array there ( don't just disable the raid functions, actually delete the array ), and that gets rid of the serial ata raid message, then you have a fake raid card and should proceed with setting up a plain software raid array.\n", "Q: What is the universe and the multiverse and how do you use them in the synaptic package manager I have recently installed the synaptic package manager and there are various options  related to the universe and the multiverse in it. what exactly are they and how do you you use the Synaptic package manager with them  \n\nA: Here is a screenshot of the 'Software & Updates' window (part of Ubuntu's default software setup):\n\n\n*\n\n*The main repository is the main software for Ubuntu, and is officially supported by Canonical (Ubuntu's parent company)\n\n*Universe has open-source programs that can be used in Ubuntu, supported by the Ubuntu & linux community.\n\n*Multiverse includes video codecs, encrypted DVD streamers etc, which may not be open-source, and/or may cause legal problems.\n\n*Restricted - Closed-source drivers\n\nYou can also add other repositories/PPAs to download packages from (though please check if you can trust the source of the compiled software!!).

I am looking at the tab \"Addition drivers\" in the \"Software & Updates\" window, and I am seeing 5 options.\n\nIt is quite clear that the last option must be the open source version of my graphic card driver. But what about the other 4? What is each, and which one should I chose to perform better?\n\nA: I've had success with running sudo apt-get install nvidia-current. I feel like this is the most fool-proof way to install the nvidia drivers (and the change will be reflected in the additional drivers dialog)\nIf you have problems with the driver chosen by nvidia-current, you could try to select the other options from additional drivers and see if they work better.\nIf you still have problems, you could try the very latest drivers from the nvidia website, but this I think is a bit more complicated and I've personally never done it.\nI try to stick with the apt package manager as much as possible when installing drivers and software.\nAlso, I would just stick with the open-source drivers if they are working, unless you have a reason to use the proprietary drivers.\n\nA: In my experience, you should leave the system decide the correct driver,\nsince it's an nvidia card there is no support behind it if something goes wrong.\nTo answer your question though, these options are different driver revisions that support your hardware (graphics card), usually the latest the better.\nIf it is also tested, as stated in the brackets, it adds more security to your choice.\nAbout performance I am not an expert, but I guess you have to run some test for your machine.\nYou can have a look on this guide: HOWTO: Install OpenGL/Graphic card Benchmark utility - SVN\n", "Q: ubuntu 12.04 graphic error on boot after update from 10.04 After an update to ubuntu 12.04 from 10.04, I have a strange problem: in grub menu if I select ubuntu kernel 3.2.0-58-generic the graphical interface just hangs there, I get this black screen with a blinking cursor at the top.

The charm store always picks an unique revision for each charm, and the contents of the \"revision\" file does not matter.\nWhen deploying charms from a local repository (local charms), the revision file is honored by Juju, if possible. There can only be one charm with a given name and revision number in any Juju environment (i.e. inside the mongo state database). When deploying a local charm, Juju tries to respect the revision inside the charm, but if this won't be possible (i.e. when there already is a charm in the state DB with the same name and revision), the latest known revision is incremented and stored. The user is notified of the actual revision the charm was deployed with:\n\n\n*\n\n*when using juju deploy from the CLI there is a message saying Added charm \"local:<series>/<name>-<revision> to the environment (e.g. \"local:precise/wordpress-123\");\n\n*when using Juju GUI there will be a similar way to notify the user (this is under development right now).\n\n\nSo, going back to the question: a charm author is expected to keep their charm sources into a version control system somewhere, like on launchpad, bitbucket, github, etc. This is the proper way to maintain version information and keep all the history. The revision file inside the charm source does not guarantee uniqueness and does not provide a solid way to refer to a specific charm version (inside a single environment or across multiple environments using the same charm).\n", "Q: Why is my grep + regex not working? I recently decided that enough was enough -- I was going to learn to use grep fluently.

In fact, the first grep expression produces no output, even though it seems to work on Regex101.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\nA: If you want to use Perl regex syntax you need -P switch with grep.

Then in the other partition create an extended partition with a logical partition so you can add other logical partitions if you need them.\nYour partition table would look something like:\nPrimary 1 - sda1 (ntfs - Windows)\nPrimary 2 - sda2 (ntfs - Windows)\nPrimary 3 - sda3 (ext4 - Ubuntu)\nPrimary 4 - (if needed)   \n\nExtended Partition:\n    Logical - sda4 (Linux Swap)\n    Logical - sda5 (if needed)\n\nThis is if your hard drive is configured for MBR and if you hard drive has space for a 2nd OS.

The existing live CD/USB code supports persistence, it's just a question of creating a persistence file on the iPod and having the casper initrd scripts find it.\nOnce you've mounted the iPod, change directory to where it has appeared (usually /media/xxxx), and create a blank file with dd:\ndd if=/dev/zero bs=$((1024*1024)) of=casper-rw count=<size in megs>\n\nthen format the file(!):\nmke2fs casper-rw\n\nAfter that, boot your live USB with the \"persistent\" command line option added, and it should work - you can check by running mount or losetup to see if the casper-rw file off the iPod has been mounted correctly.\nIf it doesn't work, it's worth downloading the source to the casper package, and examining the various start-up scripts to study the boot process.

Windows boot partitions are particularly risky for this type of operation.\nAnother possibility entirely is that you're running into rounding problems in the partitioning software. The libparted library (upon which Ubuntu's installer, GParted, parted, and various other tools rely) will try to round the start and end points of partitions to 1MiB boundaries by default. If existing partitions are not aligned in this way, libparted may try adjusting the specified start point, thus moving it into an overlap with an existing partition. The program then responds with an \"unable to satisfy all constraints\" message. The solution in this case is to create your partitions with small gaps between the new partition(s) and existing ones. A 1MiB gap should be sufficient, but it's conceivable you'll need a 2MiB gap. Creating partitions with another tool, such as fdisk or gdisk, may help, too. Be aware of the reasons for 1MiB alignment, though. I wrote this article on the subject some time ago. (An update is in the works, but hasn't yet been published.)\n\nA: You may have at most four primary partitions.  You are probably maxed out, so cannot create any more.  Minimum, you will need to create a root (/) partition and a swap partition.  You need to make a primary partition an extended partition, and then make logical partitions inside that (Ubuntu doesn't care if its partitions are primary or logical).  If you only have 3 primaries, then create an extended partition with the free space, and then make the root and swap logical partitions in the extended.  use  any disk partitioning tool for this.  If you have 4 primaries, you need to back up one, delete it, remake the free space into an extended partition, make a logical partition to restore the deleted primary, and then make your root and swap partitions.  You can format the root during the installation.\n\nA: Try to create an ext4 partition on 59 GB unallocated space using Gparted Partition Editor Utility.\nThen run the ubuntu installer and choose something else option to install ubuntu on the created ext4 partition.\n\nA: I'm not clear why the installer is having trouble here, but you could try creating the partitions you need/want manually with gparted, and then selecting those manually during the installation. Even if it doesn't work, gparted may give you a more informative error message.\n\nA: Solved by adding 1MB before and 1MB after the partition. With Gparted it sounds like that\n", "Q: Processor Tunable status according to Powertop I am absolutely new to the LINUX platform, since I just migrated to Ubuntu 13.10 from Windows8. I installed powertop so that I could assess my processor. The Tunables window of the output returned by the $ sudo powertop command really came as a shock to me. Most of the entries were bad. Do I need to be worried? Is there something I should do about it? Please suggest\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but I had the same one, and did a little research and experimentation, the results of which I thought I would share here. \nFirst of all, I don't think you need to be worried by the scary \"BAD\" label, but it shouldn't hurt to toggle them to GOOD.\nFor me, my battery discharge rate was around 25-30 W. I randomly toggled 3 or 4 of the BAD settings to GOOD, and the rate dropped down to 10-12 W. I then decided to go all in and use the command sudo powertop --auto-tune which changes all the BAD settings to GOOD. This brought my discharge rate down to the 8-10 W range, dropped my temp down by about 10 degrees, and brought the remaining battery life estimate up by about an hour. \nI am also new to Linux, so I am not sure about the consequences of changing these settings, but I am willing to take a chance because I am using an old laptop with a bad battery which instantly exhibited better performance with the help of powertop. That is just my personal experience. Also, see here for a better, more detailed answer to a similar question.\n", "Q: Duplicate copy of ubuntu I run the Ubuntu software three separate times because I couldn't get my computer to boot  after I finished the installation. I finally get it to work after running boot-repair but I think I have three copy of the software on my computer. How do I uninstall the two extra copies\n\nA: I assume you have 1 HDD and at least 3 partitions with 3 seperate installations of Ubuntu. Deleting the installation should be easy: Just delete the partitions that you don't want anymore and probably resize your root or home partition.\nOf course you need to know which partitions are safe to delete. When you use GParted currently mounted partitions are shown as locked and need to be unmounted first before they can be deleted. Which brings us to the mount command. You can use mount to display which device (like an HDD or partition of an HDD) is mounted to which location in your operating system filesystem.\n$ mount\n/dev/sda1 on / type ext4 (rw,errors=remount-ro,discard)\nproc on /proc type proc (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)\nsysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)\nnone on /sys/fs/cgroup type tmpfs (rw)\nnone on /sys/fs/fuse/connections type fusectl (rw)\nnone on /sys/kernel/debug type debugfs (rw)\nnone on /sys/kernel/security type securityfs (rw)\nudev on /dev type devtmpfs (rw,mode=0755)\ndevpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,noexec,nosuid,gid=5,mode=0620)\n\nIn this case partition /dev/sda1 is the root filesystem (/) of the currently running operating system, and we don't want to delete that. So the other partitions containing Ubuntu/Linux installations can be considered as safe to delete.\nYou should look at the filesystems (mount them in nautilus) and check twice before you delete the partitions with GParted. (May be check or backup the home folder first?)\nI do not recommend to use only device names for making such a decision, instead you should compare filesystem UUIDs from your /etc/fstab instead.\nTo clean up your GRUB configuration you just run sudo update-grub.\n", "Q: Why is Python V3.3 installed by default on Xubuntu 13.10? I am running Xubuntu 13.10, 64 bit.\npython --version outputs Python 2.7.5+ which is normal since python 2.7 is installed by default on all Linux distros.\nBut when I go to Software center -> and click on the installed tab -> development tools.

I just got a new laptop from a friend and I'm decent with computers, however, I am a HUGE noob when it comes to Linux OS (besides backtrack (; ). I downloaded gparted, but there is no way that I am able to create a partition as they are all mounted and in use. Will I need to back up everything on this HDD and then wipe it in order to make a partition to dual boot Windows? I'd rather not go through all that trouble. I have a valid copy of Win7 Ultimate and I'd really like to have a nice laptop with a couple of decent OSes on it. Please help!!\n\nA: You can right-click on a partition with GParted, and select Unmount. From there, you should be able to shrink your partition. You probably won't need to make any backups, although backing up is still a good idea, especially when editing partitions (just in case something goes wrong).\nOr, you can shrink the Windows partition from within Windows, by right-clicking on My Computer, select Storage from the pane on the right, and click Disk Management. Right-click the partition you want to shrink, and select Shrink Volume. From there, you can specify how many MB's you want to remove from the total size.\n\nA: You can't unmount an in-use partition. It's sometimes possible to unmount a partition after you stop using it -- for instance, if you log out of a regular user account and log in as root, you can unmount /home. (Ubuntu doesn't give root a password by default, though, so doing this would require deviating from the accepted Ubuntu practice.) Most Ubuntu users also create a simple setup with just one or two Ubuntu filesystem partitions. This can make it difficult or impossible to resize partitions while the Ubuntu installation is in use.\nAs a practical matter, therefore, resizing Ubuntu partitions often requires booting an emergency disc/live CD. Your Ubuntu installer should do fine -- just select the option to \"try before installing\" (if I recall the phrasing correctly).\n", "Q: Why is plymouthd crashing on startup? Every time my laptop boots, I am greeted by several \"Ubuntu 13.10 has experienced an internal error\" dialogs once the graphical desktop environment (whatever it's called) is displayed. Apparently the problem originates from plymouthd, which is (unsurprisingly) the daemon of the Plymouth boot splash application. \nHas anyone ever found a fix for this type of issue?\n(I would provide log excerpts but I'm not sure where to find them.)\n\nA: A possible solution not mentioned here is to run:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure Plymouth\n\nFrom: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-gnome-default-settings/+bug/1536771\n\nA: I have experienced the same error when I first installed Ubuntu 13.10 on the toshiba harman/kardon this week.\nI solved the error with a single command:\nOpen a Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and type:\nsudo chown -R $USER: /lib/plymouth\n\nThen all the permission issues are solved and the error is gone in the next boot.\n\nA: sudo apt-get install plymouth-x11 \n\nThat did help me with the issue.\n\nA: I was experiencing this problem, also. I found out that /lib/plymouth did not exist. I installed plymouth using Synaptic (but you can use whatever pkg installer you like), and it fixed the problem.\nThere are other plymouth packages, but it looked like they were already installed for Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 64 bit, which is what I am using. I also discovered that when I installed Ubuntu GNOME 16.04 32 bit, I didn't have this problem. For me, it was only a problem with the 64 bit install.\n\nA: In my case (Ubuntu Gnome 17.04), when I looked at the error details, it said the error was that /var/log/boot.log didn't exist.

I have installed Ubuntu in my chromebook but it only boots into chrome OS. My goal is to have my Chromebook booting into Ubuntu.\n\nA: Once you have installed Ubuntu, if you reboot your Chromebook, by default it will continue to boot into Chrome OS, which lives on in its own dedicated partition.\nIf you'd like ChrUbuntu to be the default, open up the Terminal in ChrUbuntu (or the Developer Console command prompt in Chrome OS) and enter sudo cgpt add -i 6 -P 5 -S 1 /dev/sda to change the default boot partition. Changing it back to Chrome OS is as easy as disabling developer mode when you boot the Chromebook, or entering sudo cgpt add -i 6 -P 0 -S 1 /dev/sda at the terminal.\nEDIT I:\nSet boot priority\nAt this point we should have the following situation:\n\n\n*\n\n*Image-A is an official Google Chrome OS which can boot either in normal mode or dev-mode.\n\n*Image-B is (or will be after the first autoupdate) another official Google Chrome OS which can boot either in normal mode or dev-mode.\n\n*Image-C is Chrome OS kernel with a modified command line and an Ubuntu rootfs, which can only boot in dev-mode.\n\n\nNext, we adjust the priority among the images so we can try out our Ubuntu image. The image priority is an attribute of its kernel partition.  Run cgpt show /dev/sda, to see the kernel priorities:\n\nlocalhost ~ # cgpt show /dev/sda\n...\n 4096     32768       2  Label: \"KERN-A\"\n                         Type: ChromeOS kernel\n                         UUID: D176DC60-81F1-654E-8953-E3D28019738C\n                         Attr: priority=3 tries=0 successful=1\n\n...\n36864     32768       4  Label: \"KERN-B\"\n                         Type: ChromeOS kernel\n                         UUID: F1A2C65C-CC22-FF4A-A8BC-67BA233F3D40\n                         Attr: priority=0 tries=15 successful=0\n\n...\n12369920     32768       6  Label: \"KERN-C\"\n                         Type: ChromeOS kernel\n                         UUID: B6954485-4295-9749-956A-C315B01FB684\n                         Attr: priority=0 tries=15 successful=0\n\n\nThe priority determines the order in which the BIOS tries to find a valid kernel (bigger is higher, zero means don't even try). The tries field is decremented each time the BIOS tries to boot it, and if it's zero, the kernel is considered invalid (this lets us boot new images without looping forever if they don't work). The successful field overrides the tries field, but is only set by the OS once it's up and running.\nLet's change the priority of KERN-C to 5:\ncgpt add -i 6 -P 5 -T 1 -S 0 /dev/sda\nThis makes KERN-C the highest priority, but only gives us one chance to boot it. That way if it doesn't work, we're not completely stuck.\nIf you reboot now, you should come up in Ubuntu!  Note that Computer Science Standard Answer #1 applies: It Works For Me™\nIf something went wrong and Ubuntu crashes or you powered off, the tries field for KERN-C will have been decremented to 0 and you'll fall back to booting Chrome OS.\nAssuming that Ubuntu booted and you could log in, go to Applications->Accessories->Terminal to get a shell, and run\nsudo cgpt add -i 6 -P 5 -S 1 /dev/sda\nThis will mark the Ubuntu kernel as valid, so it will continue to boot next time.\nNow you can switch back and forth between the official Chrome OS release and Ubuntu just by flipping the dev-mode switch. Going from dev-mode to normal mode erases STATE (/dev/sda1), but much more quickly. Going from normal to dev-mode again would normally do a slow erase of /dev/sda1, but since we're booting Ubuntu that doesn't happen.\nThis works because although KERN-C has the highest priority, it isn't signed by Google. In dev-mode that's okay, but in normal mode it will be rejected by the BIOS. Since we've set the successful flag to 1, the BIOS won't mark it invalid but will just skip it each time. This makes the normal-mode boot time slightly longer, but only by a second or two. \nOf course you could also switch between images from within dev-mode just by manually setting the priorities with cgpt before rebooting.\nNote that if the normal image autoupdates, it will probably change the kernel priorities so that Image-C is no longer the highest and the next time you switch to dev mode, you will\n  a) have a long wait, \n  b) still be running Chrome OS, and \n  c) have to use cgpt to raise the KERN-C priority again. \nBut, because autoupdate only switches between Image-A and Image-B, the Ubuntu kernel and rootfs shouldn't be affected.\n\nA: I don't have enough reputation to comment on the above post unfortunately, and my post is too long for a comment, so I'll clarify the problem with your console, Brian.\nYour problem is that you're not even in the console. That's why you get \"Unknown command: sudo\" and \"Unknown command: cgpt\". You're not in a full Linux shell. \nHow to fix: After going into the console with ctrl+alt+T, type \"shell\" without quotation marks. Then you'll be able to execute the commands helpfully provided by Hans. \nThanks,\nNum\nP.S. I tried your method, Hans, and there's a slight problem. I don't have a kernel C.  However, the console accepted the cgpt add -i 6 -P 5 -T 1 -S 0 /dev/sda command without an error. When I rebooted, the screen turned on but stayed black, then off, then flashed black again, then gave me the \"OS verification is OFF\" message. I pressed ctrl+D, and, after a couple more flashes of black between quick power-offs of the monitor, it booted successfully... into ChromeOS. Do I need to apt-get headers or something? I know KERN-C is supposed to be on the cgpt show /dev/sda list. My laptop is an Acer C710 if that helps. I realize this problem is mainly occurring on Acers.\n", "Q: Wireless driver Lenovo Flex 14 Ubuntu 12 Ultrabook I recently bought a Lenovo Ideapad Flex 14 and the wireless card is not working and there are issues with the brightness when I start the computer. \nI tried the tips that are already given for the same issues for the yoga 13, but I can't bring it to work.\nAny ideas how to get the wireless working?\n\nA: I have bought Lenovo Flex-15 and faced the same problem with WiFi driver.

This is one of the major security features we have to prevent our system from malware and accidental file removal.\nApplication binaries have their defined location in the filesystem as was specified in the DEBIAN package. For any Debian related distribution we have a Filesystem Hierarchy Standard to help maintaining the system. Applications must meed this standard to be included in a distribution.\nWhenever an application needs user setting they will be stored in a separate directory on your HOME directory (ususally in a hidden dot file in ~/.config/<app_name>/, or ~/.appname/).\nIn the rare case we need to change system-wide application settings we need to do that with root privileges which can be reached by using sudo.\n\nRunning the chown command recursively as root bears a great risk to break your system.

Then you choose to select an existing virtual hard disk file and attach your old .vdi which you released before.\n\nA: The problem with trying to attach a virtual disk that was previously attached is that VirtualBox remembers that disk's UUID.  The easiest way to reattach a disk that was previously detached is to change the UUID of the disk image.\nYou can run the following commands (note that you want the quotes around your image path to preserve spaces in the path):\nvboxmanage internalcommands sethduuid \"your old image\" $(uuidgen)\nVBoxManage modifyvm \"your vm name\" --hda \"your old image\"\n\n\nA: In the above procedure you may get an error \"Failed to open the disk image file\".\nThe better option I would suggest is to create a new virtual machine.

I have one system where /var/log/syslog is written to as expected, and another system where it can't be written to unless I stop rsyslog service and run it manually with \"rsyslog -d\".\nHow do I debug this problem?  I tried deleting everything in /etc/rsyslog.d/,  recreating it.    \nI tried removing and reinstalling rsyslogd\napt-get remove rsyslogd and apt-get install rsyslogd ubuntu-minimal\n\nand then checked that service is running but only the other logs are being updated, not /var/log/syslog.\nI am just trying to have the default configuration of rsyslog working.\nI noticed that /var/log/syslog is root:adm instead of syslog:adm.  The log files that are syslog user work ok.   If I make /var/log/syslog syslog:adm, then it starts working.  Perhaps the permissions are broken somehow.  Doesn't logrotate change the permissions / create these files again later?  Not sure if the fix will be permanent or not.\n\nA: You've already determined that it's a file permissions issue, and that the user specified for the service in /etc/rsyslog.conf is unable to write to the log file.  However your logon user (presumably root) does have access when run interactively.  Here's an example of the section of rsyslog.conf which specifies the service user configuration:\n#\n# Set the default permissions for all log files.\n#\n$FileOwner syslog\n$FileGroup adm\n$FileCreateMode 0640\n$DirCreateMode 0755\n$Umask 0022\n$PrivDropToUser syslog\n$PrivDropToGroup syslog\n\nAs for logrotate, you may configure how the syslog files are managed, see /etc/logrotate.conf and /etc/logrotate.d/rsyslog.  Here's a sample:\n/var/log/syslog\n{\n        rotate 7\n        daily\n        missingok\n        notifempty\n        delaycompress\n        compress\n        postrotate\n                reload rsyslog >/dev/null 2>&1 || true\n        endscript\n}\n\nOn my test system, logrotate.conf also contains:\n# rotate log files weekly\nweekly\n\n# keep 4 weeks worth of backlogs\nrotate 4\n\n# create new (empty) log files after rotating old ones\ncreate\n\nFrom man logrotate:\ncreate mode owner group\n    Immediately after rotation (before the postrotate script is run) the log file is created (with the same name  as  the  log\n    file  just  rotated).   mode specifies the mode for the log file in octal (the same as chmod(2)), owner specifies the user\n    name who will own the log file, and group specifies the group the log file will belong to. Any of the log file  attributes\n    may  be omitted, in which case those attributes for the new file will use the same values as the original log file for the\n    omitted attributes. This option can be disabled using the nocreate option.\n\nSo in my case, the create option determines how the new file attributes are set, because the options specified in /etc/logrotate.d/rsyslog do not override that global setting.  When mode, owner and group are not specified, logrotate uses the same values as the original log file.\nHopefully, that gets you started.  Good luck!\n", "Q: Internal Error?

I want to triple boot these with Ubuntu 13.10. How do I do this?\n\nA: *\n\n*Boot Ubuntu live-disk and select Try Ubuntu option on startup.\n\n*Now open Gparted Partition Editor from Dash and create a separate ext4 partition (primary or logical) for Ubuntu.\n\n*Now run the Ubuntu installer and choose something else option to install Ubuntu on a newly created ext4 partition.\n\n*After Ubuntu installation has completed, run boot-repair if necessary.\n\nA: Triple Booting works much the same as dual booting. Install the first OS and then install the second and so on. The only things that I have found that you have to watch out for is to have a separate partition for each OS that you want on the system and if you are installing MS Windows, Windows must be installed first as the windows installer has a tendency to delete the grub bootloader and install its own. \nfor futher reading check out these links:\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=857214\nHow do I triple-boot Ubuntu, Fedora and Windows 7?\nCan you triple-boot safely?\n", "Q: Keryx - Installing Applications From Hard Drive How can I use Keryx to download applications not found in Synaptic Repositories or which I have on my hard drive?\nKeryx v0.92.4 (Portable),\nUbuntu 10.04\n\nA: Use Gdebi to install applications that are on the hard drive.\nTo install gdebi, open a terminal via dash and type.  \nsudo apt-get install gdebi\n\nNow back to keryx, you can just add required repository to your system by typing following in the terminal\nsudo add-apt-repository {your ppa repository here}\n\nThen the repository will be available in keryx as well.\nTo know which PPA you actually need to add,you can visit the homepage or launchpad page of the application.

I'm trying to find out how to run a command in the background and then bring it to the foreground later. I'm fed up of tutorials and answers where people state that it's simple, just append & to the end of the command to get it run in the background. It's working only within  a single terminal window.

Not exactly what you are looking for, but it has similar behavior.\nbyobu-screen\n\nThen run your command, to detach:\nbyobu-screen -d\n\nTo resume:\nbyobu-screen -r\n\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Screen\n\nA: *\n\n*Install screen:\nsudo apt-get install screen\n\n\n*Start screen:\nscreen -S session_name\n\n\n*Execute your commands what you need.\n\n*Detach screen from the terminal (your commands will be still running):\nPress CTRL+a+d\n\n*Close the terminal\n\n*Open another terminal and reattach the last screen session:\nscreen -r\n\nFor more information and extra options for screen look in man screen.\n\nA: It's impossible in the way you want.\nLet's review some basic concepts:\n\n\n*\n\n*A process group is a collection of related processes which can all be signalled at once.  \n\n*A session is a collection of process groups, which are either attached to a single terminal device (known as the controlling terminal) or not attached to any terminal.\n\n\nIf you closed the terminal, all the processes in the session are dead except those (daemons) reparented to the init process. And there's no way to give them a controlling terminal again.   \nIn a word, process reparenting is highly restricted in POSIX systems (daemonizing is an exception) and your requirements can't be satisfied.\n", "Q: Skype and problem with terminal Recently, I have installed ubuntu 13.04, and updated it.\nI want to install skype. I search in \"ubuntu software center\" but I did not find anything. Therefore, I search on internet. I found out some commands for skype installation.\nThen, I open the terminal and type the command. it request for password. The problem is that when i want to enter my password, my keyboard did not work and I can not type my password.\nHow can I fix that?\nThanks\n\nA: Normally when you type your password for sudo it won't appear,don't consider it a keyboard problem. If all your keys on the keyboard were working it means that there was no problem with your keyboard.\nIf some keys which was essential for typing the password weren't working then your best option is onboard. Search for the onboard application in Dash. It will allow you to type in the password without using the keyboard. \n\nA: Installation of Skype requires a little bit more work since it is closed-source proprietary software. It can be found in the Ubuntu Software Center only if the \"Canonical Partners\" repository is enabled. You can do this in many different ways: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype The easiest way for you is via the Ubuntu Software Center -> Edit -> Software Sources. There you have to check the box next to \"Canonical Partners\" in the \"Other Software\" tab. Btw your problem with typing in the terminal (at least from the scarce info that you have given us) does NOT seem connected to Skype itself (since it is not even installed on your system).\nA piece of advice: don't just write any command you find on the internet even if the one who posted it states that it IS the solution. Always check and double-check. Also when you post a question like this without giving ANY useful information the probability that you get a (quick) reply decreases a lot. When you say that you have \"typed in some command\" the people who come here to see your question in detail with the intend to answer it start scratching their heads \"What command? Where did he/she find it?\". Frankly I needed to read 2-3 times your question in order to (maybe) understand what you want to do, which omho is a waste of time (my time at least).\n\nA: What both previous answers got right is that that the command was probably sudo. (As it requires a password and won't show it onscreen being typed.)\nWhat both answers failed to mention is that this is being done by sudo on purpose. This is so that you can safely type in your password even if someone's watching over your shoulder (the proper term is shoulder-surfing) at an airport or a coffee shop or whatever.\n", "Q: Right path to CPP SDK for using it in IntelliJ Idea's cpp-project I can't find the right path to CPP SDK which is required by IntelliJ Idea, IDE that I want to use for developing a C++ project.

Is there any requirements for a disk to be recognized as bootable. I have the DVD ROM appearing there even when its empty or there is no botable disk in there.\n\nA: When you have an image of a Linux installation, e.g. an .iso file, you can copy it to a sd card using dd.\nAn example of dd usage:\ndd if=/path/to/linux.iso of=/dev/sdx bs=4M\n\nWhere if is the path to the image, of is the path to the sd card and bs is the block size. \nIf you want to keep track of the progress you can use pv, For an accurate progress you've to give the size of the image.\ndd if=/path/to/linux.iso | pv -s 2G | dd of=/deb/sdx\n\nNow it should appear in the list of bootable media.\n\nA: you can use (unetbootin) program for make a usb drive bootable.\n\nA: It seems error with the bootable device you made.

Once the terminal is opened, type pwd to locate which directory currently you're in. pwd will display an output like below\n/root/folder/\n\nIf your .sh file is in user's downloads directory as I mentioned above, then use cd command to navigate to the downloads folder. see below;\ncd /home/user/downloads\n\nonce entered, again check whether you're in that directory by using pwd command. If you're in that directory then simply type ls command to list down the files. Once you see your .sh file, simply type below command to execute the file.\nsudo sh shell_file.sh\n\nterminal will ask you to type the root (admin) password which will not be visible while you type. simply type the password & enter. That's it, the execution will process.\nThis is just an assumption; assuming your file located in a directory. I hope this very basic and simplified process which will make you more clear.\nHope it helps! :)\nEDIT: I've edited the document by adding sh command at the last step.\n\nA: first give full permission to that .sh file\nsudo chmod 755 YOUR_FILENAME\n\nsecond run .sh file by following command inside ur CLI\nsudo ./YOUR_FILENAME\n\n**YOUR_FILENAME is full path of your file, where it is situated.\n", "Q: How exactly do files get opened from Nautilus? I am asking this out of curiosity, to know what goes on 'behind the scenes' when I double click a file in a file browser, say Nautilus. Specifically, what parameters is the executable executed with? Where does the .desktop file come into play, and how does Nautilus send the filename?\nThis was relevant to me once when Okular would open multiple instances of the same file, and I had to write a shell script, which used to fail because the filename didn't get passed properly. (Spaces in the filenames would get converted into an HTML %20 character, and I had to figure out a lot how exactly filenames are passed.)\n\nA: There are two directories that contain .desctop files: /usr/share/applications/ (global list for all users) and ~/.local/share/applications/ (for a particular user). Both directories contain a list of file type associations (defaults.list and mimeapps.list correspondingly).\nWhen you click a file, Nautilus finds the appropriate .desctop file and launches your program. Each .desctop file contains the Exec key which specifies the command line (the program and its parameters). See this document for details on the Exec key.\nIf a .desctop file specifies a program without the full path, it will be looked up on your $PATH. In a default installation, $PATH usually includes the following directories: /usr/local/sbin, /usr/local/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/bin, /sbin, /bin.\n", "Q: Why .Xauthority needs not to be owned by the root account in order to get past login? I've just got the same problem from here, and solved it using what was stated in the first answer (akonsu's one).\nHowever, I would love to know why ~/.Xauthority needs not to be owned by the root account in order to get past login with a regular user (in other words: why is that the reason for the login failure), and - do you have an assumption as to how akonsu found that as a solution?\n\nA: This is part of the mechanism used by X server to authenticate client programs.\nrefer to X Window authorization\n\nThe cookie-based authorization methods are based on choosing a magic cookie (an arbitrary piece of data) and passing it to the server when it is started; every client that can prove having knowledge of this cookie is then authorized connection to the server.\nThese cookies are created by a separate program and stored in the file .Xauthority in the user's home directory, by default. As a result, every program run by the client on the local computer can access this file and therefore the cookie that is necessary for being authorized by the server. If the user wants to start an application from another computer on the network, the cookie has to be copied to that other computer.\n\nwhen ~/.Xauthority is owned by the root account, normal X client programs couldn't read it and wouldn't be authenticated by X server. this mostly leads to crash.\n", "Q: Why can't I install compiz-plugins-extra?

I tried running the command sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager compiz-plugins-extra, but it says the most recent version is already installed. Does anybody know what should be done in such a case?\n\nA: If it tells you that \"recent version is already installed\" is because it's already installed. There were a bunch of plugins removed from the packages that were deemed as unstable, those you will not find them for the normal channels for obvious reasons.\n\nA: had the same problem I ran sudo apt-get update \nto install the recent updates.\nThen sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager compiz-plugins-extra\nWorked like a charm,\n", "Q: How to recover my system from a failed upgrade due connection lost?

And if so, how can I save all my data and stuff?\n\nA: If you can't connect to the internet because the function is missing, you will most likely have to re-install Ubuntu. That said, backing up your data is easy as Ubuntu install discs have a live session you can use to access files on the computer.\nJust boot up the install disc (I recommend the 13.10 release, so you don't have to upgrade again) and choose Try Ubuntu. Let it complete loading and you can now navigate through all your files. Just plug-in a USB drive with enough space on it, and copy all the stuff you need to the new drive.

For external dependencies, it depends. Many external dependencies should not be downloaded from a website, but installed from the Ubuntu repositories.\nFor instance, the OpenGL headers are available from libgl1-mesa-dev (which installs mesa-common-dev). \nThis makes the headers available in /usr/include/GL/gl.h.\nIn other cases where the header file is not located in the same directory, specify the different include directories while compiling. Example where you have a directory external-deps containing header files:\ncc -I external-deps source.c -o output-program\n\nIf there are libraries involved (example for an OpenGL program using libGL):\ncc -I external-deps source.c -o output-program -L path/to/libraries -lGL\n\n", "Q: Ubuntu Server setup, sync folders, available offline, music etc I am setting up a Ubuntu Server (13.10) for my home network and need some suggestions on how to go about setting up shares, offline files etc. Here is what I am trying to accomplish:\n\n\n*\n\n*Ability to have local folders backed up on the server automatically both on Ubuntu clients and Windows clients. I would like these folders locally not on the server but when a change is made on the client and if the Server is available have the contents on the Server updated. This sounds like I would want to setup a Cloud Server but have also seen suggestions for rsync and other programs. Not sure which way to go about it.\n\n*There are Music and Video directories are on the server and would like these available to all clients on the local network but additionally would like to setup a SSH server or something similar so these directories can be accessed from the internet, cell phones and other devices. I am not sure how to make these directories available to all devices especially cell phones, will this require some custom programming?\n\n*I installed Lubuntu Desktop on the server so I can have a GUI to do administration tasks but have disabled the automatic start-up of the Desktop. I can start the Desktop GUI by using the startx command, however I am not sure how to shut down the Desktop GUI without having to reboot. Basically I just want a on-demand Desktop GUI.\n\n*Is there a way to setup a script on the server that would automatically mount folders as drives on both Ubuntu and Windows clients? I would like to have a global disk structure between all the clients on the local network\nI have done research on these items but have come across several options that just seem to be over complicated and/or obsolete. Obviously I want to keep things as simple and easy to administer as I can because I tend to over complicate things ;-) Thank you for the help!\nAndy\n\nA: This is what I would do based on past experiences - note that I have not tried all the available options so there might be things that will work better.\n\n\n*\n\n*BitTorrent Sync will allow to sync the files as they update (question about BitTorrent Sync Install). The backup program that is installed with Ubuntu will also work, but does not does not backup automatically at each change (uses intervals). I have tried Owncloud in the past, but got frustrated at the constant conflict files it created. I have little experience with rsync, but most backup programs use it if I'm correct.\n\n*SSH would be best. Most smartphones's (or at least Android's) file-managers allow you to connect to ssh (might be listed as sftp). You might also want to try local media streaming (I have to experience with that).\n\n*You can try sudo killall X in one of the tty's. An alternative is to look into something like Webmin, Ajenti or Zentyal to administer the server remotely in a GUI (I personally prefer Zentyal then Ajenti...).\n\n*I don't know of any other than setting them up manually on each client. Others should be able to suggest something. You might wanna try to ssh into each client and then run a mount command(s), would be my best suggestion.\n\n", "Q: Changes made to html / css / js (stored on NTFS partition) are lost I edit web pages (saved on NTFS partition) using Komodo Edit.

I decided to upgrade, which was certainly a mistake but am trying to correct for the results of my status as a Linux novice. \nI am running a Dell Evo. I attempted to upgrade to 13.10 and the installation hung. I did a little research and found that sometimes a USB keyboard causes a failure. I replaced with a PS2 and the installation went without issue. Restarting the system after install, I found that all personal items were on the desktop and accessible but all the pinned programs, software icons on the left side were absent. \nThrough a link on my desktop I was able to get to the web and began reading. I discovered what may be my major error. I failed to upgrade step by step through each new version. Because everything I have is cloud backed up, I decided to reinstall a new version alongside the partially operative version but found that I could not close the browser. After exhausting other options, I did a hard restart and installed another version alongside. Starting that installation gave me a totally blank background. The only action possible was a right click that allowed the creation of a new file.\nI am now considering either a reformat or a new hard drive and a totally clean install of 13.10.

Background:\nI have an 8-disk Network Attached Storage device. I've been having issues with it where the hard drives fail on a regular basis. I figured out what the problem is with this: firmware issues with Seagate HDDs being compatible with my QNAP. So I need to update the firmware on each of the 8 HDDs.  Each of the HDDs are 3TB in size.  Previously, when one failed, I told the NAS to rebuild it (since I used RAID 5), and it took somewhere between 42-44 hours to do.\nCurrent Problem:\nI am using DD to capture an image of one of the 3TB HDDs.  It is plugged into my other laptop via eSATA and the drive I am writing to is on a USB 3.0 connection.  When I first started the image, I did the math to figure out how much time would be needed to finish.  My calculations based on how long DD was running (via PS) and how much data had been written (via LS), it looked to be the same (42-44 hours).

FFmpeg is actively developed, but the Ubuntu packages are outdated and they switched to libav. See here for the bug report that discusses the wording of the message.\nInstalling from source or using a static build\nIf you're not into compiling yourself, you can simply grab a static build either from Burek or Relaxed. Extract the folder and use the ffmpeg binary that's in there.\nIf you want to stay up to date and configure the tool yourself you'll need to compile it from source. Check the Ubuntu compilation guide for a detailed howto on installation. Following these steps, you'll end up with the newest version of both FFmpeg (the encoding tool) and x264 (a certain video encoder).\nWhat do I need to reduce the size?\nYou ask …\nwhich file formats and compression methods are recommended these days\nIn fact, there's only one compression method (\"codec\") everyone would recommend. It's the h.264 or MPEG-4 Part 10 / AVC standard, which specifies a compression method for low bandwidth video. h.264 also achieves great results for higher bandwidths. A very common encoder for it is called \"x264\", the one we've installed above.\nIt supersedes MPEG-4 Part 2, the video codec standard that made the \"DivX\" and \"XviD\" encoders famous. These are good too, but they need more bandwidth to preserve the same quality.\nThe actual file format does not matter. h.264 video can reside in almost any container, from AVI to MP4, MOV and MKV. It's important to know the difference between a video codec per se, and the container that simply encapsulates it. See here for more: What is a Codec (e.g. DivX?), and how does it differ from a File Format (e.g. MPG)? I would choose MP4 or MKV as output container these days. AVI is just too old and doesn't allow you to do much with the video, and for the aforementioned containers there are better tools for remultiplexing available.\nWhen you want to reduce the size, you want to reduce the average bitrate of the video. In the simplest case this would mean forcing the encoder to, let's say, 1.5 MBit/s constant bit rate. This works, but it has a few drawbacks. Instead of encoding with a fixed bit rate, let the encoder choose how much it wants to spend. This results in an average bitrate, adapted to the contents of the video. Do this by using the Constant Rate Factor option.\nFor x264, this means setting a value somewhere between 18 and 26 for this CRF. The default is 23, and higher values will give you worse quality, and vice-versa. You don't need to know exactly what it does, but if you're interested see this CRF guide.\nHow do you perform the conversion?\nOnce you have FFmpeg up and running, you can simply convert a video to x264 / MP4 with AAC audio at 192 kBit/s fixed bitrate:\nffmpeg -i input.avi -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -c:a libfaac -b:a 192k output.mp4\nThat's it. You can vary the output size and quality by adjusting the CRF value. Lower means better quality and larger size. Higher means worse quality and lower size. As I said, sane values are anywhere between 18 and 26, maybe more. If you really want to reduce the size of the input video, choose the CRF value that still delivers acceptable video quality with a reduction of file size.\nTo test how your video would look, you can press Q any time during the conversion. It'll leave a truncated file which should still be playable though. You could also supply the -t  option, where  specifies how long you want to encode (e.g. the first 30 seconds only).\nBatch processing\nIf you have a batch of AVI files that you want to convert, you could do something like that:\nwhile IFS= read -d '' -r file; do \n  ffmpeg -i \"$file\" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -c:a libfaac -b:a 192k ${file%%.avi}-converted.mp4 \ndone < <(find . -iname \"*.avi\" -print0)\nYou can change the .avi suffix in this command and let it run again for other files.\nNote that video encoding is a time consuming task and it takes a while to find the perfect settings for your source files.\n\nA: Video Editors:\n\n*\n\n*Kdenlive\n\n\n*Avidemux\nVideo/Audio format converter/transcoder:\n\n*\n\n*WinFF (winff - video and audio batch converter using ffmpeg\n)\n\n\n*HandBrake\nlink for more alternatives\n", "Q: Boot from USB with 3g/4g Does a small USB stick exist which has built in 3g or 4g, and can be plugged into any computers usb port to boot into linux giving you internet access using the 3g or 4g built into the USB stick which booted linux?\n\nA: \nDoes a small USB stick exist which has built in 3g or 4g, and can be plugged into any computers usb port to boot into linux giving you internet access using the 3g or 4g built into the USB stick which booted linux?\n\nI am somewhat confused by the fact that this question is so short and still has a bounty on it.

I have installed a Ubuntu alongside Pre-installed Windows-8...\nAnd now I have uninstalled Ubuntu. But the problem is that after removing Ubuntu and typing \"bootrec/Fixmbr\" in Command Prompt, there is still showing a boot manager with only one option Windows-8. How can I get rid of this mess?\n\nA: What boot manager appears? The Windows boot manager? If so, you can try the one of the following methods. (The first one is probably easier.)\nBasically, you need to tell the Windows Boot Manager to boot the Windows Boot Loader by default (unless it's already doing this), and then tell the Windows Boot Manager to stop displaying the boot menu.\nPlease note that if you make a mistake during this process, you may no longer be able to boot into Windows. If this happens, your best bet may be to boot into a Windows disc and use the recovery options there. Especially in the case that you were using Method 2, you can even open a command prompt from the disc and try using BCDEdit again.\nMethod 1: Control Panel Options\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the Control Panel (Start -> Control Panel)\n\n*Go to \"System and Security\"\n\n*Go to \"System\"\n\n*Go to \"Advanced System Settings\"\n\n*Go to the \"Advanced\" tab\n\n*Under \"Startup and Recovery\", click \"Settings\"\n\n*Under \"System Startup\" -> \"Default operating system\", choose something like \"Windows 8\"\n\n*Uncheck the option \"Time to display list of operating systems\". You'll notice that the number of seconds changes to 0.\n\n\nI found some of the information for Method 1 here: How to change Windows 7 Boot manager options to start the OS automatically?\nMethod 2: BCDEdit\nBCDEdit is a built-in utility in Windows Vista, 7, & 8 that you should also be able to use to solve your problem.\n1) Make sure Windows is your default boot entry.\n\n\n*\n\n*In Windows, open a command prompt. (e.g. Hold the Windows key and press R.\n\n*In the \"Run\" window that appears, type cmd and press Enter.)\n\n*In the command prompt, run the command bcdedit to display current boot information. There should be an entry called \"Windows Boot Loader\" (NOT \"Windows Boot Manager\"!) followed by a line with \"identifier\" and a long string of characters enclosed by { }. This string is the GUID (or just \"id\" or \"identifier\") of that boot entry.\n\n*Run the command BCDEdit /default id, where where you replace id with the long identifier of the Windows boot entry, to make that boot loader the default one.\n\n\n2) Skip the boot menu so you no longer see it.\nUse the following BCDEdit command to skip the boot menu so you don't see it:\nbcdedit /timeout 0.\nIn this command, 0 is actually the number of seconds the Windows  to display the boot selection screen.\nI found some of the information for Method 2 here:\nBCDEdit Command-Line Options\nChanging the Default Boot Entry\n\nA: If you have a Windows installation DVD or repair CD, you can boot to a repair command prompt and run:(repair/advanced/cmdprompt)\nenter:\nbootrec /fixmbr\nThis command installs the Windows bootloader.

I hope this solution is one that works with 12.04 and that it helps all who are stuck on this issue.\n\nA: Luckily, NetBeans is actually in the Ubuntu universe PPA, so it is accessible to anyone with an Ubuntu installation.\nInstalling NetBeans\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal. This can be done by searching for it in your Dash and opening it or typing the combination Ctrl+Alt+T.\n\n*Copy-paste the sudo apt-get install netbeans into the Terminal window you just opened.

Since NetBeans is in the universe repository, it's available to all Ubuntu installations by default, so all you need to do is run a simple apt-get install command with the argument netbeans.\nSince NetBeans is installed in a directory other than /home, it is necessary you prefix it with sudo. This is because you don't own any directories other than your own (/home/USER) but root has access to all directories. The sudo argument tells Terminal to run your command as root so that it can enjoy the elevated permissions necessary to run.\n\nA: Update for XKAL's answer, the ppa:vajdics/netbeans-installer is now available for 12.04 (or later) also.\nNote: For those who use the latest version of ubuntu, an up-to-date version of netbeans is available in the [universe] repository.\n", "Q: How to get back the /var/lib/dkpg folder?

I just ran the upgrade from 13.04 to 13.10, since it's going to be EOL sooner than I'd expected, and had some weird issues with it. Slightly puzzled about whether it's actually worked properly or not.\nEssentially, the installer hung for ages on some font. I opened Firefox to check something quickly, and then when alt-tabbing to a different window the dash disappeared momentarily, and then an error about the package tex-common appeared. I submitted an error report, at which point another message appeared saying \"The upgrade has aborted. Your system could be in an unusable state. A recovery will now run (dpkg --configure -a).\"\nAfter a short while, and a few terminal prompts asking me if I wanted to keep certain config files that had changed (I opted to keep all of them) it popped up again saying \"The upgrade has completed but there were errors during the upgrade process\"\nI ran sudo apt-get purge tex-common as well as sudo apt-get autoremove && sudo apt-get autoclean, since I figured if I got rid of that package the upgrade would work this time around. Ran the software updater again, and it told me to restart the computer to finish updates. I did, and now that it's rebooted the computer seems to think that it's running 13.10 now; \"About this computer\" tells me 13.10, and there is a new icon in the topright corner that has to do with my keyboard layout, which I can only assume is new with this distro.... but I'm not convinced that it's worked properly. \nSo, is this actually running 13.10 now, or could it be some odd hybrid?

(Thankfully I keep the majority of my data on a different partition to my install, but it's still rather a hassle to deal with a reinstall, considering how long I've spent tweaking this to get it working the way I wanted...)\n\nA: Short Answer\nYour computer is technically running 13.10, but it still retains some of 13.04's packages and configuration for tex.\nLong Answer\nWhen doing an in-place upgrade of Ubuntu, your computer needs to find it's way around your configuration. Basically, while using Ubuntu, you and your software did their own configuration, and Ubuntu needs to find a way to cope with it.\nThis can be problematic when doing an in-place upgrade, since Ubuntu is likely to run into a problem it has no solution for. It will try to recover, but this will effect the rest of the installation.\nThis may cause Ubuntu to need to retain software from earlier versions of Ubuntu.

(the pc is always plugged in to mains but not turned on as it will waste electricity)\n\nA: \nWake-on-LAN (WOL) is an Ethernet computer networking standard that allows a shut-down computer to be turned on remotely. Most recent motherboards that have an integrated Ethernet controller that supports this feature. You can enable the Wake-on-LAN feature in the Power Management section of the motherboard’s BIOS. There are two ways of how Wake-on-LAN can work. The first one is you want to turn on a computer on the same local area network and the second one is you want to turn on a computer in another location through the internet.\nThis is how Wake-on-LAN works; the target computer is shut down with enough power reserved for the network card to function. The network card listens for a specific packet called the “Magic Packet”. The listening computer receives this packet, checks it for the correct information, and then boots if the Magic Packet is valid. A magic packet is data consisting of “FF FF FF FF FF FF” followed by 16 repetitions of the listening network device’s MAC address.\n\n\nSetting Up Wake-on-LAN\nIn order to use WoL it must be supported and enabled as necessary in the BIOS, NIC and other network hardware (routers, switches etc). You may also need to configure some software if things don't work out-of-the-box.\nEnabling WoL in the BIOS\nThis section may differ depending on whether or not you have a NIC integrated into your motherboard.\nUsing an Integrated NIC\nTo enable WoL in the BIOS, enter the BIOS setup and look for something called \"Wake up on PCI event\", \"Wake up on LAN\" or similar. Change it so that it is enabled. Save your settings and reboot.\nUsing a Non-Integrated NIC\nIf your NIC is not integrated into your motherboard, you will still have to configure your BIOS to allow devices to wake up your computer. Boot your computer and enter the BIOS settings menu. In one of the sub-menus there will hopefully be the option to allow USB and/or PCI devices to wake-up the computer. Enable the setting that is appropriate for your NIC. Save your settings and reboot.\nPCI NICs sometimes require a cable connection to the power supply in order to stay awake when the computer is off/asleep. Check your manual to see if yours does and install if necessary\nEnabling WoL in the NIC\nFirst, determine which NIC will be used, and then check whether it supports the Magic Packet™ using\nsudo ethtool <NIC>\n\nwhere  is the device name of your NIC, e.g. eth0. This command will output some information about your the capabilities of your NIC. If this output contains a line similar to the following:\nSupports Wake-on: <letters>\n\nwhere  contains the letter g, the NIC should support the WoL Magic Packet™ method (for the other letters look at man ethtool).\nEnabling WoL in the NIC\nTo check whether WoL is enabled in the NIC, one could use\nsudo ethtool <NIC>\n\nand look for\nWake-on: <letters>\n\nIf  contains g and not d, then Magic Packet™ is enabled. However, if  does contain d, WoL needs to be enabled by running the following command:\nsudo ethtool -s <NIC> wol g\n\nOn most systems, issuing this command is required after each boot. If the system's networking is configured via ifupdown, then it is easy to add the line up ethtool -s  wol g below the interface's configuration stanza in /etc/network/interfaces. For example:\nshahar@shahar-backup:~$ cat /etc/network/interfaces\n\n# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system\n# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).\n# The loopback network interface\n\nauto lo iface lo inet loopback\n# The primary network interface\n\nauto eth0 iface eth0 inet static\n        address 10.0.0.1\n        netmask 255.255.255.0\n        gateway 10.0.0.138\n        up ethtool -s eth0 wol g\n\nThis will ensure that WoL is enabled in the NIC on each boot. Fore more information see the interfaces manual.\nSources blog from raymond.cc & Ubuntu help\n\nTools to help set this up, configure and/or use:\n\n*\n\n*etherwake (command line)\n\n*wakeonlan (command line)\n\n*powernap (command line)\n\n*gwakeonlan (gui)\n\ngWakeOnLan\nInstallation: sudo apt-get install gwakeonlan or click this button\n\n\n\nImages from ubuntugeek and that site also has a summary:\nRequirements to allow gWakeOnLan to turn on a machine all these requirements must be met.\nEach machine to turn on must:\n\n*\n\n*have an integrated (or PCI/PCIE) Ethernet network card.\n\n*have the network cable plugged all the time.\n\n*have the power cable plugged all the time.\n\n*support the Wake On LAN with the Magic Packet.\n\n*have the Wake On LAN enabled in the BIOS.\n\n*have the Wake On LAN by Magic Packet enabled in the Operating System.\n\n*be powered off from the Operating System.\n\nIf one or more of these requirements is not met all the time, the Wake On LAN will not work.\n\nA: First install an ssh server on the remote machine you want to access:\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server \n\nYou will also need to install a program to download stuff, if it is not already installed:\nsudo apt-get install wget\n\nGet another machine on the same network, running Ubuntu, and try sshing into the remote machine\nssh USERNAME@IP_ADDRESS\n\nYou can also 'ssh' from Windows, Mac etc, but you can find out how to do that of the internet - sorry.\nThe USERNAME entry is your username on that computer - you should see it when you open terminal, before the @.

First set up port forwarding on your router . This means that any request sent to the router will be diverted to your machine.

I have been to\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessCardsSupported\nOne thing I found, is that many of the wireless USB receivers (especially produced after 2008 -- and thus the ones I can find at stores) require ndiswrapper.  However, I get the Fatal: Module Not Found error when trying to use ndiswrapper.  The fix for this is to install all the packages needed for dkms, and install this way.  However, this requires gcc, and a decent chain of dependencies -- some of which are unsatisfiable because of dependency issues in version numbers between the installed system and (I copied the .deb files to a thumb drive at a friend's place and tried to install them with dpkg).  \nI also found that, annoyingly, the naming of the wireless cards is a bit misleading.

However, in the store (Best-Buy), looking at the box, there is only the number WNDA3100 on the back of the box.  It wasn't until I got home, and tried it until I realized (via lsusb) that it is WDNA3100 V2.  And it doesn't work.  In fact it is another one that works only with ndiswrapper, and even at that, doesn't work very well apparently.  \nSo I have tried pretty much every card at Best-Buy now.  None of them work.

Both .IptabLes and .IptabLex were connected to IP addresses that belonged to China Telecom.\nThis was a shock to me because I had the iptables firewall software configured so it would only allow connections to the web server on port 80 and ssh on port 22 was limited to a static IP I use at home so I can access the server remotely.\nI killed the processes, removed the files from the /boot directory and also found copies in the root and in /usr which I removed.

I have procrastinated this question a lot because I know it is a complex and a \"crossover\". That's why I have hesitated if to ask it here, on Ask Ubuntu, or somewhere else, let's say, Freelancer or Workspace. But, I have decided in the end, I need technical solutions to my socio-professional problems.\nSo, let's get to the point. I've been working as an online shop administrator for my former boss. But, till now I was paid only with praises and thanks. When I have explicitly asked for my money, I was asked to give detailed \"proofs\" of my work. Giving the fact that, at the beginning of our collaboration, my ex-boss told me that he knows everything I do online, I find it very weird to be asked right now for \"proofs\". So, I believe now this is only one of his tactics to delay my payment or even to discourage me. \nAnyway, luckily, I had the inspiration to install Ubuntu One and to synchronise my work folder. So, theoretically, I have most of my \"evidence\" online and I can send him the link to see it. But here is the hard part, and here I need your answer and advice.\nI am new in this Linux world and I had a lot of headache to make Ubuntu One work (and I still can't make the right-click menu work all the time).

If so, how can I fix this? I mean that, long after synchronising (or directly uploading) a file/folder, I saw a message in the right-top part of the screen saying something like that \"file blablah.jpg it is uploaded\". How can taht be? I mean, if I synchronise file blablah.jpg on 1 September, how can I see the message about its synchronisation on 5 or 10 or 12 September? Shouldn't it happen instantly? How does it affects the date shown online? I need the read time dates to be shown, in order to convince my boss that my work was real. (And if I can't convince him, I need to convince the authorities if it is necessarily to go my issue further). \n\n*What other security advices can you give me related to Ubuntu One?\n\n\nPlease, excuse the complexity of my question, but I really need an answer so I can then answer to my ex-boss.

This applies to most any software in the release.\n12.04 LTS is a long term supported release, for up to 5 years for server.  This does not mean that the specific versions of software included in 12.04 will continue to exist afterwards in later releases.\nAfter 12.04 reaches End of Life, there is absolutely no guarantee that the versions of any given software in 12.04 will exist or be supported in later releases.  It is very likely that the software that you will want will already have been version bumped to later releases, depending on the version in Debian at the time of the later release of Ubuntu being made.\nDuring the lifespan of the LTS, however, the versions of the software in the LTS release are likely to stay the same, given the restrictions for version bumps in releases of Ubuntu.\n\nThis section answers the original question about PHP 5.3 and whether it'll be supported after 12.04 EOLs.\nAs long as 12.04 is not End of Life, it'll have PHP 5.3.\nHowever, as 12.10 (Quantal) and later all have PHP 5.4.x or newer, and everything else after will have that depending on what is in Debian and what PHP upstream has released, after 12.04, there is no PHP 5.3 available in the repositories, however it might be available in a PPA.  And that will likely be riddled with security bugs that are not fixed by the time 12.04 EOLs.\nIf you were too lazy to read all that, the answer to your question is, \"No, there's no guarantee that PHP 5.3 will be available after 12.04's End of Life\".  It will be VERY likely that by the time 12.04 EOLs, not even PHP upstream will support 5.3.x anymore, and we might be on PHP 5.5.x as stable and PHP 5.4.x as legacy.\n", "Q: amule Ed2k link for ubuntu releases? Why there is not any Ed2k link to download Ubuntu.ISO image in Ubuntu.com? I Know that there is other programs like Torrent, jidgo etc. Amule is another one why not? \n\nA: By \"etc.\" you're probably thinking of zsync. (There are also .metalink files but those are for automatic web download mirror selection.)\nWhy isn't ed2k supported as a primary distribution method for Ubuntu, alongside the other methods? This is probably because the eDonkey network:\n\n\n*\n\n*is considerably less popular than bittorrent. The more people use a peer-to-peer distribution method, the more effective it tends to be in assuring high speed and reliability.\n\n*does not offer the unique, highly specialized advantages that motivate some developers and users to use jigdo to construct server ISO images (jigdo does not support the usual desktop ISOs).\n\n*does not offer the HTTP compatibility/integration of zsync or its ability to facilitate selective downloading of missing pieces of an ISO, even for desktop ISO images.\n\n\nI believe the two most popular ways Ubuntu is downloaded are:\n\n\n*\n\n*traditional download (HTTP and, to a lesser extent, FTP)\n\n*bittorrent\n\n\nDownloading with a web browser (or ftp client) or with bittorrent are far more popular, among computer users at large, than any of the other distribution methods discussed above. It's no surprise that if only one standard peer-to-peer system is to be supported, it is bittorrent.\nIf you believe ed2k ought to be supported and are able and willing to present a compact, well-reasoned argument for this--to succeed, I think you'd most likely have to look up usage statistics to informally demonstrate that there users of EDonkey network clients who might be interested in downloading Ubuntu in that way--then you might consider filing a feature request against the ubuntu-website project on Launchpad.\nOn the other hand, if your goal is just to personally download Ubuntu with aMule, you might be able to do that, if you can find users on the EDonkey network (or other networks supported by the aMule client) who are sharing the ISO image you want. Especially if you download Ubuntu in this way, I highly recommend you verify its hash to ensure authenticity and integrity. If security is a concern, an MD5SUM is far better than nothing but a SHA-1 or SHA-2 hash is preferable.

They worked well, I could switch  them with the quirky Super+Space combination, but up until the point I tried to run Unity alongside Gnome. Mind you, it worked (kind of) - I got the Unity dock etc, but only on the root account. \nBut then I changed my mind. I didn't want Unity, after all. I uninstalled it by typing sudo apt-get remove --purge unity and sudo apt-get remove --purge ubuntu-desktop, which, as I have later found out, uninstalled Nautilus and other useful things. I had to do a lot of rebooting and reconfiguring (so much that I can't remember) to make things work again, and when I needed the Russian keyboard, I found out that I couldn't change to it. I can assure you, I have tried everything in the Keyboard Settings, and I followed a few Ask Ubuntu threads - here and here.\nAll of this didn't help me. I also tried editing the /etc/default/keyboard file, but that didn't help either. Now I'm stuck with the English default keyboard, even if I try to remove it through the Keyboard Settings GUI and change it to Russian, I still type in latin alphabet.\nP.S. I later found out that changing keyboard layouts works if I login as root, and that changing the system language to Russian works too, but does not affect my keyboard setup.\n\nA: After spending a very long day and a half trying to figure out why my keyboard layouts wouldn't switch from English (UK) to Russian on my main user account, I found the solution - I ran this command which I found on another askubuntu answer topic - \nsetxkbmap -option grp:alt_shift_toggle gb,ru\nWhere the gb and ru are the languages, and the alt_shift_toggle is the key combination to change the languages. However, because I have applied this sort of a hack, it means that the keyboard settings which I set via the GUI did not update and will remain in a \"broken\" state (at least that's how it is for me)...\nUpdate: After logging out and logging back in, I found that my changes did not stay, and that I had to carry out that command again to be able to use both of the keyboard layouts...\n\nA: Install TweakTool:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\nTweak Tool → Typing → Switching to another layout\n", "Q: Android SDK manager not opening I downloaded and installed the Android SDK ADT Bundle from the official website.

I know the basics for designing icons but I have no idea how to configure and compile them into a file so that I can create a gnome icon theme out of them. Can anyone help? It would be much appreciated :) Or maybe even link me to a tutorial that explains the basics. \n\nA: By the way, you may be interested in GNOME Look, where usually they just give an archive full of icons and go 'try and install this'    ;-)\nThe existing files for the icons themes are located in /usr/share/icons.\nOne of the easier ways of doing this would be to repackage a .deb file. So if you were to download a base one, like the one for the gnome-icon theme, you could then modify it as detailed here.\nYou first need to extract the deb file in terminal, make & change to the directory you want to extract it to:\nmkdir icondev\ncd icondev\n\nThen extract the deb file:\nar x /PATH/TO/PACKAGE.deb\n\nThis will extract the following files:\ndebian-binary control.tar.gz data.tar.gz\n\nAnd make your modifactions. Make sure you change the package name (in control.tar.gz, in control), and where it will install to (in data.tar.gz, anything inside that), or it will conflict with already installed or future installs of software.\nThe icon theme will work as long as it inside the /usr/share/icons folder, and in the same format as other icon themes. The name of the theme is the name of its folder within /usr/share/icons, and what is in the icon.theme file.\nYou can then repackage it with this - use this command EXACTLY:\nar r NEW-PACKAGE.deb debian-binary control.tar.gz data.tar.gz\n\nThen you can cross you fingers and install it with (this should detail any conflicts):\nsudo dpkg -i /PATH/TO/NEW-PACKAGE.deb\n\nYou should be able to remove it with:\nsudo apt-get remove NEW-PACKAGE-NAME\n\n", "Q: Problems installing Libre Office 4.1 - tar.gz I've downloaded Libre Office 4.1 for my Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, then opened the tar.gx file and clicked on install and then get this:\nThere was a problem opening the file /home/fmfalcao/.cache/.f…4.2_Linux_x86_rpm/install\n\nAny reason why?\nI've just installed the chrome browser without difficulty and and older version of Libre Office is already on my machine- I just wanted the newer package.\n\nA: You are trying to install an rpm package.

I got to thinking how much I would like to revive my skills in PASCAL/C++ and use the techniques in the books. About 4 years ago, I bought a distribution of UBUNTU on DVD and successfully loaded it. I could never find any mention of how to do any development even though the literature seemed to imply that UBUNTU included these compilers. I gave up on this but recently decided to try again. What is the best way to do software developmemnt on UBUNTU?\n\nA: I don't know much about Pascal on Ubuntu (or anywhere for that matter) but I use the Eclipse IDE for Java development so would probably go with Eclipse and the CDT (C/C++ Developers Toolkit) although Monodevelop is another option.\nhttp://www.eclipse.org/cdt/downloads.php\n\nA: It will be more easy for developer to use Synaptic package manager instead of Software Center which is prepared for general users. So you could search for *-dev libs, *-doc, IDE's...\nsudo apt-get install synaptic\n\nIt up to you, but I suggest start testing IDE's then move to learn the underlaying CLI compilers and the development helpers (like: auto-tools, packaging...).\n\n\n*\n\n*PASCAL (free pascal IDE's): lazarus, fp-ide\nFor user graphic interface development, you gonna see some difference then (Windows) in Linux most are using GTK libraries.\n\n*FORTRAN (no IDE): gfortran (Fortran95 compiler)\nUsing Gedit menu: View → Highlight Mode → Select: Fortran95\n\n*C++ (There plenty of IDE's, Compilers, Editors..)\ng++ is the gnu c++ compiler (gcc c compiler)\nGeany is very simple IDE or editor. If you want very simple one like old style, Write-Compile-Run. (Most editors in Linux support code highlighting, You can use most of them)\nEclipse with CDT plug-in is an advanced IDE\nOther IDE's: qtcreator (Qt GUI), netbean, anjuta (GTK+ GUI), codeblocks (wxWidget GUI), codelite, monodevelop (.NET, GTK GUI)..\nNote:\nPackage names end with -dev are development headers & libraries, with -doc are documentations, most are development doc's, shares system libraries (dynamic) start or end with lib\nYou can even install all, try them for sometime and see what the best for you.\nUpdate:\nConcerning Ubuntu development (Debian Based) mainly: c, c++ & python\nOther languages which have very good support: java, perl, ruby, vala, c#, lua, lisp, ...\n", "Q: How can I disable scrolling between windows if my mouse is in the xfce panel?

I saw there is a solution called pacemaker or high availibility.\nIs there a way to make it so the second server has the same exact data and is synced with all the data on the first one so that if the first one goes out the second server has everything the first one had?\nIs there a way to do it with just two servers and no other hardware?\n\nA: Yes. We have something called DRBD; Distributed Replicated Block Device. It is sort of a RAID1 mirroring between two computers, so that whenever something is written to the disk of Server1, the same data is written to the disk of Server2, either synchronously or asynchronously. That's the data part. \nFor simple cases, this should suffice. It's not difficult to get it up and running. Give it a go in a couple of VMs until you're comfortable. Then you might want to read up on other things to handle service failover. You'll need some way to make the secondary act as primary if the primary fails. Or you can use a primary-primary solution, but that requires special filesystems and you'll want a direct connection between the servers. \nThis document from the official Ubuntu Server documentation should get you started on DRBD: https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/drbd.html.

I have been trying to get AMR files, which is the default format of Evernote, to play in Firefox. If I download an AMR file to my computer, it plays fine with Totem (which I think is now called Videos...?) But AMR files do not play when embedded in a web site. At least not on the Evernote web site.\nAt first, my install of Firefox defaulted to trying to use VLC to play AMR files, but they would not play. So I tried to switch my plugin preference to Totem. There was no automatic Totem option, so I selected to open the files with /usr/bin/totem. Despite setting it that way, Firefox still insisted on opening with VLC. Eventually, I had to completely remove the VLC Mozilla plug in with Synaptic. Having done that, this is what I see when I open an audio file on the Evernote web site:\n\nAnnoyingly, there is nowhere to click, nothing to do so that I can select a plugin.\nIn the Preferences, I have selected to use Totem:\n\n... but this is having no effect.\nI tried just making it so that AMR files download:\n\n... but that didn't change anything either. I still get the plugin error graphic above.\nThe only way I can play AMR files from Evernote is to go through a tedious process of viewing the source of the frame within the web page and text searching for the AMR extension and then copying and pasting that to a new window... that process is obviously too inefficient for dealing with many audio files.\nI may just drop Evernote completely if the audio is going to be this much of a hassle.\nNonetheless, the real question here is, why is Firefox not respecting my selections for how to handle these files? Regardless of whether or not the VLC or Totem plugins can handle AMR files, if I say to download the files, that's what it should do, shouldn't it?\nUpdate: Here is an Evernote audio file that I shared so that people could test for themselves if they can get it to play.\n\nA: I tested the file. \nWith browser-plugin-vlc installed (sudo apt-get install browser-plugin-vlc) it plays without problem on my Lubuntu 13.10 but has a minor problem with Ubuntu 12.04. First you have to make sure that the plugin is allowed to execute by clicking on the \"LEGO-brick\" before the URL-bar. (For me it was allowed and I think it was for you too.) After this you will see the VLC-cone as the plugin loaded, but the controls are disabled on 12.04. You have to right-click on the VLC-cone and select Play. After this the plugin controls are no more disabled and the audio is played without problem. \nThe changes made in Firefox preferences for the preferred applications doesn't have any effect on embedded objects (that is the purpose of embedding) that is why it won't help in your case. From mozilla:\n\nAlso, when a plugin is available to handle a content type and you choose a different action for that type, Firefox will only take your chosen action when you access the type directly. For example, you may choose to open these files with a media player application instead of using the plugin that is set to open it. In such cases, your chosen application will be used for file downloads but, when the content type is embedded inside a web page, Firefox will continue to use the plugin to handle the content type. \n\nIf you still can't make it work by right clicking on the VLC-plugin then something is broken in your plugin. Unfortunately I don't know any browser plugins which explicitly support amr on Ubuntu, but it can still be made playable. In this case you will have to install the Force-Content Type firefox addon and change the amr content-type to e.g. mp3 which will trick firefox to load the Totem plugin for the file, which will have no problem opening the amr file although it doesn't explicitly support it.\n", "Q: I can't run applet on my firefox browser I am a new user in Ubuntu 13.10 , and I want to run an applet so,I installed Java Develop Kit 7u45 with netbeans 7.4 and I can run applet from netbeans but not from browser because of security setting.I search about my problem and I change my security setting to low and every thing remain with out an change help me please   \n\nA: Default settings of java control panel is \"High\".

You use ls -lrta ssh* in the /etc/ directory. That matches the ssh directory in that folder and then lists the contents of that directory. Those files what you see are actually in /etc/ssh/.\nAn ls -lrtad ssh* will not go down into the directory.\nAccess your files from the /etc/ssh/ directory.\n\nThe tricky thing here is that ls normally would put a header in such cases that those files are from which directory when you try an ls with a * on the command line. The problem is that the * is expanded by the shell to make the command line. E.g when you write ls py* and the directory have a python and python3 entry too, the shell will actually run this command: ls python python3 and the output will be something like:\npython:\ndebian_config\n\npython3:\ndebian_config\n\nBecause ls sees the multiple arguments it prints a header for each directory. So you can easily see that those files are from a different directories. But when there is only one match in the directory, like in your case, ls ssh* expands to ls ssh, then ls sees that you only put in one argument, so there is no need for the header, as you know what you are doing, and the output will be similar to yours.\n", "Q: How to do a clean package install after accidentally interrupting the build-essential package installation? I was installing the build essential package through command line using:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n\nAfter almost 4 minutes and reaching 87% completion, I mistakenly pressed Ctrl+Alt+F12 and a black screen appeared and I had to reboot.\nOn reboot, I removed all the files using apt-get remove build-essential and again tried to reinstall it.\nNow the package install takes only 5 seconds and prompts me with the message:\n0 upgraded, 1 newly installed, 0 to remove and 159 not upgraded.\n\nNeed to get 0 B/5,614 B of archives.\n\nAfter this operation, 37.9 kB of additional disk space will be used.\n\nSelecting previously unselected package build-essential.\n\n(Reading database ... 195397 files and directories currently installed.)\n\nUnpacking build-essential (from .../build-essential_11.6ubuntu5_i386.deb) ...\n\nSetting up build-essential (11.6ubuntu5) ...\n\nand the process was finished.\nI want to clean uninstall everything and go through the\ninstallation process of that 50MB again. What should I do?\n\nA: Black screen appears only because of  Ctrl+Alt+F12 and  not because of build-essential package.\nHow can you completely remove a package?\n\nA: Any downloaded packages will likely have been cached, which would speed up the second install dramatically. Plus the dependencies of build-essential which completed installing will not be automatically installed again.\ndpkg and apt are very robust tools and will very likely have coped fine with unexpected reboot. If you're really paranoid, however, you can use debsums to check the integrity of almost all installed packages (all those with checksums available) - you may need to install debsums, and you probably want to run it with -c or -s.) Also, \"dpkg -C\" and \"apt-get check\" will verify the general integrity of the installed package set.\n", "Q: How can I install PS3 joypad in wireless - bluetooth- mode (Steam compatible)?

So, why doesn't it work for me?\n(I have Ubuntu 12.04.4, g++ 4.6.3)\n\nA: This seems to be the result of a bug in the source code for the program (at least in the specific case you provided details on). But fortunately it is one that you can work around without too much trouble!\nSince this is a recurring issue and often happens when source code for a program tested on another platform (most often Windows) is brought to Ubuntu, we should probably consider this question on-topic even though it involves bugs and programming. With that said, reporting the bug to the program's developer is an appropriate action to take as well.\nIt appears that one of the following situations applies:\n\n\n*\n\n*On the platform(s) where the program was developed and tested, the header file(s) providing identifiers like strlen were indirectly included by being pulled in by the implementation of some other header file. This is unintentionally implementation-specific behavior.\n\n*Some weird C++ standard library implementations allow a lot of things that are technically prohibited and a few things that are conceptually impossible. (This does not make them bad overall, necessarily.) I believe some versions of Microsoft's C++ library give you functions like strlen as global identifiers even from C++-style #includes like #include <cstring>. This will not work with GCC/g++ on Ubuntu.\n\n\nIn either case, you will probably have to edit the source code slightly, as Null pointer suggested. Since this is quite simple, we can walk you through this if you tell us exactly what files you downloaded and what steps, if any, you took before running make. You can edit your question to include this information as well.\nNull pointer's advice to add something like #include <string.h> at the top of the files where the errors are happening will likely work. It may or may not be the best way to fix this. If situation 2 is what is happening, a using statement for the needed keywords (or the whole std namespace if necessary) would suffice.\n", "Q: Wine1.7 cannot be uninstalled completely I uninstalled Wine 1.7 by apt-get remove wine1.7.

The UBUNTU_MENUPROXY variable needs to be unset for eclipse to work correctly. You are setting it to eclipse and not launching any applications. \nThough I don't know if this solves your problem, since I think this shouldn't cause the icon not showing up, just it won't do anything when clicked.\n\nUPDATE: So the above haven't made eclipse to show up, here is one more thing you can try:\nPut the .desktop file in the ~/.local/share/applications/ directory, this is where you can store per-user .desktop files, maybe unity will detect it from there.

Or replace path_to_eclipse by eclipse and create a symbolic link to executable file pointed by the which command.) For example in your case, since the executable is /usr/share/eclipse.kepler/eclipse the .desktop file would look like this:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Eclipse\nIcon=eclipse\nExec=env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=/usr/share/eclipse.kepler/eclipse\nTerminal=false\nCategories=Development;IDE;Java;\n\nNow eclipse should appear in the menu.\n\nTo create a symbolic link use:\nsudo ln -s -T source_file target_file\n\nwhere you should replace source_file with the absolute path of eclipse and place the target_file i.e. the link in /usr/bin:\nsudo ln -s -T path_to_eclipse /usr/bin/eclipse\n\n\nA: I think that you are referring to Alacarte.

The I could use a bash script to start the ripping.\nBut that option isn't there anymore and I can only use programs?\nI'm trying some things with udev but I had little success\n/etc/udev/rules.d/10-srX_change.rules\nSUBSYSTEM==\"block\", KERNEL==\"sr0\", ENV{ID_CDROM_MEDIA_CD}==\"1\", RUN+=\"/home/user/morituri.sh\"\n\n\nA: There is a dialog in Details which will allow you to run an action on insert:\n\nBut it only allows you to select Applications. If Morituri is an application, it should work fine - just select it under Other Applications....\nIf it does not appear in the selection dialogue, you will have to create an Application launcher file for it. My solution to this would be to create a .desktop file for your script using:\nsudo nano /usr/share/applications/morituriCD.desktop\n\nwith the following contents (Copy ALL of it, and paste it with Ctrl+Shift+V):\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nName=Morituri CD program\nIcon=brasero\nExec=/home/USER/Morituri.sh\nTerminal=false\nCategories=AudioVideo;DiscBurning;\nMimeType=application/x-cd-image;application/x-cdrdao-toc;application/x-cue;application/x-toc;audio/x-scpls;audio/x-ms-asx;audio/x-mp3-playlist;audio/x-mpegurl;application/x-brasero;x-content/audio-cdda;x-content/video-dvd;x-content/video-vcd;x-content/video-svcd;x-content/image-picturecd;\nKeywords=morituri;disc;cdrom;dvd;burn;audio;video;\nNoDisplay=false\n\nSave with Ctrl+O\n, and exit with Ctrl+X\nMake sure that Exec= is linked to the correct path, and that the linked executable works. Make sure with:\nchmod +x /home/USER/morituri.sh\n/home/USER/morituri.sh\n\nYou should then get this:\n\nHope this helps ;-)\n"]
