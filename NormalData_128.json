["Q: Restoring Windows 7 with Ubuntu There are many Ubuntu-based operating systems that claim to restore windows. Can Ubuntu do this? I often need to repair my multi-booting computer, or to repairs other computers.\n\nA: You could try using boot-repair. It's explained here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair\n", "Q: How do I tell the installer what my home directory is? Could someone please tell me how to tell the installer what my home directory is?\n\nA: You can download the bsnes .deb package here: http://www.playdeb.net/software/bsnes\nIt contains the latest version for Ubuntu 10.10, 11.04. 11.10 and 12.04. Install the right one for your system.\n", "Q: Installing Wine with aptitude I'm trying to install Wine on Ubuntu Precise. I'm used to using aptitude for package management, so I tried to use that to install Wine. When I do that, I'm told I have to resolve dependencies that end up leaving me with 21 packages being uninstalled! However, when I try to install with apt-get, it appears to work fine.\nWhat's going on? Will it work right if I install Wine through apt-get? Will it break aptitude? Why is this happening?\n\nA: aptitude remembers which packages were explicitly requested and which were only installed due to dependencies. It will automatically uninstall packages which were not explicitly requested when they are no longer needed.\napt-get treats packages requested explicitly and their dependencies the same.\nSo better use aptitude, this helps to keep your system clean.\n\nA: The way I see it is that \"aptitude\" actually is running something of an equivalent of \"apt-get autoremove\" before downloading and installing wine. Its trying to remove dependencies first which it thinks is no longer in use but somehow its causing interference with installation of wine.\n\"apt-get\" on the other hand doesn't require this. It'll only remove dependencies which are not in use if you explicitly tell it by running \"apt-get autoremove\".\n\"aptitude\" no doubt is a bit feature rich than \"apt-get\", but if you get the desired result through \"apt-get\", I see no reason not to use it.\nAnd in my opinion, \"apt-get\" shouldn't break \"aptitude\". \n", "Q: Could I use my webcam as a barcode reader?

Is there any alternative to Magic Folder for ubuntu? Or can we make a folder which will allow us to easily categorize and move files.

You may need to install ecryptfs-utils first, if it is not already installed.\nThis will create a new folder called \"Private\" in your home directory as /home/USERNAME/Private. Anything you put inside (files, folders) will be transparently encrypted. You can use the default file viewer, Nautilus to copy and move files to and from Private folder. \nTo test you will need at least two user accounts, say user1 and user2. \nFirst, create the Private folder while logged in as user1.\nSecond, copy some files and folders inside the Private folder. While you are still logged in as user1 you can open, read and edit these folders and files.\nThird, logout from the user1 account and login as user2. Try to navigate to the User1's Private folder and verify that the files and folders inside are secure.\nWhen you log back in as user1 the encrypted folder \"Private\" will be automatically decrypted for you so that you can read and edit flies and folders inside \"Private\" again.\nSee the documentation and How to get a encrypted folder with passphrase for additional details.\n\nA: I suggest truecrypt \nfollowing this link :\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:michael-astrapi/ppa\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install truecrypt\n\n\nA: I am not aware of any application in Ubuntu that will do that for you. This can probably be implemented easily using Nautilus extension scripts. For example, right-click on a selected number of files and a context menu \"Categorize\" could invoke a shell script that parses filenames and filetypes, and moves them to pre-determined user directories.\nAs far as I know, someone needs to write this.\n", "Q: No external microphone Acer AO722 The ACER AO722 comes with an external mic input, and this input is not recognised by Alsa mixer or Sound (in System Settings). There are various comments on this problem, but no real solutions. For example External Mic not working but Internal Mic works on an Acer Aspiron AO722.\nUsing the internal mic is not an option, as I need to use skype professionally.\nI have tried everything in alsamixer (accessible through the Terminal Ctrl+Alt+t, command: alsamixer), and in Sound (under System Settings). I have also installed Pulseaudio. But to no avail.\nThe headset is working normally under Skype in Windows. My AO722 came with Windows 7 on it, so I have installed Skype there too. My headset has separate connectors for ears and mic, and these go into the respective output and input on the right side of the laptop.\nThis location: http://bernaerts.dyndns.org/linux/202-ubuntu-acer-ao722 sounds like an effective solution but it is for Ubuntu Natty 11.04. The solution suggested sounds drastic to me: replace the kernel 2.6.38-13 with version 2.6.38-12. I use Ubuntu 12.04, and my kernel is 3.2.0-30-generic-pae. Question: could I try this solution with Ubuntu 12.04? Is this a risky thing to do? \nI have found harware work around this problem. The audio output seems to be a combi output with also a microphone connection. I have made an adapter for this output. I used a 4 contacts 3,5 mm audio jack plug. To this plug I have soldered 2 female (common stereo) connectors, one for ears and one for the mic of my headset. The 4 contacts jack, which goes into the laptop (in audio OUTput) is wired as follows:\ntip = hot audio right; \nfirst sleeve after tip = hot audio left; \nsecond sleeve = common earth (for both ears and microphone); \nthe 3rd sleeve = microphone signal input.\nIn the connector which I could buy, the 3rd sleeve is not so much a sleeve, but part of the metal base of the connector; normally you would expect this one to be connect to earth. But connecting the mic signal to it works.\nMaybe ready made adapters of this kind and even headsets with a combi jack can simply be purchased; I didn't check.\nWhen I plug in the 4 contacts jack, Sound and Alsamixer immediately recognise an external microphone (even if no mic is connected to the adapter). In Sound, under the Input tab, 'Settings for internal microphone' changes into 'Setting for microphone'.\nThe microphone comes through loud and clear, however there is a constant noise in the background. Others have reported this too. If I disconnect the external mic from the adapter, or shortcircuit the external microphone, the noise gets less but does not disappear. Therefore, it is not background noise from the room, but it comes from the computer itself. However, if you talk directly in the microphone of the headset, the noise level is acceptable for VOIP.\nThe headset of my mobile phone Nokia C1 mobile comes wwith a 4 contacts combi 3,5mm jack plug. However, this one works (ear and mic) with the AO722 only if not inserted fully. Possibly the wiring of this headset jack is different.\nI cannot find detailed specs of the AO722, and don't know whether the audio 'output' was actually designed as a combi input/output. I have seen that at least one other AO model has a combi connector only. In any case, I do not believe that connecting your headset in this way will harm your computer.\nI would still appreciate a software solution. This must be possible, because the proper microphone input connector works under MS Windows.\n\nA: Once you have installed kernel 3.4 on 12.04, the sound card is fully recognised by default.\nThe only problem is that by default the internal microphone level is extremely low. It needs to be adjusted through a microphone boost device.\nSee Ubuntu 12.04 - Installation on Acer Aspire One 722 (AO722) - Nicolas Bernaerts\n\nA: First thing , I don't want to read so much \nI had the same experience that I couldn't detect my Microphone.\nIf that is not the problem please repost the problem in a very short unit.\nSimply go to sound preference \nchoose the duplex in the hardware setting menu.\nDone.\nNote: I forgot how was it , I did my best to reply to you , I am sure you will find what you have to .\n\nA: Yeah I have this issue too. \nSo I have found out how to work around it but not really a solution either. My guess removing pulseaudio will fix it but....  I don't want to do that. \nMy work around for now\n1. Go to sound settings, then to input. You need to be able to see the microphone volume when, if it starts to work. \n2. Now in a with the command line type alsamixer and press f4, if any of the microphone levels are low raise them \n3. Notice that some of the levels say capture, using the spacebar toggle these around and after each check the other sound app if your microphone is working.\n** if that works, you might be able to exit out, run as root alsactl store,  to save the settings and then just run as root alsactl restore, set then back.  \nThis is a pain in the rear but it works for me. If seems to me that Pulseaudio is controlling the sound but not working properly with the microphone. \nGood luck\n\nA: while i could occasionally get an external mic to work by the method described by user28525 above i needed something more relyable for participating on short notice online-meetings.\nas i remembered having trouble with some mainline-kernels before (missing ubuntu-specific drivers or breaking other driver such as those provided by nvidia) i didn't really want to go down the path of jakars solution either.\nluckily, i've found another helpful answer mentioning fully backported kernels for ubuntu-12.04-lts of which the latest is 3.8 (raring ringtail) and that just proved to work flawless so far as the input is switched automatically from internal mic to external mic as soon as i insert the jack.\nthe sound-settings input-tab dialogue then also switches from internal microphone to microphone.\nthe packages needed to install are linux-image-generic-lts-raring and linux-headers-generic-lts-raring and should be available in the standard ubuntu 12.04 repositories.\n", "Q: After formatting Windows 7 there is still dual-boot screen I have installed Windows 7 and Ubuntu 11.10 on my PC and Ubuntu was installed using WUBI installer. \nToday, I format my PC and installed Windows 7 and after restarting the PC, there is still displayed a dual-boot (Win 7 and Ubuntu) menu, but I do not have install Ubuntu. \nCan anyone tell me what is wrong and why is there still a dual-boot screen? How can remove this dual boot and install new version Ubuntu along Windows 7? Can anyone help me with this?\n\nA: Those entries are still showing because you installed Wubi (Ubuntu inside Windows) in a partition which you didn't format. As a result the Ubuntu boot information was at the root of the partition there (for example, if you installed in E:, the boot files are still in E:). Windows 7 scanned for other OSes  during installation and added Ubuntu in the list. (It is same as adding Windows XP). \n\nHow can remove this dual boot and instal new version ubuntu along win 7? Can anyone help me with these?\n\nI recommend removing the Ubuntu files at that partition, mainly ubuntu.disk and swap.disk file and then install Ubuntu via Wubi in the same old partition. Alternatively, You can just format that partition (You should backup your data first, if you have there) and install Ubuntu via Wubi there.\n", "Q: Do/will webapps work in Kubuntu 12.10? I hear web apps have landed in 12.10. I can't seem to get them to work in Kubuntu 12.10, however. Will they be coming to Kubuntu? Or did I just not set them up correctly? \n\nA: No, it's a feature of the Unity desktop; you'll only see this integration when running that.  (Which is why it says 'Unity Webapps' all over that article you linked. ;)  \nI don't know what KDE or Kubuntu might do in the future, but the new webapp integration code, that I know of, is largely Unity-specific.  It's code to make the Unity Launcher, the Unity Dash, Unity's alt-tab switcher, Unity indicators and notifications, aware of web sites.  When you visit sites from that growing list, in Firefox or Chromium, those parts of Unity can treat that website like a first-class citizen of the desktop.\nThis kind of integration may take off, and be built into more desktops in the future, but what you're reading about for 12.10 -- no, that's just Unity.\n", "Q: Installations: Passwords do not match Installation:\nDownloaded WUBI from Ubuntu site today; therefore, I presume this is the latest version of WUBI.

See Only 'sdb' shows up when installing 12.04 on a new Dell inspiron 14z.\nI am not sure why WUBI install didn't work at first. Changing the NTFS partition to ext4 was a mistake. WUBI install does not use the partition directly but uses a large file inside a Windows partition (NTFS). This is why one can use WUBI install without making any new partition. The installation will put the big file in C: by default. Since Windows cannot read/write ext4 (or any other Linux partition) WUBI cannot use these types of partitions. Remember WUBI installations is done from within Windows.\nSuggestion:\nFirst, Boot Windows and uninstall WUBI installation using Windows Uninstall feature. \n\n\n*\n\n*Boot from USB stick and select \"Try Ubuntu\"\n\n*Open a terminal by pressing\nCtrl+Alt+T and enter sudo dmraid\n-E -r /dev/sda.\n\n*Using Gparted delete the ext4 partition you had created before.

I'm stuck and at the end of my tiny little thread of knowledge about this process. \n\nA: Looking at the package, you need to have php5, mysql, and php5-mysql. You also need to have a webserver installed that can serve the pages in the package. Most people tend to use Apache, which can be installed with apache2. Don't forget that you will also need the PHP5 plugin for Apache, so Apache knows how to handle PHP files. You can install that with libapache2-mod-php5.\nBasically:\nsudo apt-get install php5 mysql-server php5-mysql apache2 libapache2-mod-php5 libapache2-mod-auth-mysql\n\nAfter that, you will need to setup Apache with the configuration that you would like it to run, such as where it should serve files from. I believe Apache2 defaults to using /var/www these days. You will also have to setup the PHP5 and MySQL extensions in Apache2.\nYou will also need PHPMyAdmin installed, unless you want to import the site.sql file manually. You can install PHPMyAdmin with:\nsudo apt-get install phpmyadmin\n\nIf you'd rather not install PHPMyAdmin, you can always just import the site.sql file through MySQL on the command line.

For x86_64 download the \"amd64\" files, for x86 download the \"i386\" files, for ARM download the \"armhf\" files. And for all architectures download the \"all\" file. Then put them in a folder, like in Downloads/kernel. Then from terminal go to that folder, like \"cd ~/Downloads/kernel\". Then run \"sudo dpkg -i linux-*.deb\", enter password when prompted.

I don't know which one to choose. The default choice is Ubuntu, but what's different about the other ones?\n\n\n*\n\n*ubuntu has different FLAVORS http://www.ubuntu.com/project/about-ubuntu/derivatives if you are just beginning i'll recommend default Ubuntu. \n\n*within ubuntu itself you can decide to use different desktop environment or interfaces, the two most popular ones right now are Gnome Shell and Unity (subjective opinion) you can read more about them here http://lifehacker.com/5853099/linux-desktop-faceoff-gnome-3-vs-ubuntu-unity.  I'll also recommend the default Unity one, just because anything default will give you more documentation. \nUbuntu is getting ready to launch 12.10, the current stable version is 12.04. Here are few things you might expect in the new release. \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3IpXE2bYv0 \n\nA: I have been using Ubuntu for a week now, converted from W7 myself.\nI used the Windows Installer and it worked perfectly. \nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/install-ubuntu-with-windows\nI gave Ubuntu 15 GB and chose Ubuntu as default desktop enviroment. Don't worry, you can change desktop later if you want to try something else. \nUbuntu has alot of online support help like askubuntu and many others, don't be afraid to use them. Forums, youtubers and websites are dedicated to see us newbies through the first weeks :) \n\nA: Welcome to Linux!  We're happy you're here!  I was a long-time Windows user until about a year-and-a-half ago, when I did what you're doing, partly out of a bit of frustration with Windows but largely because I was just curious.  I figured I might as well see what it was like on the other side of the fence.  Now I still have a Windows partition that I keep just because, but I almost never boot into it: I'm all Ubuntu now.\nSo to answer your questions, it looks like you have plenty of room on your HD.  You won't use as much space with Linux as with Windows, but if you end up staying with Linux you'll want more space eventually where you can save pictures, music, etc., so I'd recommend going with about 30 GB (as kmassada also recommended).  It'll give you plenty of room for messing around and learning - which is one of the fun things about Linux.\nBut you might want to keep some of the rest of the space clear for now, because you might get the desire along the way to install and test other flavors of Linux.  Hey, they're free, right?  Why not try them out?  A free 20 or 30 GB of space would let you easily try something else out.  (In my year-and-a-half, I've tried out lots and lots of distros, including all of the popular ones; I'm still with Ubuntu, but I'm glad I looked at the others, too.)  So if you give about 30 GB to Ubuntu, you'll still have almost twice that space left for trying out other distros.  (And when you're done testing one, if you want to get rid of it you can just delete the partition.)\nAs for the desktop environment, well that's pretty subjective.  I really like Unity but I know others prefer different DEs.  One good way to test some of the others is to install a distro that comes with another DE (try Kubuntu, for example, in another partition, to experience KDE, or Xubuntu or Lubuntu to try some of the lightweight DEs).  You can easily try Cinnamon or Mint with Ubuntu, installing them and then logging into them.  And you'll want to check out Gnome, too.  As you read more and learn more about Linux, you'll encounter a lot of things about them all - and even a few irrational rants.\n\nA: Do not be afraid of multi booting.  Every distro I have used for about 10 years now makes this easy.  Just know what is on all your partitions so you don't overwrite the wrong one. Also if you want to try several distros side by side I would recommend GAG.  \n18GB is more than enough space for Linux.  The question is how much stuff will you want to add.  Not enough for a movie library but plenty for checking email and surfing.\nDesktop Environment... try them all.  I have found the hardest part of using Linux is the amount of choices.  Every time I want to do something I have to start googling and comparing different apps (music players, video players, text editors, email,  file managers, on and on).  So filter your options through your requirements and just try them until you find something you are comfortable with.  \nI know that's not helpful so here is a comparison you might have already seen.  \nHave fun!  And I always tell windows user to enjoy the huge repository of free applications.  Synaptic is your friend.\n", "Q: How to record \"stereo mix\" with VLC? I would like to record a stereo mix (basically what I hear through the speakers connected to my sound card) from VLC. However, I haven't been able to figure out exactly how to do this.\nUnder the \"video4linux\" capture device, I see the following audio devices:\nhw:0,0\nhw:0,6\n\nHowever, selecting either of those results in VLC trying to use my webcam (not what I want at all) in addition to the selected audio device.\nWhat do I need to do?\n\nA: I don't know about VLC, but you should be able to record in audacity. You'll need to install the pavucontrol package, and set Audacity's recording device to the loopback device in the sound preferences, and the application you're trying to record from, to the loopback device for its output. You'll also need to record the audio into a stereo track in Audacity. This is of course an internal loopback system, and the audio won't be output to the speakers as well.\n\nA: yes you can use VLC.  i just figured out exactly how.  first off make sure your stereo mix is enabled (within your system's sound settings).  Then, in VLC, go to media, then open capture device.  select none for video, then select stereo mix for sound.  then press play and make sure to mute the sound on VLC or else you will have a reverbish loop with the original sound plus VLC playing the same sound with a delay.  then simply press record to begin recording.\n", "Q: Install oracle-java7-installer through apt-cacher-ng I've added the oracle-java7-installer ppa to my apt-cacher-ng server and to my clients.

Specifically if Acquire::http::Proxy::download.oracle.com returns DIRECT to determine whether to use the default proxy of to download directly.\nSpecifically the install runs\n# use apt proxy\nAPT_PROXIES=$(apt-config shell \\\nhttp_proxy Acquire::http::Proxy \\\nhttps_proxy Acquire::https::Proxy \\\nftp_proxy Acquire::ftp::Proxy \\\ndl_direct Acquire::http::Proxy::download.oracle.com \\\n)\n\nAnd later on\nif [ \"$dl_direct\" = \"DIRECT\" ]; then\n    unset http_proxy\n    unset https_proxy\n    unset ftp_proxy\nfi\n\nIf you use the following apt config then the installer with download directly:\nAcquire::http::Proxy \"http://my.proxy.com:3142\";\nAcquire::http::Proxy {\n        download.oracle.com DIRECT;\n};\n\nWhile this works it is somewhat annoying as the download takes forever and that somewhat defeats the purpose of the proxy. \nI found that the installer checks a debconf variable to check whether to use a local file. The property checked is oracle-java8-installer/local and it is a string.\nSpecifically the installer runs:\ndb_get oracle-java8-installer/local\nif [ -d \"$RET\" -a -f \"$RET\"/$FILENAME ]; then\n\n    echo \"Installing from local file $RET/$FILENAME\"\n    cp -f -p \"$RET\"/$FILENAME ${FILENAME}_TEMP\n    mv -f ${FILENAME}_TEMP $FILENAME\nelse # no local file\n\nSo if you have the JDK downloaded and in a directory /jdk/dir then you need to run the following command before running the installer:\nsudo debconf-set-selections <<< 'debconf oracle-java8-installer/local string /jdk/dir/'\n\nNote the trailing / on the directory - this is required.\n\nA: I ran against the same issue, but managed to find a workaround. The main issue is that apt-cacher-ng does not forward any custom HTTP headers, as used by the Oracle installer (wget) to accept the Oracle license. \nI've made the following changes to my acng.conf file. I've enabled and extended the PfilePattern clause as suggested by GomoX:\nPfilePattern = .*(\\.d?deb|\\.rpm|\\.drpm|\\.dsc|\\.tar(\\.gz|\\.bz2|\\.lzma|\\.xz)(\\.gpg|\\?AuthParam=.*)?|\\.diff(\\.gz|\\.bz2|\\.lzma|\\.xz)|\\.jigdo|\\.template|changelog|copyright|\\.udeb|\\.debdelta|\\.diff/.*\\.gz|(Devel)?ReleaseAnnouncement(\\?.*)?|[a-f0-9]+-(susedata|updateinfo|primary|deltainfo).xml.gz|fonts/(final/)?[a-z]+32.exe(\\?download.*)?|/dists/.*/installer-[^/]+/[0-9][^/]+/images/.*)$\n\nand added (this is the important part):\nRequestAppendix: Cookie: oraclelicense=a\n\nThis will cause acng to send a HTTP cookie with each and every request, but at least makes the oracle binaries pass through and make the installation complete successfully. \nTested this with some local Docker images and they download and install Java almost instantaneously!\nFWIW: I've created a bug report for acng (#314773, unfortunately not public), so hopefully it will be fixed in an upcoming release...\nedit 1: Further testing turned out that it works on Debian Jessie , but not (yet) on Ubuntu Utopic (14:10)...\nedit 2: It now also works in Ubuntu Utopic (problem was that I used a Docker image without the ca-certificates package installed).\n\nA: apt-cacher-ng has a very restrictive URL regex that only allows for some types of packages to be downloaded. The Java package from Oracle doesn't match it. The solution is modifying the config where the regex is defined. \nIn particular the URL of the package is something like yada-yada.tar.gz?AuthParam=abcdacbd_123123123123, so we have to adjust in consequence.\nBasically:\n\n\n*\n\n*In /etc/apt-cacher-ng/acng.conf, uncomment the line beginning with PfilePattern\n\n*Modify it to replace \\.tar\\.gz with \\.tar\\.gz(\\?AuthParam=.*)?\nFor reference, the entire line in my config file is:\nPfilePattern = .*(\\.deb|\\.rpm|\\.dsc|\\.tar\\.gz\\.gpg|\\.tar\\.gz(\\?AuthParam=.*)?|\\.diff\\.gz|\\.diff\\.bz2|\\.jigdo|\\.template|changelog|copyright|\\.udeb|\\.diff/.*\\.gz|vmlinuz|initrd\\.gz|(Devel)?ReleaseAnnouncement(\\\\?.*)?)$\n\nA: You can use the DIRECT option in the apt preferences to avoid passing through the proxy for the Java packages from Oracle. This is not a perfect solution but should allow your users to install the packages at the expense of extra traffic.\nThe configuration snippet (for the client computers, not the apt-cacher-ng server) is:\nAcquire::http::Proxy {\n    *.oracle.com DIRECT;\n};\n\nYou can put this into a /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99proxy file to make sure it overrides any previous apt proxy configuration.\n\nA: First you need to remove openjdk for this run the following command from your terminal:\nsudo apt-get purge openjdk*\nIf you installed java 7 from any other PPA and you are having problem with java then you have to do following steps before installing the PPA mentioned here:\nsudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/info/oracle-java7-installer*\nsudo apt-get purge oracle-java7-installer*\nsudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*java*\nsudo apt-get update\n\nInstall oracle java 7 in ubuntu 13.04/12.10/12.04\nOpen the terminal and run the following commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer\n\nYou can check the java version by searching java in dashboard.\n", "Q: how to access windows 7 partition files? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to access Windows partition? \n\nIn previous Ubuntu versions I installed Ubuntu and it always recognized the windows partition.\nI installed Ubuntu 12.04.01 LTS and I stoped to see the windows partition.\nhow to access windows 7 partition files inside Ubuntu?

And when I log in, or perhaps even earlier, I want my dual monitors to be set up properly using a script that runs xrandr(that I already have working). Everyone I talk to or whose questions I read online talk about xinitrc, ~/.xsession or /etc/X11/xsession, but none of these files are being run. The files in /usr/share/xsesssions seem to be the only files that are being run, and I cannot for the life of me find any documentation about any of this.\nWhere is the consistency in this system? What, exactly, am I supposed to do if I want to do this properly? Some window managers seem to do this(KDE and gnome seem to have something just called 'autostart'). Am I supposed to let my window manager handle this, X, or lightdm? \nI understand there are probably dozens of files in the startup process that I could possibly put this in, but I'm asking for the proper convention. What is the solution, for something like this? \nTL;DR; Is there one, consistent way for me to run a script automatically for every window manager that runs on top of X, or does this depend entirely upon the combination of window managers and login managers I am using?\n\nA: Many thanks for the \"What happens under the cover...\" link, a must read !\n~/.xprofile happens too early, the xrandr settings are lost.\nOne solution is to create a script and execute it in the \"applications on startup\".\nThough, since nautilus is already launched and it will decide to display the icons on the secondary monitor (after the xrandr command), I added at the end :\nkillall -1 nautilus\nnautilus -n\n\nDirty but works. Hope this helps.\n\nA: I believe you may find this will work for you. It will be sourced by dash script /usr/sbin/lightdm-session which will later execute the exec for the window manager.\nAssuming that this is just for you, and because it is related to X, I'd suggest putting it into ~/.xprofile. If it will apply to every user of the system, /etc/xprofile may be more appropriate.\nCreate a file ~/.xprofile and edit it to contain something your xrandr command (similar to the following test item):\n\nxrandr --output LVDS --mode 1280x854\n\nYou can find more information at What happens under the covers to log me in and start up Unity or another Graphical User Interface?.

Hardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel i7\n\n*AMD Radeon HD 6970\n\n*SSD with plenty of space\n\n*6 GB RAM\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\n*\n\n*OpenJDK 6, 7, and Oracle Java 7 (reproducible with all three)\n\n*AMD Catalyst 12.8 and open source driver (reproducible with both)\n\n*Ubuntu 12.04 x86_64 and older\n\n*Minecraft 1.3.2 vanilla and older\n\n\nOn this setup I am getting rubbish frame rates after a short while of playing, dropping from about 45-55 to 15 in a couple of minutes. CPU use is 40-45 even when rendering the opening screen at 1920x1280, and gameRenderer is using about 90% CPU when playing.\nRather than trying to eke out a few more FPS out of an obviously broken rendering pipeline, I really hope to find a solution to make the GPU render Minecraft.\nEdit 1: Something bizarre just happened: The first thing I always change in the settings is to turn bobbing off. Turns out that re-enabling bobbing makes the frame rate shoot right back up from 15-20 to 30-50 (mostly around 30) in fullscreen mode! It is still rather erratic, bumping down to 15-20 sometimes, but usually only for a few seconds.  Also, the debug mode (F3) shows that 100% of the time is spent in \"unspecified\".\nEdit 2: That seems to have been a dud - I disabled bobbing again a few minutes later, and it's been running at 20-40 FPS since. The snooper reports 24 FPS.\n\nA: Check the amount of memory allocated allotted for mc to use; if its running in 32 bit mode it will only show max 2 or 3gb, if 64 bit mode how ever much memory you have - 1gb will be shown (option is only available in the launcher).\nIf your running a mod pack 4 gb is the max you will need. If its running 32 and you already have 64 then you have to uninstall 32 (there might be a fix,, I just don't know one). It is not sensible to run a 32 bit system with 6gb RAM + graphics.\n\nA: Uninstall Oracle Java. \nI had the same problem  (but with an even better GPU) and had the same Java installs, I removed Oracle and my fps shot up from 20fps to 200fps. 10 times better than before. \nOr you can right click on it and run with open JDK to see if it's the Java or the GPU.\nAlso use the catalyst driver modules for your graphic card.\n\nA: Minecraft doesn't use the GPU for most of its calculations, instead relying solely on the CPU. This results in some pretty trash performance. But, since these calculations are hard coded into the game, there really is no way to change them, and completely change the component that the game is run on. Doing so would require them to rewrite the entire game.\n", "Q: I need help installing my dlink dwa-160 usb adapter on ubuntu 12.04.1?

(Edit - Files lost - urgent help needed) Sometime back I bought a second PC to serve as my backup machine, but I've never managed to have it as I would like. Now I want to start over, but I've messed so much with it's disks that I'm kinda afraid to lose something on the way, thus this question.\nRight now, I have a 1TB disk partitioned like this (as per GParted):\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda1 (ext4) 346.12Gb -> Is almost full, has an old install of Ubuntu 11.10. It no longer boots, ever since i installed Windows7 on /sda3. Everything that matters to me is tucked into /var/www/ all the rest can just go.\n\n*/dev/sda2 (ext4) 196.45Gb -> has an old install of 12.04 and nothing important, it's pretty much empty and also doesn't boot.\n\n*/dev/sda3 (ntfs) 377.97Gb -> is my boot partition with Windows 7, some important files and I'd like to keep it untouched.\n\n*/dev/sda4 (extended) 10.97Gb -> was created when i first installed Ubuntu, i think.\n\n\nIn my ideal world, I'd like to safely reinstall Ubuntu from the 12.04 liveUSB and merge sda1 and sda2 without losing any files. Is that possible? How?\n\nDESPERATE UPDATE\nThings got really ugly right now. I tried for a few days to follow Marty's advice, but something is up. I did the first part, of wiping the second partition and enlarging the first. Then I couldn't get Super Grub Disk to work. Tried from the live USB, then tried to make a USB disk for it, and it wouldn't boot. So i let it cool and returned today to the system.\nTo my surprise, when i booted from the Live USB and ran Install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS the program recognized thw instalation of 11.10 and offered me an option to just update it without loosing any files. I went joyfully to it.\nAfter the update finished, booting didn't work, i got \"input not supported\" and booted back from the USB. Then i went to see if everything was OK, and for my desperation, i just can't find the /var/www folder where i had everything. Gparted also tells me the partition is now almost empty.\nI didn't do any sav operation on the HD after this and shut it down immediately to avoid any more damage. Now i really need those files back. How can get them in the safest way possible?\n\nA: With Linux, most anything is possible, and not really that hard.  In fact, if you do nothing but install a new version, you will probably find that the old installations will once again be bootable.\nBut to do what you want, I would use gparted from a live USB and delete sda2, since you don't need it.  Then, if sda2 is adjacent to sda1, I'd enlarge sda1 to use the new free space, and then get the Super Grub Disk to fix the boot problem.  Once that's done, you could update it to 12.04.\nIf you really want a clean install, you could (using gparted) reformat sda4, use the live USB to copy your /var/www from sda1 to sda4, then reformat sda1 and install 12.04 there.  The install  will keep your windows partition, assuming you pay attention and don't use the entire drive.  \n", "Q: Install Problems on ASUS X401A Notebook okay...

Is there any easy or moderately easy way to do this? I want OS to boot from SSD and keep the hard drive as a file storage drive.\nI know there are some ISO downloads, but haven't found any compatible with Ubuntu Server 12.04.\nThanks :)\nccrama\n\nA: ccrama, I Do agree that this is a duplicate of How to copy an Ubuntu install from one laptop to another but that is precisely one of the things i have enjoyed the most about switching to Linux: Most users (not all, but hey) will be very helpful and instead of shutting you down or making you feel dumb, they help and point at other references. This shows experience and the fact that Linux (Ubuntu in our case) has been around and knows there are issues, but knows how to go about addressing them.\nBoth methods described in the link above work well, but here is the way i've approached it:\nYour SSD will come with a CD for precisely moving your OS install from one drive to another. 99.5% of the time it is Acronis Home. Even though it is geared towards windows installations, it works fine with Linux (asumming you don't have some really specialized File system). If you do, it still works but the SSD has to be the same size or bigger than the original one. However, it will detect that for you and let you know how it will proceed.\nSo, run the utility, choose the option to clone, choose any resizing options you may need on your partitions, and let it do its magic.\nNow, i've had to do this a couple of times so here are some things i've learned along the way:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you did some of the recomended partitioning on your existing system (i.e. /home in separate partition, etc) then great. If not, is the moment to do it.\n\n*Search in this site for SSD specific settings to maximize the speed you can get from the drive ( If not here are 2 bookmarks i kept for this purpose: Tuning Solid State Drives in Linux and A Tweaker's Guide to Solid State Drives (SSDs) and Linux but please keep in mind that they are a bit older, so i would search for newer info\n\n\nSo those are my 2 cents. :) Good luck\n\nA: There are few thing you must do before you can boot. First, you can run your currently installed Ubuntu after you mounted your SSD, then move all files from you HDD to SDD (assuming you Ubuntu server recognizes SDD without any problems) and then do fresh install where you install new copy of Ubuntu on SSD while making sure that it will be your primary HDD.\nI don't think you can actually copy all files from one HDD to the other and making everything working as did before. I believe only fresh installation will make this happen more easily.\nPS. When you install new Ubuntu on SSD this will mean you will have dual boot before your Ubuntu starts. You can basically install the Ubuntu on new SSD and then move all files after installation because as long as you don't format old HDD it will retain all your files.\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Android device connects to my computer, but doesn't play audio over Bluetooth I turn on Bluetooth on both my devices and open up Music on my Android.

The system will run from your RAM and the data on your hard disk will remain untouched, as far as I know. You can then connect an external drive to copy and backup your data before you do anything else.\nFor the future, please spend a little more time wording your question and do a regular backup, for example with CrasPlan Backup.\n\nA: *\n\n*Yes, reinstalling will wipe everything in your hard disk drive BUT ONLY IF YOU CHOOSE IT to do so. I mean, during the OS's Install\nyou will be prompted to choose if you wish to install side by side,\nwipe the previous install or something else. If you choose to wipe\nit out we can say goodbye to your data. If you choose to install it\nside by side you will be asked to determine the partition's size of\nyour new install. Of course, the hard disk drive free space should\nbe enough to include a new install (at least 4GB in my experience).\nThis will also install a bootloader which may solve your boot\nproblem in the current damaged install, which takes me to the second\npoint:\n\n*I don't have a fix for your problem, sorry. Nevertheless, I suggest you to run a search in this site for \"fixing bootloader\",\n\"grub fix\" and these things in order to get further details on how\nto fix your boot problems.\n\n*We can say for sure that the data is right there but you can't acces it because of the OS won't boot. So, if you use a Live CD/USB\nSession you should be able to recover your data, copy and back it up\nin a different hard disk drive and redo from scratch with a new\ninstallation when you are satisfied with the backup results. This\nprocess of \"booting via live session\" won't harm your data just if\nyou use a Ubuntu OS for the process, I can't guarantee it for sure\nif you use a different OS.\n\n\nPlease let us know how are you managing this issue. I'll be around tomorrow in order to provide some support if needed but some other excellent supporters are by here.\nGood luck!\n\nA: I think that your best approach is the reverse order of your questions.  No matter which strategy you use, you should first get the data onto a safe place, so if anything fails, you will have the data.\nThe best way to get the data is probably to use a live CD or live USB \"setup disk\"; the normal install disk for any version would work, as would any alternate Linux disk.  If you were using NTFS or FAT for Linux, Windows could do it directly, but Windows doesn't read the Linux format.\nBut using a Linux disk, you can access both the Windows partition, and the Linux partition, and should be able to copy the files from one to the other in whatever method is most comfortable to you - either using a GUI filemanager or a terminal command line.  If you use a GUI, you probably should show hidden files so you don't miss anything.\nOnce you have a backup of your files, you can probably reinstall without formatting to recover your system, although there would probably be a lot of updates required to get back up to date.  I've never had to do this, so I'm not sure how it will work.  Perhaps someone will chime in with specific experience.\nAdditional info:\nI just tried using a 12.04 live CD on one of my computers, and I found that indeed, the files in my home directory were locked to me as a normal user (username \"ubuntu\").  The files are owned by user 1000, but user ubuntu is 999.  So I can see two alternatives.\nA. I think this is the best way.  Open a terminal and enter these commands:\nsudo adduser tempuser --uid 1000\nThis creates a new user with an id of 1000, which is the default for Ubuntu.  You may not need a password, but I used \"1\" in my test.  Just press enter for all the other questions to pick the defaults.\nsu tempuser\nYou are now logged in as tempuser, with a user ID of 1000, and now have access to the files in your old home directory.  To \"log out\" of the temp account, enter \"exit\" at the commandline.\nB.  Use root access to copy the files.  You can use a commandline, and use either \"sudo\" with each command (no password needed), or enter sudo su to become root, and then enter commands without sudo.  \n", "Q: Input microphone dead Ubuntu 12.04 My microphone doesn't work in any format.\nI've installed Pulse Audio, it doesn't give me the chance to set up.

I connect my PC to my home theater via SPDIF, so when watching video files that uses AAC 5.1 channels, it is downmixed to stereo and the surround channels are lost.\nI would like to be able to convert all 5.1 AAC output to 5.1 AC3, so my HT properly plays 6 discrete chanels.\nMy current approach is to use avconv to convert my files's audio streams like this:\navconv -i <inputfile> -codec copy -codec:a ac3_fixed -b:a 448k <outputfile>\n\nIt works, but it has a few drawbacks:\n\n\n*\n\n*All audio streams are converted to AC3, even the ones I don't need or want to, like stereo, DTS or AC3. I would like to convert only the AAC 5.1 ones. Command should be generic enough so I don't have to inspect the file or pick streams manually.\n\n*While conversion works fine, there are a few issues: volume is huge, loud as I've never seen before, and I fear some metadata is lost on conversion.\n\n*I must run this for every video I want to watch.

The default login shell hasn't been changed in /etc/passwd this can be solved by running chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh which will update /etc/passwd\nProblem 2. Bash is still used even after changing the default login shell using chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh and confirming that your shell is actually set to zsh in /etc/passwd.  This is caused by recycled ssh sessions.

Ctrl+Alt+D minimizes all windows. With alt+tab, you can switch a window into the foreground. \nAll this together means you don't actually have to minimize windows: Send it into the background with alt+tab, which is often better than minimizing. Except when you want to reach the Desktop, which works with the combination stated above. Ctrl+Alt+Down gives the next desktop. Not everybody likes this, I admit.\n\nA: Read through http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/gnome-3.html (Under \"Get your minimize and maximize buttons back\").\n\nA: From your question, I assume you are using GNOME Shell. It sounds like this might be due to some settings being cleared, or changed. (I can't remember which it was, but I'm pretty sure I bumped into this a while ago). You can configure your own maximize and unmaximize shortcuts in the Keyboard settings panel.

However, my question today deals with the following:\nI need help in trying to pull information from Rhythm Box in order to display it using Conky.\nWhat I want is the following:\n» Album Title\n» Song Name\n» Artist\n» Album Picture\nIs there a way to pull these and display them so that they will change as the songs change? I tried my hardest but I'm still a noob when it comes to using terminal and coding.\n\nA: Open a terminal and run man rhythmbox-client. You can get all that information, except for the album art, which is a bit more difficult to deal with, being binary data rather than simple text.\n", "Q: A specific user is unable to log in to vsftpd I am setting up a new user let his name be ftpguy. He has access to only one directory /var/www/xxx. I have already chowned the directory so that he has write and read privileges. The user is also unable to login via ssh as I have disabled that by changing his shell to /sbin/nologin. \nAlso, in vsftpd config, I have enabled the chroot_local_user. Now whenever I log in from ftp, i get an auth error.\nConnect socket #1008 to xxxxxxxx, port 21...   \n220 Welcome to blah FTP service.  \nUSER ftpguy  \n331 Please specify the password.  \nPASS **********  \n530 Login incorrect.\n\nI changed the password to something different several times, using the passwd command, nothing happens, i still the above error.\nHowever I am able to log in with my ssh creditals to my ftp server without any problems.(I do not use a key).\n\nA: I ran across this while letting my friend piggy back off my vps. I had to set his shell to a real shell instead or /bin/false or /bin/nologin. I then used the DenyUsers option in sshd_config to prevent him connecting via ssh.\nIt may be a bug with VsFTP but I didnt have time to get to the bottom of it yet. \n", "Q: Problem with dropbox installing \nPossible Duplicate:\nThere's an issue with an Alpha/Beta Release of Ubuntu, what should I do? \n\nInstalling in 12.10 beta.

It is an elderly laptop that has had a long and varied history with several operating systems, but in its retirement it is acting as a server for my home network using Ubuntu 12.04. It is a single-boot system, there are no other systems installed.\nEvery so often, whenever there is a grub upgrade, I notice a message like this:\nSetting up grub-common (1.99-21ubuntu3.4) ...\nInstalling new version of config file /etc/grub.d/00_header ...\nSetting up grub2-common (1.99-21ubuntu3.4) ...\nSetting up grub-pc-bin (1.99-21ubuntu3.4) ...\nSetting up grub-pc (1.99-21ubuntu3.4) ...\n/usr/sbin/grub-setup: warn: Sector 32 is already in use by FlexNet; avoiding it.  This software may cause boot or other problems in future.  Please ask its authors not to store data in the boot track.\nInstallation finished. No error reported.\n\nShould I be worried about this? What (if anything) should I do about it?\n\nA: It's not a big deal since there is no error reported so just warning.\nBut, if you wish to get rid of this, you need to wipe sector 32. To do this you have many choices:\na. Wiping the whole hard disk;\nb. writing zeros to Whole sectors in your MBR and reinstall your grub;\nc. Writing zeros to sector 32 in your MBR (that's what we'll do here).\nTo do that follow the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup your MBR:\nsudo dd if=/dev/sda of=~/first_63_sectors bs=512 count=63\n\n\n*zero your sector number 32:\nsudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1 seek=32\n\n\n*chroot and reinstall grub:\nHere \"/media\" should be whatever your chosen mount point is. Some step-by-step instructions use \"/mnt\" rather than \"/media\".\nsudo mount /dev/sda* /media/sda*\n\nsudo mount --bind /dev /media/sda*/dev\n\nsudo mount --bind /proc /media/sda*/proc\n\nsudo mount --bind /sys /media/sda*/sys\n\nsudo chroot /media/sda*\n\nPS: replace * by the appropriate number of your hdd\nNow update your grub:\nsudo update-grub\n\nNote: You are not obliged to these steps, since its not an error that may affect your system.\n\nA: I found a couple of useful links that explain what the message is about, and how to clean out the boot sectors on the disk.\nThis thread gives a very good explanation of the problem.\nThis thread gives a nice easy cookbook recipe for cleaning things up.\nThe cookbook worked for me, although I made a mess of the chrooting bit... (see below)\nI am lucky in that my computer is single-boot and I have no plans EVER to re-install Windows. But it seems that if you have a dual-boot Windows system with software that uses FlexNet or similar software, you can expect to have regular problems. Also I think some Windows viruses may use this part of the disk. The first thread discussion offers a solution for Ubuntu users, to install an app called boot-repair on your live-CD USB booter.\nI also found the boot-repair program referred to above invaluable when things go wrong. IMHO this is so useful it should be on the Live CD by default. See this link.\n\nA: Less CLI typing with live DVD/USB\nHere is a way of doing the same with less command line typing, using a live DVD or a live USB.\n\n*\n\n*Boot into a live session (= select trying out (X)Ubuntu).\n\n\n*Use the lsblk command to show all drive partitions.\nNAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT\nsda      8:0    0 298.1G  0 disk \n├─sda1   8:1    0   512M  0 part /boot\n├─sda2   8:2    0   4.5G  0 part [SWAP]\n├─sda3   8:3    0    44G  0 part /\n└─sda4   8:4    0 249.1G  0 part /home\nsr0     11:0    1  1024M  0 rom  \n\nMake sure you target the affected drive (here sda).\n\n\n*Remove FlexNet from the affected drive (here /dev/sda), using the sector number reported by GRUB (here sector 32):\n$ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1 seek=32\n\nThere is no need to backup this usually empty part of the extended boot record (EBR).\n\n\n*Now, mount the partition of the affected drive which is normally used for booting (here /dev/sda1).\n$ sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\n\n\n*Finally, reinstall GRUB on the affected drive:\n$ sudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt /dev/sda\n\nGRUB should now install without any warnings.\n\n\n*You are now safe to reboot from the disinfected hard drive.\n", "Q: How can I programmatically block user input for a given time? As a person working in computer science working offline to avoid facebook and thelike is not always (meaning hardly ever) possible for me since I mostly have to be online to work.\nI have tried leechblock and similar things but the problem becomes that at some point I start making systems for myself to hack, which is kind of pointless if oyu have root.\nI would very much like to try out the method described here.

If I have a file with several characters in it, only a certain number of initial characters is displayed on the Lubuntu desktop and Xfce desktops.\nFor example, I have a file titled, \"interesting-links-on-default-browsers\". It shows as \"interesting-links-on-def...\" with both DEs. However, single-clicking on the file in Xfce shows the full title but the truncated title remains in Lubuntu.\nIt's not a big deal, but if it's just a matter of setting something somewhere to get the full title visible on single-click, I'd be grateful for pointers.\nEdit: Lubuntu 12.10\nEdit on 20121020: For clarification, I'm meaning the icons on the desktop and not the \"icon view\" mode in the file manager (PCManFM).\nEdit on 20121111:\nSee bug #3586184.\n\nA: In default PCManFM in 1.0.0, the behavior was \"Showing full filename in desktop and all windows opened in PCManFM\".\nBut, this has been patched by Ubuntu. Ubuntu shows full filename in the all windows opened in PCManFM and shows truncated filename on the deskop. This was confirmed by lstranger in here (sourceforge.net). Ubuntu retained the older full filename in the PCManFM's windows\nThe full filename is wrapped now in PCManFm 1.0.1.\nThis also is going to be changed in the latest release i.e 1.0.2.\nIn the latest version, it will show the filename according to the icon size also.So, if you have 54 sized icon, the file name will be longer. (source)\nAlso a tooltip will be shown for the full filename when hovered over them. (source)\nNote, this behaviour is same for the windows opened in PCManFM's window and the desktop\nFor recent changes in PCManFM, Have a look at their blog.\nSolution:\nAs a solution, I suggest you to get the PCManFM from the git repository and compile it yourself. In this way, You will at least get  the tooltip and bigger file name's with bigger icons. Good luck.\n\nA: This feature has been requested here and may become available in a future version of PCMan File Manager.

As Django 1.4.1 isn't available in Precise I am wondering if it is best to: \nPackage up Django 1.4.1 and drop it in my ppa\nOR\nwrite a script that wgets Django at build time and installs. \nOR\nSomething better that I haven't thought of.\nI am still inexperienced with packaging and would appreciate some advice\nThanks\n\nA: A general solution is putting a notice on your PPA description for users to manually install newer version, e.g. \"install Django 1.4.1 via this PPA first: [...]\". However, I can't seem to find any semi-official PPA providing this latest release of Django.\nFor Quantal (12.10), 1.4.1 is already included in the main repositories (python-django in Quantal). So, try to re-build the regular Ubuntu package for Precise and put it in your PPA. That seems to be the easiest and best way in your case, I think. More people can profit from your work of backporting this Django version for Precise! It also allows you to set a clear dependency on your package.\nI would avoid any scripts downloading and installing packages from source, unless licensing issues are forcing you this way - e.g. Adobe Flash, Oracle Java, MS fonts, etc.\n", "Q: Is it possible to open directories as administrator?

Once you have located what is known to windows as D: (D: is a Windows-specific label), you will be able to mount it such that you can browse all your files stored there.\nAn explanation to \"mounting\": Windows automatically mounts the physical partitions such that you can find them at mount points labeled C:, D: etc. In Linux / Unix, you can choose the mount point freely (it can be any empty folder).

This spoils my text, I have to undo every time. \nI am very sure that I don't touch my Touchpad.\nWhat can be wrong? Please suggest.\n\nA: I've had a similar experience on my Dell Vostro laptop, it turns out my touchpad was set to be so sensitive, even just my palm floating a millimetre above it would trigger a click-action. The solution for me was to reduce the sensitivity of the touchpad, but I'm not sure that works on all machines though. Funny thing is, I had the same problem in Ubuntu 11.04 and Windows 7 64-bit and it was very frustrating indeed.\nA work-around might be to use a USB mouse (with the touchpad disabled completely, in the BIOS), just to see if it resolves the problem. That way, you can be sure of where the problem is. Once you know it's the touchpad, you can see if tweaking the settings solves the problem.\n\nA: I have connected USB mouse to my laptop, because of I am not comfortable with Laptop touch pad. While typing in this setup, I used to touch Touchpad unintentionally. This was changing the typing cursor to some other position. For this the below fix works for me.\n%synclient TouchpadOff=1\nThis command turn off the Touchpad. To enable it again I used below command\n%synclient TouchpadOff=0\nThanks,\nShivu\n\nA: I've had the same sort of experience. This is what I do to deal with it (it's part of my \"install a new Ubuntu version recipe\").\nCreate the /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d directory. In that directory create the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/70-synaptics.conf with the following contents:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"touchpad catchall\"\n    Driver \"synaptics\"\n    MatchIsTouchpad \"on\"\n    Option \"PalmDetect\" \"1\"\n    Option \"PalmMinWidth\" \"5\"\n    Option \"EmulateTwoFingerMinZ\" \"5000\"\nEndSection\n\nSome also use a program that locks the touchpad for a couple of seconds each time a key is pressed--this is not an uncommon problem.\nIt's the options in the above stanza that do the trick. Your situation may vary because you have different hardware than me. Even if it works for you it may be necessary for you to adjust the values due to a different touchpad/keyboard geometry, different hand size, etc.\n\nA: I have similar experience while using Ubuntu 14.10: cursor jumps around whenever I brush my palm against the touchpad.\nI've tried a number of approaches to resolve this. First,  I can go into \"System Settings\" => \"Mouse & Touchpad\" panel and turn the touchpad off. That works, but I'm afraid of what happens if/when my mouse dies or I forget to take it with me. (It's a wireless mouse.) So I'm trying to write a toggle script.\nFirst approach was toggling 'synclient TouchpadOff' status. I found that using 'sudo synclient TouchpadOff=<0|1>' temporarily set a new status (confirmed by immediately doing 'synclient | grep TouchpadOff'), but afterward changes between 0 & 2 (when looping on this query).\nSo I'm using the this approach:\n    enable:   xinput --enable  \n    disable:  xinput --disable \nwhere 'dev_id' is found using 'xinput list' and searching for an appropriate entry. (My synaptics touchpad was listed as 'MSFT0001:00 06CB:75BD UNKNOWN' w/ id=13.) This seems to work (turn touchpad off|on), but doesn't appear to set TouchpadOff status (remains at 2), so I cannot really write an effective toggle function. Also, using xinput seems to conflict w/ using the \"Mouse & Touchpad\" gui, so if I've disabled it using xinput, I found that I have to toggle it off then on in the gui to get it back in sync. Sigh... Still, the purpose of the script should be to turn it back on if/when the mouse is MIA.\nNext step is to put it somewhere (Launcher?) so that I can get to it thru keyboard strokes should my mouse not be available.\nI believe that Microsoft's solution is to allow the touchpad to be disabled when a mouse is detected, but will immediately turn it back on when no longer detected. (I think that's how it works...) Also, working under Windows 8.1, I find I've not had to deal with the touchpad sensitivity much at all, so they must have set proper parameter values for the touchpad. Maybe Ubuntu could add a similar option to Mouse & Touchpad dialog panel, to turn off the touchpad whenever a mouse is detected. Tough part would be to turn it back on if mouse is no longer detected. Thoughts???\nFinally, does anyone know if there's a way to detect/determine the brush of one's palm and basically ignore it? I turned PalmDetect on, but don't know what values to use for PalmMinWidth and PalmMinZ to effectively desensitize the touchpad when a palm brush happens. Any suggestions? I've set them both to large (500) and small (5) values, but still when I'm typing the cursor jumps, sometimes completely out of the window, sometimes to other locations in the current document. Any suggestions??? I'd love to have the option of using the touchpad, but its hypersensitivity to palm brushes is driving me crazy!!\nI'm going to finish my script using 'xinput --disable' (difficulty recognizing which device is listed by 'xinput list'...), dock it somewhere, read up on keyboard shortcuts, then test out the scenario of mouse battery going dead or unplugging the usb sender from my laptop. If anyone has any further suggestions, I'd be willing to try them. (Haven't yet tried the /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/70-synaptics.conf suggestion listed above; I'll probably try that tomorrow.)\nBTW, on my old laptop, I was running Slackware using fvwm2, could never figure out how to turn off the touchpad, so resorted to a low-tech solution:  covered the entire touchpad with a thin piece of metal taped on w/ duct tape!!\n\nA: The cursor was jumping around seeming randomly for me on Macbook Pro 9.2 with Vivid Vervet desktop edition. Maybe it had something to do with my hand hovering over the touchpad (as indicated in other answers) but I don't know. The solution was to install gsynaptics, go to pointing devices in Ubuntu settings, enable palm detection, crank up the range, crank down the pressure, and voila!\nI would suggest that this gets added to the MacBook Pro installation documentation, along with documentation on how to get the wifi working, a list of what the new keyboard hotkeys are, and an explanation of how to right click.\n", "Q: How do I know if an independent app that is in 12.04 will appear in 12.10 again? There are some apps like usplitter, fogger, lightread and so on in Ubuntu 12.04. Is there a way to find out now if those will appear again in the final version of Ubuntu 12.10?\n\nA: The applications directories for 12.10 have not been updated yet. We will have to wait for the release to see which applications will stay or are updated. There can't be a fixed rule for this - imagine an application that makes it to the repositories in the meantime.\nFor the applications in question there are however some indicators that speak in favour of inclusion in 12.10:\n\n\n*\n\n*Fogger: the developer already has a quantal build in his ppa \n\n*Lightread: runs on Python and JavaScript hence likely will run in 12.10 without any change\n\n*usplitter: is as Java application also very likely to run in 12.10.\n\nA: 12.04 is LTS (Long times support) this means that there will be support for this version for several years this logically means that programs included in the package (not in the apps catalog) will get updates as long there are updates outthere.  And in an improbable case if for whatever reason they will not be in the package in future versions you can manually install them at any time. \nLatter edit: \nActually looking further into the matter fogger, lightread are available via http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Software_Center and not installed by default in 12.04 distribution package. \nIt seems you can search the available apps for 12.10 via apps directory catalog, you can select there what apps will be available for which versions , this link is a search for fogger in 12.10 and it seems will not be there in 12.10 neither lightread but then maybe the catalog for 12.10 is not yet updated. \n", "Q: How to create wifihotspot in ubuntu 10.04 LTS I am using ubuntu 10.04 LTS in my lenovo laptop and have a android ICS device.\nI want to create a wifi-hotspot in ubuntu, which I can later use for connecting android device.

Is it possible to write a script, that does this ?\nI a question I asked a while ago (where I learned about the above script), someone said, the proper way to do this, would be through a wrapper through which every program starts.\nI would also be very happy with a more sloppy solution, like activating this script 100 times per second (simulating pressing the shortcut combination a 100 times per second), if it is feasible - although I was warned, that that may not be a very good idea.\n\nA: You could use cron to schedule the call of your script, but cron can only run a script every minute.

The shadow storage contains System Restore points and previous versions of files for the Previous Versions feature in Windows Explorer.\nTo view the exact amount of storage used by shadow files on every hard drive attached to your system, you can run the command below. You’ll need to run it as Administrator – to open a Command Prompt window as Administrator, search for Command Prompt in the Start menu, right-click the Command Prompt shortcut, and select Run as administrator.\nRun the following command in the Command Prompt window:\nvssadmin list shadowstorage\n\nTo know more Why Do Hard Drives Show the Wrong Capacity in Windows visit this\n\nA: One of the (main) reasons that Wubi Ubuntu installs stop working is the corruption of the virtual disk (\\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk). Typically what you see when you try to boot Ubuntu is the grub> prompt, because grub is still there, but when it fails to find the root.disk it can not proceed.\nWhen the root.disk is corrupted (I am talking about NTFS corruption here), then when you boot Windows it may run chkdsk automatically and attempt to fix the file, in some cases recovering it to a hidden \\found.000 directory (or \\found.001 etc.), and renaming it to file0000.chk in the process.\nSo, in your case, if you had a 17GB Ubuntu install, then you might find a 17GB file sitting hidden away. If that's the case you can either recover data you may have lost, or simply delete the file to recover the space.\nThat's one possibility.\nPS for specific discussion on how to recover the corrupted root.disk, or find it in the hidden directory, see here.\n", "Q: How to list arecords available formats I built a tool that uses arecord, but now i noticed that it doesn't work on some computers, as the format isn't supported by that hardware, how can i see/list what formats thats supported?\nArecords man page says:\n\n-f --format=FORMAT\n   Sample format\n   Recognized sample formats are: S8 U8 S16_LE S16_BE U16_LE U16_BE S24_LE S24_BE U24_LE U24_BE S32_LE S32_BE U32_LE U32_BE FLOAT_LE FLOAT_BE FLOAT64_LE FLOAT64_BE IEC958_SUBFRAME_LE IEC958_SUBFRAME_BE MU_LAW  A_LAW  IMA_ADPCM  MPEG GSM SPECIAL S24_3LE S24_3BE U24_3LE U24_3BE S20_3LE S20_3BE U20_3LE U20_3BE S18_3LE S18_3BE U18_3LE\n   Some of these may not be available on selected hardware\n\n\nA: In alsa-utils 1.0.26, arecord has the option --dump-hw-params for this.\n", "Q: Added key, but dget still shows \"gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found\" Trying to download Django source package using dget and the .dsc file from here.\nThen dget fails to verify the source, because it is missing a public key.\n$ dget https://launchpad.net/ubuntu...\n[...]\ndscverify: python-django_1.4.1-2.dsc failed signature check:\ngpg: Signature made Tue 21 Aug 2012 09:12:04 CEST using RSA key ID F2AC729A\ngpg: Can't check signature: public key not found\nValidation FAILED!!\n\nFine, I added this key to my keyring, because I think I can trust this one:\n$ gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key 0xF2AC729A\ngpg: requesting key F2AC729A from hkp server keyserver.ubuntu.com\ngpg: key F2AC729A: \"Raphaël Hertzog <raphael@ouaza.com>\" not changed\ngpg: Total number processed: 1\ngpg:              unchanged: 1\n\n(well, this output is run afterwards, when it was already in my keyring)\nAnd it is really there:\n$ gpg --fingerprint F2AC729A\npub   4096R/F2AC729A 2009-05-07\n      Key fingerprint = 3E4F B711 7877 F589 DBCF  06D6 E619 045D F2AC 729A\nuid                  Raphaël Hertzog <raphael@ouaza.com>\nuid                  Raphaël Hertzog (Debian) <hertzog@debian.org>\nuid                  Raphaël Hertzog (Freexian SARL) <raphael@freexian.com>\nsub   2048R/71F23DEE 2009-05-07\n\nBut still fails for the same reason:\ngpg: Signature made Tue 21 Aug 2012 09:12:04 CEST using RSA key ID F2AC729A\ngpg: Can't check signature: public key not found\n\nI'm running all these commands as my regular user.

I already tried different combinations for the permissions but couldn't figure out how to do it.\nAlso (side question), if some folder hast some permission set and I copy this folder, along with its contents (assuming I am allowed to read it) to a memory, are these permission preserved ? I suppose not, since under Windows I could delete the folder on the stick, even if under Ubuntu it isn't allowed to delete it...\n\nA: As far as I can tell, the answer to your question is that this is not possible, at least not in the way you want it to work. However, let us dive into that problem and consider several issues.\nFirst of all, notice that if you have at least one file in the directory, it will not be possible to remove it from the command line using the rmdir command. So that's something already.\nSecondly, the permissions to rename the folder are not given by the permissions of the folder itself, but of the folders that contains it.\n\nA: Right click on the Folder then click the properties \nNext click permission tab \nHere now you edit tour permission for the folder. \n\nA: You could give ownership of a directory and it's contents to another user (e.g. in a terminal sudo chown root:root mydir), you can create files in such a directory completely owned by this other user (which makes it a bit more difficult to delete), but under nautilus you can still press the DELETE-key on a directory which simply moves it to Trash.\nConcerning the copy question: permissions should be copied as well, but ownership however will not be copied.\n", "Q: Are there Ubuntu security notices feeds for specific releases The Ubuntu security notices web page has an option to show only notices for a single release. Is there a way to get notices for a single release as a feed, without setting it up myself?

I have Dropbox Nautilus sync running. I want to programmatically pause sync, then do something to the directory, and then resume sync again. Is there a way to pause and resume Dropbox Nautilus sync from the command line?\n\nA: You can control the Dropbox daemon by using dropbox with the start and stop command. Type dropbox help to view the full list of available commands. \n\nA: Install dropbox using the download from dropbox.com.\nInstall Dropbox via command line\nThe Dropbox daemon works fine on all 32-bit and 64-bit Linux servers. To install, run the following command in your Linux terminal.\n32-bit:\ncd ~ && wget -O - \"https://www.dropbox.com/download?plat=lnx.x86\" | tar xzf -\n\n64-bit:\ncd ~ && wget -O - \"https://www.dropbox.com/download?plat=lnx.x86_64\" | tar xzf -\n\nNext, run the Dropbox daemon from the newly created .dropbox-dist folder.\n~/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd\n\nIf you're running Dropbox on your server for the first time, you'll be asked to copy and paste a link in a working browser to create a new account or add your server to an existing account. Once you do, your Dropbox folder will be created in your home directory. Download this CLI script to control Dropbox from the command line. For easy access, put a symlink to the script anywhere in your PATH.\nNow run the dropbox daemon only when you want your folders to sync.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 fails to boot? And 12.04 bootinstalled 12.04 64 bit on my desktop which has an nVidia 6150SE integrated graphics card. \nAt first I had low graphics mode messages but eventually I obtained the login screen perhaps after up to three restarts. Now it fails to boot at all.  \nI tried to get the boot menu by holding the shift key but that does not work. \nIs my only option to get a bootable CD?\nI upgraded my system using Update Manager and  telecharging 12.04 using a satellite link - I think there was a message about compiz during the telechargement.\nWhen I restarted the computer I eventually got a message about low level graphics mode but none of the options except the default appeared to work.  I think the default is to continue in low grahics mode.\nEventually I got the login screen and changed the graphics driver to nvidia-current-updates. - this did not improve things so I tried the other option which I think is  173 with updates - this did not improve things either but  I eventually,  usually after one or more restarts, managed to get into the system and everything worked ok.  I never managed to spot why it suddenly worked. \nI applied at least two updates using Update Manager.   On monday when I started the computer it executed the bios then read the hard disk for less than one second and then hung with a message \"input not supported\" on the screen. The only input that works is ctrl+alt+del.  Ctrl+alt+t does not give a terminal screen presumably because unix is not active.\n\nA: So if I understand you correctly, the Live CD works on your system but an install does not? That's odd.\nOne explanation is that this could be an issue with for example the graphics card (see for example http://www.kubuntuforums.net/showthread.php?58471-Nvidia-Drivers, a similar problem with the same card is reported there). Check what your Live CD is running by starting the programme \"Additional Drivers\". Have you installed the proprietary drivers? If you are running a Live USB you might even try to install the other drivers, see if that reproduces the error. Just be sure that you have another Live USB in case you break the system :)\nAnother option would be to reinstall Ubuntu, see if that fixes your problem. I understand this is really annoying and is definitely not guaranteed to even help.\nAs for your GRUB issue (holding shift does not work), take a look at e.g. Grub Menu doesn't appear when pressing SHIFT. Unfortunately you'll need a working install for this, or you'll need to get into Ubuntu some other way (perhaps you can get into a terminal through your Live CD?).\nSorry that I can't give any \"this will fix your problem\" answers. Hopefully this post can help you think about possible solutions, though. Good luck!\n", "Q: How to start service in a chroot independently of the host system?

I have a PHP script that, while a folder contains XML files, will process them onto the database.\nCurrently, the server is running PHP version 5.3.10 and there's a bug report about memory issues triggered by ZEND_MM_HEAP within a loop.  \nThis causes the PHP to not free memory properly, thus leading to an error and a script crash:\n zend_mm_heap is corrupted\n\nSome solutions are found, but I don't have access to the server settings.\nTo deal with this, I've prepared the following bash script to take care of the loop, leaving the PHP script only responsible by processing the XML file:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Check for files to process\n# If files are present, call\n# the PHP script\n\nDIR=\"/path/to/dir/with/files\"\nwhile [ \"$(ls -A $DIR)\" ]; do\n        php /path/to/php/script/myscript.php\ndone\n\nMy goal now is to have this bash memory allocation limited (memory and virtual memory), thus preventing it to hang the system if something goes wrong.\nMy Question is:\nHow can I limit the memory used by this shell script to a specific amount?\n\nA: You can limit the memory usage by a Bash Script, doing the follow.\nLimit the memory usage by kb (2GB in this example):\nulimit -m 2048000\n\nLimit virtual memory usage:\nulimit -v 2048000\n\nSet virtual memory limit to be hard limit, so that process will be killed when exceeding this limit:\nulimit -H -v\n\nI think this can do what you want.\n", "Q: GUI and C coding gtk files?

Will it work?\nIs there any potential problem with sharing the same /home/myusername folder as my home in the other distro.\n\nA: Although it is possible, I would recommend against using the same home folder across different distros. The reason for this is that different distros will have different applications and application versions. This can cause defaults to not be right, or change them for other distros. Especially when trying out several different distros, it may leave your settings in your \"distro of choice\" all muddled, and impair your view of how different distros are meant to look out of the box. You may end up with more headache than it is worth. If you just care about your documents in your home folder, I would suggest just mounting it somewhere accessible in your other distros, but not as your home folder.\n", "Q: creating a graphic interface for Python 2.5.4 I just downloaded and successfully installed python 2.5.4 ,\nfrom here  Python version 2.5.4 \ntried to search for an IDLE for Python 2.5.4 but no success......\n   Is there a tutorial or anything to help me install the IDLE for Python 2.5.4\nHelp will be much appreciated\n\nA: In Ubuntu 12.04 you already have python 2.7 installed so, unless you need 2.5.4, there is no need to install it.\nTo install IDLE:\nsudo apt-get install idle\nOr you can install it from the software center searching for IDLE in the search box.\nBefore, you could install idle for python2.5 with:\nsudo apt-get install idle-python2.5  but version 2.5 is not anymore included in Ubuntu 12.04 repo so if you can't work with version 2.7, you may have to download v2.5  manually (and dependencies) and install it manually with sudo dpkg -i path/to/package if you get a deb file or compile it.\n", "Q: Update manager notifications not getting in Kubuntu I am using Ubuntu 12.04 .\nGenerally in Ubuntu with Ubuntu-desktop i can get desktop notifications if any new updates are available for the system.

The harddrive is dedicated to Ubuntu. \nPlease help.\n\nA: First, use a command line program called shred to wipe everything from your hard drive. shred will overwrite your personal data with random numbers so that the original data is not recoverable. \nTo do this, create a Live USB Ubuntu drive that you can use to boot the computer from. If you can make the live USB persistent then installed files like shred will remain there for later use.\nUsing \"Try Ubuntu\" option in the live USB, install shred by typing in a Terminal\nsudo apt-get install shred\nUse man shred to learn about the program.\nFinally use shred to wipe the computer's disk(s). \nSecond, Install Ubuntu. If you use the OEM install option, you can set it up with updates and install other software (like Chrome or Skype) without creating an user-ID for your friend. When your friend boots the computer for the dirst time s/he will be prompted for name language timezone etc. the final setup.

It's because you have (or your .bashrc file has) specified the -F option. Unfortunately the manpage is not very clear on this:\n-F, --classify\n    append indicator (one of */=>@|) to entries\n\nBut as far as I know * is for executables, / for directories, = for sockets, > for doors, @ for symbolic links, | for FIFOs and nothing for regular files.\nAlso, the colour green is because you have (or your .bashrc file has) specified the --color option.\n\nA: If you are just using ls with no arguments, it appears that you are using an alias for ls.

I need to know specifically, now that I am using Nvidia card effectively, do I need to allow update manager to update the intel gr. drivers?\nI must add, I believe I know why Update Manager is telling me I need to update those Intel gr. drivers.  It probably happened because I tried to update my nvidia drivers and got a buggy install, which let to to a black screen.  I shut the system down manually after that and rebooted to a black screen and upon a further reboot I ascertained that I could still dual-boot(windows 7) into the other os.  Then I went through the restart process and at the grub2 menu chose other options and it was probably, at that time, that Linux was smart enough to know that nvidia drivers as installed weren't cutting it, and reverted to the onboard Intel graphics system...does that make sense?  Anyway, after successfully getting up and running, I reinstalled my old but successful nvidia drivers and all was well again, except now upon running Update Manager, I am offered the Intel graphics driver upgrade each time, which, up til now I have unchecked...my question is now more obvious.  Should I accept the Intel driver update and if I do, will it once again override my nvidia drivers?\n\nA: You will not have to update the Intel Driver, unless you plan on using it again at some point... But the update manager may update it anyways.. if it does don't worry about it..\nIt shouldn't override your NVidia drivers... \nYou can blacklist the update though if you don't want to install it...

The directory that should be used for custom install is the /opt directory so it would be the safest option to place them there.\nBut keep in mind that for a script to be able to be used without the full path you need it to be included in the PATH variable.\nIf you need help changing the PATH variable for all users you can check How do I set PATH variables for all users on a server? which refers you to the /etc/environment file to configure this.\nIf your concern is to avoid clashes but you don't want to add another route to the PATH variable you could use /usr/local/bin.

Is there any way to prevent ubuntu from shutting down in order to continue running the program from where it has been stopped?\n\nA: If the host operating system shuts down uncontrolled (you say accidentally) be it by an unwanted manual shut down, after an application crash, or worst a power failure, there is no way any guest operating system (not even Ubuntu) can detect and react on such an incident. All data from the guest OS will be lost.\nTo prevent this we need to at least save the guest session prior to shut down of the host.

Maybe it works for you.\nFirst, install laptop-mode-tools\nsudo apt-get install laptop-mode-tools\n\nThen, you must enable the auto-hibernate function. You must edit a text file:\nsudo gedit /etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/auto-hibernate.conf\n\nThere, look for ENABLE_AUTO_HIBERNATION parameter and replace the 0 with a 1:\n\nENABLE_AUTO_HIBERNATION=1\n\nIn the same file, you also want to adjust the battery charge percentage when the computer hibernates. For example:\n\nAUTO_HIBERNATION_BATTERY_CHARGE_PERCENT=3\n\nSave the file and test the configuration letting your battery discharge.\nIf it works, you must set laptop-mode-tools as default, by creating a script:\nsudo touch /etc/pm/sleep.d/10-laptop-mode-tools\nsudo chmod a+x /etc/pm/sleep.d/10-laptop-mode-tools\nsudo gedit /etc/pm/sleep.d/10-laptop-mode-tools\n\nThen, in gedit, copy and paste this:\ncase $1 in\n    hibernate)\n        /etc/init.d/laptop-mode stop\n        ;;\n    suspend)\n        /etc/init.d/laptop-mode stop\n        ;;\n    thaw)\n        /etc/init.d/laptop-mode start\n        ;;\n    resume)\n        /etc/init.d/laptop-mode start\n        ;;\n    *)\n        echo Something is not right.\n        ;;\nesac\n\nSave the file, then restart the system and test again.

This is a problem because I don't use the secondary monitor 100% of the time, and I don't want windows being placed on it when it is off.\nAlso, it's only some windows that are getting placed there. For example, the \"Edit Connections\" window from the networking menu is always placed off my primary screen. There are a number of other windows that do the same. While some, like nautilus, always appear on the proper monitor.\nI played around with Compiz Config Settings Manager and found that if I disable the \"Place Windows\" plugin, all of the windows appear on the proper monitor -- except that they are placed underneath the Unity Panel, so I have to alt-drag them out each time in order to use them.\nWith out without that plugin, I can't seem to get a sensible setup. The windows are supposed to appear only on the active display, but for some reason Compiz doesn't want to do that with some windows.\nDoes anyone know a fix for this? I'd rather not have to disable and re-enable my monitor every single time I use it...\n\nA: Like osarusan linked, sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager, then opening compiz' general options and setting to either prefer smaller monitor or prefer larger monitor has completely resolved the issue for me.\n\nA: I'm not sure what was causing the issue, but since upgrading to 12.10 I haven't had this issue anymore.\n", "Q: Glade stock buttons unable to change As in title I have a problem with Glade...\nField to change button stock icon or label is not responsive.

I burned Ubuntu 11.10 iso to a CD. I was able to boot my PC with it. I plugged in my flash drive, and inserted the CD and restarted the computer to boot Ubuntu.\nI then chose to install Ubuntu alongside with Windows (XP prof.). Then I was able to select my flash drive as the installation location. I prepared partitons by dragging a bar and allocating the size for the Ubuntu installation, and for other files. I set 3GB for ubuntu and 1GB for other files. The  pen drive was partitioned and files installed on it. After sucess I ejected the CD to restart the PC to use the new OS.\nWhen it restarted I expected to be asked to select an OS to boot. But I could only boot with Windows XP. Properties of my flash drive show its total capacity is 1GB. The partitioned 3GB is missing. \n\n\n*\n\n*How can I boot with the USB stick?  \n\n*How can I get my 4GB USB stick back?\n\n\nA: I'm pretty sure you have to boot from bios again and choose boot from us drive again.\nOr enter into bios and set for boot from usb or cd first before harddrive options.\nEdit: You have to just install ubuntu on the usb flashdrive.\nReinstall ubuntu to the flashdrive not boot alongside windows xp.\nSo make sure your flashdrive is mounted \n\nA: Two problems: One, Your computer cannot boot from USB drive. Two, 3GB is probably too small for a full Ubuntu installation. Even if it installed without an error, it may not run properly once it tries to download updates etc. See minimum recommended requirements \nYour best bet is to start over from the beginning. \nFirst, get rid of the Ubuntu installation in the USB drive. To do this, \n\n\n*\n\n*boot windows and copy all the files you need from the USB drive to a\nfolder.\n\n*Format the whole USB drive in Windows so that Ubuntu is gone and you\nget all of the 4GB back.\n\n*Copy the files from the folder back to USB drive.\n\n\nSecond, Boot from the Live CD and install Ubuntu in your hard drive alongside Windows.\nBest of luck.\n\nA: 1st set your bios boot order correctly.(select usb device on 1st order then other else).\n2nd  Ubuntu need to take some space to install(minimum 3gb).If you not satisfy format your usb device you will get back your 4gb space.\n\nA: See the problem is that the boot loader probably doesn't know anything about Ubuntu.

One of the options for login is sitting down at the machine and starting a GUI session.  Programs such as chormium (browser) that preform many read/write operations in the ~/.cache and ~/.config files are slowing down the GUI experience as well as putting strain of the NFS server that is causing other users to have problems.\nUbuntu had the handy-dandy XDG_CONFIG_HOME and XDG_CACHE_HOME variables that can be set to change the default location of .cache and .config from the home folder to somewhere else.  There are several places to set them, but most of them are not optimal.\n\n\n*\n\n*/etc/environment\n\n\n*\n\n*pros: will work across all shells\n\n*cons: cannot use variables like $USER so that you can't make users have different new locations for .cache and .config. Every users' new location would be the same directory.\n\n\n*/etc/bash.bashrc\n\n\n*\n\n*pros: $USER works, so you can place them in different folders\n\n*cons: only gets run for bash compatible shells\n\n\n*~/.pam_environment\n\n\n*\n\n*pros: works regardless of shell\n\n*cons: cannot use system variables (like $USER), has it's own syntax, and has to be created for every user\n\n\n\nA: You have system variables in pam so I would go with option 3.\nSet the variable in /etc/security/pam_env.conf:\nXDG_CACHE_HOME  DEFAULT=\"/var/cache/users/@{PAM_USER}/.cache\" #or any other place\n\nAnd make sure the directory exists in /etc/profile:\nif [ \"$USER\" == \"root\" ]; then   \n  unset XDG_CACHE_HOME \nelse   \n  test -d $XDG_CACHE_HOME || mkdir -p $XDG_CACHE_HOME\nfi\n\n\nA: My solution works for all shells and is done automatically so no admin action required for new users.  It uses ~/.pam_environment along with a short script to be run on login.  \nOn a users' login, the short script looks in the users' home directory for the .pam_environment file.  If it is not present, it creates it and adds the lines to set XDG_CACHE_HOME and XDG_CONFIG_HOME.  Note that in my instance, I am putting the .config and .cache files in /home/nfs_users/username/\nIt is also possible to put them in /tmp/username/ . These will be destroyed every reboot. You may wish to put yours somewhere more permanent.\n\n\n*\n\n*Enable the use of ~/.pam_environment :\n\n\n*\n\n*in the file \"/etc/pam.d/common-session\" add the following line to the end of the file:\nsession required pam_env.so\n\n\n*Create a shell script to run on user login.  It is \"/etc/profile.d/local.sh\". You may or may not already have something in this file.  You may add the following code, or create the file if it does not exist.  NOTE: the chosen directory (in this case /home/nfs_users/) must exist and be writable by all users that log in.\nif [ ! -d '/home/nfs_users/'${USER} ]; then\n    mkdir '/home/nfs_users/'${USER}\nfi\nif [ ! -e ${HOME}/.pam_environment ]; then\n    echo 'XDG_CACHE_HOME DEFAULT=\"/home/nfs_users/'${USER}'/.cache\"' > ${HOME}\"/.pam_environment\"\n    echo 'XDG_CONFIG_HOME DEFAULT=\"/home/nfs_users/'${USER}'/.config\"' >> ${HOME}\"/.pam_environment\"\nfi\n\n\n*Then make the script executable:\nsudo chmod +x /etc/profile.d/local.sh\n\n*Verify that it works.  Log out and log back in. echo $XDG_CONFIG_HOME and echo $XDG_CACHE_HOME should return the proper directories.  Also, once you start running GUI applications that use the cache, the .config and .cache files should have some things in them (check their contents with ls).\nUPDATE:\nSo the old solution stores the files in temporary memory, so it will reset on logout and shutdown. To avoid this, don't store the files in /tmp\nThis changes step 2. I chose to create a folder in /home for the nfs_users (/home/nfs_users) which needs to be writable by all the users that can log in.  You may choose to put it somewhere else.\n", "Q: Read-only filesystem I've resized a partition (ext4) from a Live CD with GParted, and after reboot it says that the file system is read-only.\nI've rebooted again from the CD and checked it with GParted with no errors.\nHow could I find out why does it re-mount the file system in read-only mode?  \nedit: It starts normally, but after some time, the \"/\" mount point gets remounted with read only settings, so I think it does have errors eventually.\nIs there any other way to repair it?\nfstab:\nproc                                        /proc   proc   nodev,noexec,nosuid   0   0\nUUID=20e01341-4171-43da-99e5-7b49d83d21d5   /       ext4   errors=remount-ro     0   1\nUUID=8059f2f1-2cae-44a6-a21d-fe466813e641   none    swap   sw                    0   0\n\nsmartctl -a /dev/sda:\n=== START OF INFORMATION SECTION ===\nDevice Model:     TOSHIBA MK3276GSX\nSerial Number:    617AP1JTT\nLU WWN Device Id: 5 000039 352601a90\nFirmware Version: GS001C\nUser Capacity:    320.072.933.376 bytes [320 GB]\nSector Size:      512 bytes logical/physical\nDevice is:        Not in smartctl database [for details use: -P showall]\nATA Version is:   8\nATA Standard is:  Exact ATA specification draft version not indicated\nLocal Time is:    Wed Oct  3 12:57:01 2012 CEST\nSMART support is: Available -

I have Matlab R2012a installed on Windows and I will like to Launch Matlab from Ubuntu. I can navigate to the matlab folder from windows but i do not know how to launch it.\nI appreciate any suggestions.\n\nA: You realize that there's likely a Linux version of Matlab on that same CD right? That's how it's usually distributed. It uses the same license. Running that under Wine is a bad idea, the thought of my workspace crashing while having a bunch of unsaved computations just isn't worth it to me. Good luck.\n\nA: That is not possible. The method you want to use (using a windows installed version) can only work if that program does not require register keys to function or a licence server to work (and matlab does).\nYou can ...\n\n\n*\n\n*run Matlab native under Linux. Matlab claims to work under Ubuntu 11.10, 12.04 and Debian 6 and up.\n\n\nOther methods:\n\n\n*\n\n*You can use Matlab through a virtual machine (virtual box or kvm for instance) but that requires a seperate install from your current windows one and it also requires lots of resources (/ram).\n\n*Some versions of matlab also work with Wine.\n\n\nThe option of using a windows installed version native under Linux is out of the question though. \n", "Q: Install Ubuntu on iMac 21.5\" (mid 2011) I has a dual boot system with MacOSX 10.8.2 and Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium x64.

Various bugs on Launchpad have \"[FFE]\" and/or \"[UIFe]\" in the title.\nWhat do these acronyms stand for?\n\nA: FFe would mean Feature Freeze exception and UIFe would mean User interface Freeze exception.\nFeatures that are added to the development cycle is frozen at some time in order to ensure that the developers focus on fixing any new bugs introduced into the development release. This is Ubuntu's way of quality assurance since Ubuntu has a relatively rapid release cycle compared to Debian's.  \nUser interface freezes are in place to allow translations and documentation team to effectively complete their part for the development release. If there are new features and strings being added to the development release, the work done by translators and documentation team will go obsolete and also ensure that the development release does not have a chance of being fully documented and translated. In order for that not to happen, User interface freezes are in place.\nHowever, for any particular process, there always happens to be an exception and it is not different for Ubuntu's development release cycle. There are several Freeze exception processes in place to ensure that features deemed important still make their way through to the development release and this is achieved through Feature freeze exceptions and User interface freeze exceptions.\n", "Q: Mounting HFS+ drive over network, write not required I really need to figure out how to configure out how to get my linux box to mount a drive from my mac. They are permanently networked.\nMy Mac is called fuzzy, and has been set up to allow the Movies folder out via SMB. I ran smbtree and this drive shows up as \\\\FUZZY\\Movies.\nThings I have tried:\nsudo mount -t smbfs \\\\FUZZY\\Movies -o username=**,password=** /media/Movies\n\n     Error: mount: unknown filesystem type 'smbfs'\nsudo mount -t cifs \\\\FUZZY\\Movies -o username=**,password=** /media/Movies\n\n     Error: mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on \\FUZZYMovies,\nsudo mount -t hfsplus -o force \\\\FUZZY\\Movies /media/Movies\n\n     mount: special device \\FUZZYMovies does not exist\n\nA: Use slashes (/) instead of backslashes (\\).\nmount will accept slashes, and the problem with backslashes, even if they are accepted, is that a backslash is also a shell escape character. If you want the mount command to see \\\\, you would have to put \\\\\\\\ on the command line.\nSo name the host-and-share you want to mount like this:\n//FUZZY/Movies\n\nWith just that change, your mount commands (except the -t hfsplus one) should be correct. But I recommend writing your Samba mounting commands in a more ordinary fashion, like this:\nsudo smbmount //FUZZY/Movies /media/Movies -o username=**,password=**\n\nThanks to Braiam for correcting a serious error in this command.\n(Make sure /media/Movies exists and is empty.)\nEven better, if you're invoking this manually anyway, leave off the  ,password=** part; it will prompt you for the password and you can enter it, and then the password won't go into your command history (thus becoming visible in cleartext).\n", "Q: How do I open port 51413 for Transmission?

When you  install Windows, you can create a  new partiton in that free space and format it as NTFS or use the NTFS(quick) option of the Windows installer. \nHowever, it is better to install Windows first, as it will overwrite the bootloader(GRUB) of Ubuntu.

For those who don't know:\nsudo su\n\n", "Q: What are some of the basic sudo commands? I am looking to learn sudo commands for the GNOME terminal.   \nI am an avid user of Ubuntu however I'd like very much to learn as many commands and shortcuts as possible. I am running Ubuntu 12.04 32 bit on a Compaq Presario cq60.\n\nA: sudo (superuser do) is a great tool for restricting access to the root account (or other accounts). In normal use, it is setup so that people in the wheel group can run commands as root if they give it their password.\nThe beauty of sudo is that you can grant root access to certain users without giving them the root password. On top of that, you can specify only to grant them access to certain commands on certain hosts. Best of all, sudo logs every command that is run through it, so you can easily track down any issues that may arise.\nUsing sudo\nUsing sudo is ridiculously easy. If you would like to run a command as root, simply type sudo program arguments. For instance:\nsudo passwd tstrombe\n\nIf you would like to run commands as a user other than root, use sudo -u username program arguments, like so:\nsudo -u condor /usr/local/sbin/condor_start\n\nIn rare instances, you may need to start an entire shell as another user. This is not recommended because it will not log the commands you execute under this shell, though it sometimes makes things more convenient when you do not have access to a directory you would like to work in. This will start a root shell:\nsudo -s \n\nFor more tips, I recommend looking at the sudo manual.\nman sudo \n\nConfiguring sudo\nAdding yourself to the wheel group\nIf you type the groups command, you will see a list of groups that you are an active member of.\n% groups\nwheel uucp dialout audio video condor\n\nIf it does not say wheel, you will want to add yourself to the wheel group. You can use the graphical management tools that come with your system, or simply use your favorite text editor as the root user, and edit /etc/group. Add yourself to the line that says wheel:\nwheel:x:10:tstrombe\n\nYou will need to logout and log back in for the membership changes to take affect. Before hand, you may want to do the next step, however.\nEditing the sudo configuration\nOpen up a terminal, and make sure the EDITOR variable is set to your preferred editor, otherwise you will be editing the sudoers file using vi.\nNow you can launch visudo as root:\n/usr/sbin/visudo\n\nEnabling the wheel group in sudo\nPut # signs at the beginning of these lines:(if not found)\n\nDefaults targetpw    # ask for the password of the target user i.e. root\n%users ALL=(ALL) ALL # WARNING! Only use this together with 'Defaults targetpw'!\n\nYou will then see two lines that mention the wheel group. If you have no sensitive data on your machine, and absolutely trust that no one but you would ever use it or get into it, you can uncomment the NOPASSWD one, otherwise, I do highly recommend the first option. This shows our recommended configuration:\n# Uncomment to allow people in group wheel to run all commands\n\n%wheel  ALL=(ALL)       ALL\n\n# Same thing without a password\n\n%wheel        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL\n\nYou can now save this file and quit. You should now be allowed to use the sudo command.\nChanging the password timeout\nBy default, sudo will ask you for your password after 5 minutes of not using it. You can change this timeout to 20 minutes by adding the following option to your sudoers file with visudo.\ntimestamp_timeout = 20\n\nIf you really want, you can also specify this timeout on a per-user basis.\nYou can do much more.\n\nA: Probably your concept about sudo is wrong, to know it's function:\nType man sudo in terminal\nIt is a tool that let a user to do something on behalf of another user.In mostly used to get root privilege  for normal users.\nEg. apt-get install need root permissions to install softwares. So we use sudo apt-get install \n\nA: Note: \n\n\n*\n\n*sudo help you execute a command as another user, Not only root.\n\n*sudo may need you to input password, this password is the password of current user ,not root.\n\n\nFor example:\nYou have three user in your linux system, userA, userB, and root. \nWhen you logged with userA, suppose the home directory of userA is /home/userA. You touch a file and set it can only be read by userA\ncd ~ && echo 'content' >> filename && chmod 700 filename\n\nThen when you logged out userA and logged with userB, suppose the home directory of userB is /home/userB. Then you will find you can not cat the content of filename\ncat /home/userA/filename   //permission denied\n\nthen you can config to make userB can execute cat command as userA. the config process is :\necho 'userB ALL=(userA) SETENV: NOPASSWD: /bin/cat’ > /etc/sudoers.d/userB\n\nThen the userB can cat the file content using this command\nsudo -u userA cat /home/userA/filename\n\n\nA: To get all sudo commands type sudo -h in Terminal.\n\nHere are some the common commands -\n\n\n*\n\n*$ sudo poweroff Sometimes you need to poweroff directly from your terminal. This command will do the task.  \n\n*$ sudo apt-get update To install, remove and upgrade any package we've (APT) package manager.

That file also contains other authorization-related information (see more details here about log files).\nSudo also logs more than just the timestamp, but also the user who invoked sudo, the working directory, and more. If you want to just extract the uses of apt-get install and only log the package name, this would do it:\nzcat /var/log/auth.log* | awk  '/apt-get install/ {print $1 \" \" $2 \" \" $16}'\n\nI don't know if the formatting of the date is important to you, I didn't bother since including that in the commandline above would have made it longer and less readable. But if you want have a longer bash script which converts the format, date -I -d \"Apr 27\" will convert it for you.  \n(By the way, your user must be a member of the adm group in order to read /var/log/auth.log. If you see Permission denied then you may need to prepend the grep command with sudo, or add yourself to the group with sudo addgroup USERNAME adm where USERNAME is your user name.)\n\nA: The most straightforward way to do this would be to replace apt-get with a wrapper script which would log the data into a logfile and then invoke apt-get passing it all the parameters the wrapping script received (and returning the return code the original program returned).\nIf you're careful to mimic the behaviour of the original command very closely, nobody would notice any difference.\n", "Q: kernel panic - diagnosis?

It suggests that it can work, but everything I have read thus far leads me to believe that three monitors will not work in the real world. That being said, Let's dive in and explore the possibilities. \nThere are 2 basic approaches you can take. The first is to utilize randr which will allow you to create one large virtual display in which you can position your monitors. The second is to utilize xinerama which will allow you to have 3 separate X screens which will function as one large display. I will cover both here and you can decide which is more appropriate for your needs.\n\n\n\nRandR - Resize and Rotate\nThe issue with XRandR is 2 fold in multi-monitor setups. It creates a large virtual display and each monitor gets a piece of it. If the total resolution is too high (2048 X 2048) it might not work... Framebuffer issues and such. You should be able to increase the fb size in xorg.conf but it comes at a performance loss iirc. Also, if the monitors are of different resolutions, there could potentially be areas that are either black, or windows fall off of your displays.\nYou can dynamically enable your multi-monitor setup by using XRandR\nxrandr --output foo --rightof bar\nxrandr --output baz --rightof foo\n\nThere is also a gui frontend for this called arandr which is in the 12.04 repos. I haven't tested it, but some have found it useful.\nOr you could enable it statically in /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-monitor.conf:\nSection \"Monitor\"\n  Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n  Identifier     \"Monitor1\"\n  Option         \"RightOf\" \"Monitor0\" \nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n  Identifier     \"Monitor2\"\n  Option         \"RightOf\" \"Monitor1\" \nEndSection\n\nThis method implies an randr setup. Again, there are some notable drawbacks if using xrandr with monitors of different resolutions. Windows may be improperly placed, there may be black areas on one screen, etc..\n\n\nXinerama\nTo enable xinerama you need to modify /etc/X11/xorg.conf:\nSection \"ServerFlags\"\n  Option    \"Xinerama\" \"true\"\nEndSection\n\nIt might be as simple as that as X is pretty good about automagically configuring things based on hardware detection. But, if simply turning the xinerama extension on does not provide the functionality you desire, you may opt to fully configure X to use xinerama. There are a few ways to configure X.

Friend gave me sweet 24\" LG monitor, which worked when I plugged it in. Perfect resolution, etc. Then power went out or something happened and shut system down. When I rebooted monitor displayed out of range 92.9/58. Nothing I do can get past this screen. I tried holding Shift down at boot, but will not pass this screen. Only thing that works is booting from live CD, and Clicking, Try Ubuntu.\nWhen I do that, the screen comes alive and is perfect. I even open Display settings, and it has a selection that is just right. When I reboot, taking ubuntu CD out, I get that same out of range screen.\nI even booted with ubuntu CD, then when it opened, I went into Terminal and downloaded the most recent nvidia driver, 304.51. Said it installed. I went to nvidia-settings in Dash, and a dialog says I need to restart X server. Went to Terminal typed nvidia-settings config (something like that, can't remember), and it said something I can't remember, but about xorg file.\nNothing is working. As soon as I reboot without ubuntu cd, I get out of range. Help!\n\nA: Since the cause of the problem might have been a sudden power outage, I'd try checking the file system for errors. Boot from the CD again, open a terminal window and run sudo fdisk -l (that's a small L, not one) to identify the Ubuntu partition.

If I set in Nautilus preferences that it should generate thumbnail previews only for files larger than 10 MB, then this only works for pictures.\nNautilus still keeps generating thumbnails for videos and pdf files. Even if a video file is 500 MB. It should only generate thumbnails for video files less than 10 MB as set in the preferences. Same goes for pdf. I have many pdf files that are larger than 50 MB. I don't want Nautilus to generate thumbnails for these, only for small sized pdf.\nHow can I make Nautilus to obey the Previews preferences?\nNautilus 3.4.2\nUbuntu 12.04.1, 64bit\n\nA: This is a known bug affecting all the distros (not Ubuntu specific), but it seems to be much more a feature.\nWhat the developers said:\n\n\"This is intentional, because creating a preview for a video file some GB large is not more expensive than creating one for a 1MB video. This is also true for e.g. PDF files, but not for e.g. pictures, which is why we have that preference.\"\n\n\nA: Then they should rename that 'feature'. 'Other Previewable Files' is misleading then. They should simply say 'Images', so that it's clear for users that only previews for images can be limited. Strangely though it's inconsistent. Because if it is set to 'Show Thumbnails: Never', it won't generate thumbnails for video files anymore either. Obviously developers at Nautilus have some problem with logic.\n\nA: This is specially terrible when you have video files on cameras. Nautilus simply hangs while, I believe, waiting for the entire video to be read from a slow USB connection. I have to actually disble thumbnail generation before I plug-in my camera if I have made any videos with it.\nI don't think it's a feature when a software halts execution.\n", "Q: How to convert /tmp partition in to other format ? also give some details about /tmp partition? I'm new to Ubuntu so don't know much about partitions. I have a 320Gb Hard-drive on a HP DV6 i3 2150us. \nWhen I was installing Ubuntu I gave 100 Gb to /tmp mount point thinking that it would be a place other than home to save data. However I can't save data in /tmp . I don't know about /tmp or what it is used for and would be grateful if someone could provide a link.\nAlso if anyone could tell me how to convert it into some other format that I would be able to save data on I would be very grateful.\n\nA: The directory /tmp is, as name might indicate, for temporary files. Do not store any data there, as it can be removed. Also, you probably do not need 100 Gb for temporary files. \n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the /tmp entry from /etc/fstab. That way, /tmp will be just on the root partition (the one with the system files), and you will be able to use your 100 Gb partition for something else.\nTo do that, open a terminal and type\nsudo cp /etc/fstab /root/fstab.backup\n\nThis makes a backup of your current fstab, should anything go wrong.\ngksudo gedit /etc/fstab\n\nLocate the line containing /tmp and replace /tmp with /data. Save the file.\n\n*Make sure that /tmp has the correct permissions:\nsudo chmod a+rwxt /tmp\n\n\n*Create the mount point for data:\nsudo mkdir /data\n\nNow, your 100GB partition will be mounted under /data, and the contents of it will not be removed.\nTo use it as user, you need to give yourself permissions to write on this partition. For example, create a directory and change it's ownership to \"muhammad\" (assuming that is your username):\nsudo mkdir /data/Videos\nchown -R muhammad:muhammad /data/Videos\n\n", "Q: Reboot Ubuntu without going through the BIOS POST Sometimes I am required to restart my Ubuntu machine and don't want to go through the BIOS then Grub. I remember that in windows we just need to hold down the Shift Key while clicking restart and trying the same procedure in Ubuntu without any success.\n\nA: On standard x86 PCs address 0x472 controls whether or not one does a cold or warm reboot. By writing 0x1234 to this address, the BIOS should do a warm reboot, and if zero is written to this address a cold reboot will occur.\nThis can be controlled with the kernel parameter reboot=w (warm) or reboot=c (cold).  So using sudo and your favourite editor, edit /etc/default/grub and change\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\n\nto\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash reboot=w\"\n\nand save.  Then run:\nsudo update-grub\n\nand reboot.  Hopefully, you should be doing warm reboots from now on.  I've not tested this, but the code is there in the kernel to support this, see arch/x86/kernel/reboot.c in the kernel source and how reboot_type controls the reboot. \n\nA: You can try out the kexec-tools (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kexec) by installing them using\nsudo apt-get install kexec-tools\n\nand allowing them to handling reboots on installation.\nTry out a reboot, if your machine comes up without troubles, you're good to go.\n", "Q: I want to get one wallpaper on two monitors streched, i have both of the monitors working fine. ubuntu 12.04 \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to span single wallpaper over dual monitors? \n\nim using ubuntu 12.04 and i havent found any information on my subject for 12.04 ubuntu please help thanks.

This simple tutorial will teach you to install a theme in Ubuntu 12.04 with Unity desktop environment. Follow these simple steps:\nStep 1:\nDownload the theme. If it is zipped, extract it and copy the theme folder to the following location:\n~/.themes\n\nIf you are using the graphical way to copy it, go to your home folder and on the top panel select View and then select Show hidden files (Ctrl+H). Now you can see .themes directory in your home directory. Copying the theme is equivalent to installing a theme.\nStep 2:\nOnce you have copied the theme in correct place, the next step is to use the newly installed theme. To activate the theme we will use a wonderful tool “My Unity” which is a Unity tweaking tool and can be used for various other configuration changes such as launcher, dash, panel etc. To install My Unity use the following command in terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T):\nsudo apt-get install myunity\n\nOnce you have installed the My Unity app, you can open it and move to Themes tab.

What I need is a MIRROR\n\nA: A simple script using rsync tool could solve your problem. The script is:\n#!/bin/sh\nwhile true\ndo rsync [source-folder] [destination-machine:folder]\nsleep 5 \ndone\n\nIf you want a real-time backup then you can just remove sleep 5  or make it as acomment #sleep 5\nTo make it autostarted with your user, You can make a launcher  then add this launcher to the startup Applications in order to autostart.\nMoreover, you can find many other backup tools and other syncronization tools that help you but i just found this script easy to use\n\nA: As outlined in the previous answers, rsync is the most efficient way for copying files over a network. This however requires you to manually initiate the mirroring process. If you want this to happen automatically like a one-way dropbox you can use lsyncd:\n    sudo apt-get install lsyncd\n    lsyncd -rsyncssh /home nashostname backup/dir/\n\n\nA: Ubuntu 12.04 has a desktop backup application that serves that purpose.\nYou can search for \"backup\" in ubuntu dash and set the destination folder in \"Storage\" tab:\n\nYou may choose FTP, SSH, WebDAV, Windows Share (Samba) or a local folder.\nPrograms in question are deja-dup and duplicity.\nNote: Sorry, this answer seems a bit off-topic since you need a mirrored folder readily available (is this the case?) and deja-dup creates compressed archives. Note that deja-dup allows you to restore specific files from backups (right-click on any file/folder and select \"Revert to previous version\").\n\nA: Duplicity is very good and can use rsync as a backend. What I like most about it is the ability to configure filters, so if there are huge files  or files of certain extension you don't want backed up in that directory it's easy to make those adjustments. Note that deja-dup uses duplicity as it's backend and is a real easy way to get started, even creates sensible exclusion filters by default.\nI recommend to cron this nightly. Start with a full backup once a week and then do an incremental nightly. See http://www.rsync.net/resources/howto/duplicity.html\nfor good examples.\nIf you want true real time mirroring then DRBD is the way to go but it's not without risk or complexity. You must create a \"block stack\" in which drbd is backed by your data store and mount that. It has several protocols that trade off between data integrity and speed e.g. sync vs async. It also has the complexity of \"split brain\" where if the source and/or target have moved forward and are not talking to each other, DRBD has to figure out which one is the one source of truth, makes that the primary and forces the secondary to resync to that, get  it wrong and you've lost your data.\nSo you have to ask yourself, do you really need a down instant a block IO is written mirror, and all the complexity and risk that goes with it, or will a periodic rsync (every 5m etc) be good enough?\nFinally, data integrity is best down with a layered approached. Ideally your primary and secondary would both be backed by RAID 1 or similar then you would setup your sync with using the options provided that have a large spread in terms of trade offs between easy of use, data integrity, complexity, and risk.\n", "Q: /etc/hosts keeps getting reset. How am I supposed to edit it? Whenever I edit my /etc/hosts file it's not long before I find it is exactly what it was before I edited it.

The reason why I get this error is simply because there is no distribution folder for quantal\nI tried those repos:\nhttp://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates/ubuntu/dists/\nhttp://ppa.launchpad.net/upubuntu-com/nvidia/ubuntu/dists/\nAny suggestions or explanations? Why is there no quantal folder and how can I install the nvida drivers via ppa (please not manual)\n\nA: Most logical answer: there is no quantal folder because there is no nvidia driver for quantal (yet). Or there is one and the PPA for it does not exist yet.\nAnd yes... in a beta you can expect the answer to be: manual install and since this package is fairly crucial prepare for a re-install when you mess up.\nAlso: a suggestion: did you check \"software settings\"/\"software sources\".

I want to try Ubuntu (tried different distro's many times before), but none were really to my liking. I always seem to be drawn to Ubuntu, thanks to the PPA's and software. What I don't like is Unity, particularly the Dash. That's why I want to use GNOME Shell, I like it.\nI know you can install GNOME Shell in Software Center, and uninstall Unity, but won't there be tons of Unity's configuration files left? And would upgrading from 12.10 to 13.04 still work?\nI know there's GNOME Remix available, but is there any advantage over the standard Ubuntu with the Shell installed?\n\nA: As said in http://ubuntugnome.org/documentation/faq, Ubuntu GNOME Remix, is just Ubuntu with the GNOME desktop environment.\nIt's like Kubuntu (Ubuntu with KDE), Xubuntu (Ubuntu with Xfce) and Lubuntu (Ubuntu with LXDE) and is also officially supported.\nSo the packages that you use on Ubuntu will probably work on Ubuntu GNOME Remix.\nThe official Ubuntu GNOME Remix official website: http://ubuntugnome.org\n\nA: You should be just fine installing Gnome Shell on Ubuntu and leaving Unity as-is. I've done that many times and had great success. I currently use Unity because it's grown on me, but it certainly is possible to use them side-by-side.\nI haven't tried Gnome Remix, but it doesn't seem necessary to me when Ubuntu works just fine with Gnome Shell.\n", "Q: Problem loading Windows My Ubuntu shows the startup screen where I've to select the OS option, in it shows Windows 7 option too, but when I choose Windows 7, it doesn't load and shows back the same OS selection screen.\nBoth OS are installed on the same drive too.\nMaybe during installation, I changed the address where the Windows 7 bootloader is located\nPlease help.\n\nA: There have been problems like this with Windows 7 and 8 for a while. Windows has all sorts of picky requirements when it comes to installing. I had a lot of problems like this in the past, and I think that maybe it had something to do with Windows wanting to be installed on the first partition of the disk. I can't remember exactly, though, because after  a lot of hassle, I just installed Windows on a separate HD.\nIs your Windows on a separate partition of the same disk, or is it on a different disk?\nIf it's on a different disk, you are in luck. Just call up the boot menu when you turn on your PC and boot to that HD instead of the one with Ubuntu on it.\n", "Q: Alt+Tab doesn't work when Citrix is in full screen I am using 12.04 and in my work we connect to a Citrix XenDesktop. I've installed Citrix Receiver, using this Ubuntu help wiki page and it all works perfectly.\nBut, I have a problem. Alt+Tab doesn't work in full screen mode. There are several adjustments you can choose when logging in, with the Settings button in the top right corner.\nI like to work with 95% full screen, with the windows key combination in \"full screen mode only\". This allows me to use the windows combinations when a work in full screen, inside the remote computer (inside Citrix).\nI can Alt+Tab past the \"Citrix computer\" when I put it down to 95%. It also allows me to use the \"Ubuntu menu\" on the left side.

Everything works fine, except file access. Here is the problem. \nJoe's home folder is /var/www/joe and Steve's home folder is /var/www/steve. When they log on to the ftp server they enter to their home folders and they cann't access folders of other users. But when Joe's writes a script in PHP in order to access Steve's file, he can access it. For instance, this script works fine for Joe:\n$filename = \"/var/www/steve/somefile\";\n$handle = fopen($filename, \"r\");\n$contents = fread($handle, filesize($filename));\necho $contents;\n\nIs it the problem of the ftp-server or the problem of apache's virtual-host file?\nHow can I solve this problem please? It is very urgent because it touches the security issue of the users. \nThank you beforehand!\n\nA: The problem is the HTTP server since (by default) scripts are run as the www-data user.\nTo continue your analogy, Steve likely has file permissions for /var/www/steve/somefile set to 755 - which grants read and execute permissions to any user. Because Apache executes PHP scripts as the www-data user, PHP scripts won't encounter any problems accessing the file.\nSteve can prevent others from seeing his file by running the following command:\nchmod 700 /var/www/steve/somefile\n\nThis will prevent other users (except for root of course) from being able to access the file. Note that the same problem applies to directories and because of this, other users may be able to see that the file exists (though they won't be able to read its contents).\nSome FTP clients provides means of changing file permissions, so I would encourage you to consult the manual for your FTP client.\nTools such as Apache suEXEC will cause the PHP script to be executed under the user's actual account - but of course it won't protect against the vulnerability you're referring to.\n", "Q: trying to overwrite '/usr/bin/opencv_haartraining', which is also in package libopencv2.3-bin 2.3.1+svn6514+branch23-12~oneiric After installing some packages and libraries I have an error on Package Manager, I can't run any update because it says: \n\nThe package system is broken If you are using third party repositories\n  then disable them, since they are a common source of problems.

I am using Windows 7 64 bit - do I need to use Ubuntu 64 bit also?\n\nA: That's rather the way virtualization works. When you define your virtual machine you define what it is and what data it can see. When you run that machine it can't do anything outside of what you have defined. \nThis is a reason virtualization is often used for testing or \"sandboxing\" -- it can control both innocent and malicious program errors from destroying important data.\nI believe that one can define additional disk resources for vmplayer by defining and using .vmx files that point to additional file strorage for the virtual machine; and that there is a wizard for defining such additional hardware. I don't know about the availability of these features.\nUbuntu also has includes a virtual-manager and qemu-kvm which can be used to define virtual machines and what they contain.\n\nA: If I understand you correctly, you have made a virtual machine using VMware player, and you are running Ubuntu 12.04.1 on this virtual machine.\nI believe your VMware player does not see your windows drives, because as far as the virtual machine is concerned, the windows drives are running on another machine.

I can't disable showing drive's icons in Launcher bar. I have looked for that option both in CCSM (it used to be in Experimental tab) and in dconf-editor (desktop->unity) and it is missing.\n\nHow can I remove launcher drive icons?\n\nA: Install MyUnity by using sudo apt-get install myunity, then run MyUnity from dash and in the Launcher section, select Never from Show Devices Drop Down menu, That's it!\n\nA: Open dconf-editor: Hit Alt+F2, type dconf-editor and hit Enter.\nIn dconf-editor goto: com ➤ canonical ➤ unity ➤ devices.\nYou will see blacklist with key ['UUID-Label']. Add your UUID and devices-Label in it.\n\nA: (For Ubuntu 12.10 or above)\nYou are right that there used to be a setting in CCSM to configure the behaviour of mounts appearing in the launcher but that option has been removed in 12.10 at the moment. I can't confirm whether it will be added back again before it is released to the public. See bug report #1053704.\nCurrently, you only have two options: Either to show the mount drives on the launcher or to blacklist it from the launcher. You can't configure the setting depending on whether they are actually mounted or not.\nSo, if you want to remove it from the launcher, the only option you have is to blacklist it from the launcher. \nBlacklisting it from the launcher is actually very simple. Right-click on the mount and select Unlock from Launcher.\n\nDo remember that blacklisting it from launcher means you will never see it again in the future even if you mount it unless you reset the settings.\n\nYou can also blacklist the mounts using dconf-editor or gsettings command but that requires you know the UUIDs of the mounts.\nIf you are using dconf-editor, scroll down to com → canonical → Unity → devices and enter the UUID of the mount in blacklist.\n\nIf you want to use gsettings, you can use a command of this format:\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Devices blacklist \"['UUID of your mount']\"\n\nJust use the UUID of your mount inside the square bracket and the single quote marks.\nIf you are not sure of the UUID of your mount, you can use this command:\nsudo blkid -o list\n\nIt will display the partition number, their label (if any) with their UUID.\n\nNow, if you want to reset the settings, run this command in a terminal:\ngsettings reset com.canonical.Unity.Devices blacklist\n\nWorks with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.\n\nA: To completely disable drive icons in the Launcher for all current drives and partitions, simply run the following command:\ngconftool --set /apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/devices_option  --type=int 0\n\nNote that this does not immediately remove any icons currently displayed in the Launcher; it simply prevents icons from appearing in the first place. Thus, any drive icons that appeared before executing this command will never re-appear once they are removed one time. Removal of an icon can be achieved, for example, by an unlock (via the icon's right-click menu) or restart of Ubuntu.\nTo re-enable drive icons, run the same command with a 1 instead of a 0 at the end.\nThis command has worked for me in both 12.04 and 14.04. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to prevent icons from appearing when I plug in external hard drives or flash drives via USB. Nonetheless, it does stop icons for my all of my primary hard drive's partitions from appearing.\nI got the command from this answer to a similar question.\n\nA: (For Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04)\n\n\n*\n\n*Install compizconfig-settings-manager if you haven't already.\n\n*Run CompizConfig Settings Manager and navigate to the Unity plugin.\n\n*In the Experimental Tab, change the Show Devices combobox to Never.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Press Alt+F2 and enter gconf-editor.\n\n*Navigate to /apps/nautilus/desktop.\n\n*Deselect volumes_visible.\n\n\n(source)\n\nA: IT isn't working for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. cant see apps/nautilus/desktop folder there.

It is as running following command in the terminal:\ngsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock show-mounts false\n\n", "Q: Setting up a GUI-based libvirt VM I am attempting to create a virtual machine using libvirt that will have a GNOME GUI and remote accessibility.

Gave me the message no operating system found too.\nHow to access my data and OS?\n\nA: It seems like your hard drive might have been damaged by some of the water. This could have messed with the main boot files in Ubuntu to the point where they are unrecognisable/recoverable.\nTry booting up with the live CD, and see of you can access your documents etc. from your hard drive, and then back them all up (to a portable hard drive or flash drive) and do a fresh install. This will prevent any future corruption issues (hopefully) and allow you to boot into a fresh system with which you can restore your backed up data.\nProbably not what you wanted to hear, but I hope it helps.\n\nA: You may want to try TestDisk, which is a tool to recover documents on damaged disks.\n", "Q: I want to install Xen to run Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7 at the same time but I can't find any good tutorials I'm wanting to use Xen Hypervisor to be able to run both Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7 at the same time using virtualization. I can find plenty of XCP tutorials but I'm not looking to install the cloud stack, I just want the server confined to my machine.\nAll I need is a link to a decent tutorial for this purpose. I've read a ton of articles that lead me to believe I'm on the right track, but not enough to feel comfortable getting it right if I just dive in. I'm getting caught up on whether I need to install Ubuntu and then install Xen into it, or do I need to install Xen on a small partition and then leave the rest of the hard drive open for the virtualization... I dunno.\nBasically, I need the virtualization of Windows 7 for Adobe Premiere and After Effects (until Lightworks for Linux comes out and I can afford NUKEX). If I didn't need those, I'd be rocking out a straight up Ubuntu machine or just using VirtualBox for my virtualization. However, I need Windows to run as an HVM so it runs like I would expect rather than having the issues I may run into with VirtualBox (video drivers, etc).\nSo, any suggestions?\n\nA: What you are looking for is called PCI or VGA passthrough. Xen allows you to pass through a physical device like a USB host or a graphics card to your guest, in your case Windows 7. Doing so gives you native/near-native performance when using the guest OS.\nBUT, to do that you need compatible hardware:\n\n\n*\n\n*The CPU must support VT-d (Intel) or AMD-Vi / IOMMU (AMD).\n\n*The motherboard and BIOS also must support VT-d ...\n\n*The graphics adapter must be VGA passthrough compatible - if it's an AMD, chances are good, if it's Nvidia, then the professional Quadro 2000 and higher cards should work, or perhaps an older card. Look here Xen VGA passthrough Tested Adapters for a start, but this list is not complete.\n\n\nYou may want to look here HOW-TO make dual-boot obsolete for a Linux Mint 13 based tutorial, which should work (almost) unaltered for Ubuntu 12.04.\nJust make absolutely sure you got the right hardware!\n\nA: http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Xen_Beginners_Guide gives a good guide:\n\nBy completing this guide you will have installed a fully functional Xen Project hypervisor and started your first guest operating systems, connected them to your network and have been introduced to fundamental concepts such as virtual machine storage and virtual networking.\n\nYou can also check the many other pages on the wiki for other information, especially the Tutorials and HowTos (from the left navigation bar on the wiki). \nThe Linux Mint based tutorial from @powerhouse's answer is also great, updated (to September 2015) and has a lot of details and other useful links. \n", "Q: Ubuntu hangs at Plymouth screen during shutdown Sometimes(rather many times), when I shutdown using the menu option >> Shutdown, the system hangs at a Purple screen with dots.

My hard drives usually comes as: sda, with sudo blkid and if I plug-in any USB drive, they comes as: sdb, sdc etc; after sda. That's fine.\nBut problem arises after I restart my laptop with connecting those USB drives. They alter and comes first and hard drive goes to the end, like: sudo blkid shows, sda, sdb for USB drives and sdc for hard drives. It's making problem to mount with /etc/fstab.\nI couldn't find any solutions for this. I would like to have any USB drives after my system hard drives, as in Windows. Please, help me at this point.\n\nA: When editing devices in /etc/fstab the suggested method is not to use sd[a-z] naming. Rather, you should use the UUID of the device. This will mean that your mounted devices will not be affected by what device is designated as sda or sdb and so on.\nA great guide to learning how to use UUIDs to automatically mount drives in /etc/fstab can be found here: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-finding-using-uuids-to-update-fstab/\n\nA: First, look in your BIOS for a boot ordering.  Despite the fact that this is usually referred to as \"boot order\", it also affects the enumeration post-boot.  BIOSes vary greatly in UI, even ones by the same vendor, so I can't tell you exactly where to look, but if you could post the make and model of the laptop, that'd help.\nSecond, as prateek61 mentioned, you shouldn't use dev node names in fstab, because they can change.  Use UUIDs.  I myself prefer using labels (man e2label for ext* filesystems) because they actually mean something, but UUIDs are much more likely to be unique.  You could potentially run into a problem where some random disk you add has the same label as one of your system disks, but this is kind of unlikely if you, say, prefix it with a hostname.\n", "Q: Icons in Dash show up in weird colors. OpenGL Issue? I have a somewhat weird issue with my Precise setup (32bit). Since last Friday some colors are very different from the original ones. But only in the Dash (not in Nautilus or the panel).

I got flash finally working in my Firefox on 12.04 (flash stopped working after I updated Firefox to latest version recently (December 2013)).  \nSo, it case it helps anyone, I finally got flash working again by using an older version of adobe flash (10.3.183.75).

But I have closed it and flushed my dns cache, then nslookup a host that I have never visited, then the output is still 127.0.0.1.\nThat makes me quite confused. Can anyone explain this for me?\nBy the way, my DNS server is set to 8.8.8.8.\n\nA: check if \ncat /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf \n[main]\nplugins=ifupdown,keyfile\ndns=dnsmasq\n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=false\nhash(#) out dns=dnsmasq\nsave the file and restart networking.\n\n\n\nIf you don’t want a local resolver you can turn it off DNSMASQ using the following procedure\n\n\n\nYou need to edit /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf file\ngksudo gedit /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf\n\nand comment out the following line from\ndns=dnsmasq\n\nto\n#dns=dnsmasq\n\nSave and exit the file\nNow you need to network-manager using the following command\nsudo restart network-manager\n\nRef: http://www.stgraber.org/2012/02/24/dns-in-ubuntu-12-04/\n\nA: By default Ubuntu does indeed cache DNS entries with Dnsmasq. Dnsmasq does a lookup when a DNS entry is not in its cache, which is why you'll always see the localhost (127.0.0.1) IP address  when doing a DNS lookup without specifying the nameserver.\nIn the manpage it's explained as follows:\n\nDnsmasq accepts DNS queries and  either  answers  them  from  a  small,\n  local,  cache  or  forwards  them  to a real, recursive, DNS server. It\n  loads the contents of /etc/hosts so that local hostnames which  do  not\n  appear  in  the global DNS can be resolved and also answers DNS queries\n  for DHCP configured hosts.\n\nThis behaviour can be overridden by editing /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf and changing dns=dnsmasq to #dns=dnsmasq, after which you'll need to restart the network-manager service (sudo service network-manager restart).\nMore information can be found in the community documentation and in the manpage.\n", "Q: How to download once and update all computers? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I install software or packages without Internet (offline)?\nBest way to cache apt downloads on a LAN? \n\nmaybe this will be a duplicate post, but I've found nothing.\nI work at a school, in the Computer Lab we have 8 computers and I installed Ubuntu on them.

If I update all the computers, the internet goes terribly slow, because the use of bandwidth (we have a 5MB connection only).\nIs there a way to download the pakages once in a computer and the rest of the computers grab the files from it? Also, if a file is not in the principal computer, it can be downloaded from the Internet.\nI've seen that is possible to use aptproxy, but the idea is not to have all the repositories in the computer, only the ones we use (when we run updates or install programs)\nThank you\n\nA: 1st you have download APTonCD package.\nthis package will help you to create .iso image file of which you have download from internet.\nafter creating image file,image file content or packages are ready to install other machine.\n\nA: apt-proxy does what you're asking for.  It doesn't get files you don't need, as you seem to think.\nFrom the description:\n\"It builds up a partial Debian mirror, containing those files which have been requested by clients.\"\nI used to run it, when I needed that service, and was very happy with it.  It did its job, and I didn't have to think about it much, as I remember.\nHowever, it looks unmaintained now; it isn't in current Ubuntu or Debian.  The packages apt-cacher and approx are replacements.  I haven't used them myself.  It's not a terribly difficult job, and it sounds like they have replaced apt-proxy satisfactorily.\nThis article from Linux Weekly News covers the topic, but is three years old.  You could check that out, though it probably goes into more alternatives than you need.  I think the odds are good that if you try apt-cacher and/or approx you'll get what you want.\n", "Q: Blacklisting grub packages from installing I am trying to block GRUB packages from being installed (after having purged them).  The problem is virtually identical to Blacklisting packages from installing and even involves GRUB which is exactly what the selected answer illustrated doing.\nHowever, it does not work in 12.04 LTS using the cloud-image edition.\nIn my scripts to do all this, I first delete the packages involved.  It has an annoying UNinstall prompt, but I finally figured out how to feed it answers (see https://askubuntu.com/questions/195801/when-uninstalling-all-grub-packages-for-ec2-ami-build-script-how-do-i-bypass-pr for my older question) to make it move along.

First, it's a list of sections (like admin), not package names (like grub-pc). Second, it requires exact names, not wildcard patterns. Third, it doesn't prevent a package from installing anyway: what it means is that if the package is pulled in by a dependency, it will not be marked as automatically installed.\nGrub is recommended by the standard kernel image. An easy way to not getting it reinstaled is to tell APT not to follow recommend-level dependencies, with --no-install-recommends on the command line or APT::Install-Recommends \"false\"; in apt.conf. I don't know of a way to ignore a specific dependency.\nYou can block a package from installing by giving it a negative priority in /etc/apt/preferences, see How to forbid a specific package to be installed?. But that won't solve your problem since APT will still try to pull in the dependency.\nYou can make a fake grub-pc package with equivs, see How to fake a package version installed?. That's what I'd do here: you have Grub, but not provided through a deb package, so make a fake package to tell that to the package manager.\n", "Q: Why gimp 2.8 slow on ubuntu 12.04?

I would like to add settings to the file apt.conf , but I realized that it was replaced by a folder called etc/apt/apt.conf.d/. \nHow can I configure with this new model?\n\nA: From versions newer than Gutsy, the file /etc/apt/apt.conf has been replaced by /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/proxy (create it if needed), with the same structure.\n\nA: Find the existing configuration by apt-config dump command, e.g.:\napt-config dump | grep -we Recommends -e Suggests\n\nChange the values and add into /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99somefile (a new file). The number before file gives priority (lower runs earlier, higher runs latest).\nHere is the example disabling APT::Install-Recommends and APT::Install-Suggests:\napt-config dump | grep -we Recommends -e Suggests | sed s/1/0/ | sudo tee /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99norecommend\n\n\nA: It is best to create your own user file in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d so you can guarantee that it won't be overwritten by package updates. Rather than adding to existing files in the directory, create your own general file called 99mysettings  with\nsudo touch /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99mysettings \n\nIt is labelled with a 99 so that your settings are run last and so override any of the same values for the specified settings present in other files in the directory.\nThen to edit your file run\nsudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99mysettings\n\nand then, for example, you could add the following (although not usually recommended) configuration item:\nAPT::Install-Suggests \"true\";\n\nIf you wanted apt to stop installing recommended packages (again not usually the best decision) you could use \nAPT::Install-Recommends \"false\";\n\nThe syntax of these commands differs to how the man page will describe how entries for the older apt.conf should be set up; previously APT::GET::Install-Suggests \"true\"; would have been the syntax, but that will not work for the example above. \nThe man page will give you an indication of the general settings available, so please enter man apt.conf or see the Ubuntu manpages online. However, the best source for apt configuration settings is the Debian Handbook, available here online or as a complete pdf here, and it contains very useful information that is mostly applicable for Ubuntu as well.\n\nA: The apt.conf file which contains configuration for APT is by default located in /etc/apt/. \nTo check what's under apt directory, do the following in terminal:\ncd /etc/apt\nls\n\nThe apt.conf file should be listed after the ls command.\nHowever, if it does not exist, you can create it by running the following command:\ngksu gedit apt.conf\n\n(Make sure the present working directory is /etc/apt, if not, then cd to /etc/apt first.)\nThis will ask for your password and launch gedit allowing you to create your apt.conf file.\nYou can also use:\nsudo nano apt.conf\n\n\nA: Just create the file /etc/apt/apt.conf if you need it, and put in the stuff you want.\nman apt.conf\n\n", "Q: SFTP permission denied on files owned by www-data I have a pretty standard server set up running Apache and PHP. An app I am running creates files and these are owned by the Apache user www-data. Files that I upload via SFTP are owned by my own user charlesr. All files are part of the www-data group. My problem is that I cannot modify or overwrite any of the files via SFTP which are owned by www-data, even though charlesr is part of the www-data group. I can modify the files no problem via a SSH session.\nSo I'm not sure what to do. How do I give my SFTP session permissions to modify www-data owned files?\nFor a bit of background, these are the notes I wrote for myself when setting-up the server:\nNow set up permissions on `/var/www` where your files are served from by\ndefault:\n\n$ sudo adduser $USER www-data\n$ sudo chgrp -R www-data /var/www\n$ sudo chmod -R g+rw /var/www\n$ sudo chmod -R g+s /var/www\n\nNow log out and log in again to make the changes take hold.\n\nThe previous set of commands does the following:\n\n1. adds the current user ($USER) to the `www-data` group;\n2. changes `/var/www` to belong to the `www-data` group;\n3. adds read/write permissions to the group that `/var/www` belongs to;\n4. sets the SGID bit on `/var/www`; this final point bears some explaining.\n\nAnd then I go on to explain to myself what setting the SGID bit means (i.e. all files created in /var/www become part of the www-data group automatically).\n\nUPDATE\nIt seems that the problem was caused by the app itself or, more\nspecifically, the application framework (Kohana) setting certain files\nit writes to 0644 (rw-r--r--); i.e. not group writable. This, coupled\nwith the fact that the files are also owned by www-data meant that I\ncould not edit the files via SFTP when logged-in as charlesr. I'm not\nsure why I could edit the files via SSH. My guess is that I \nmust have used sudo.\nHere is the permissions strategy I now use thanks to the tireless help of\nMarty Fried, who pointed out the flaws in my previous strategy and also\nhelped me marinade in the world of Linux permissions until I finally\ngrokked it. Thanks Marty!\nOverview\n\n\n*\n\n*Files and directories in /var/www should be owned by root:webmasters\n\n*All devs should be members of the webmasters group\n\n*All directories in /var/www should be set to:\n 2775 or u=rwx,g=rwxs,o=rx (rwxrwx-r-x)\n\n*All files in /var/www should be set to:\n 0664 or ug=rw,o=r (rw-rw-r--)\n\n\nThe following should be owned by www-data:webmasters (i.e. these are the directories that Apache needs to be able to write to):\n\n\n*\n\n*application/cache\n\n*application/logs\n\n*upload\n\n*client_helpers/upload\n\n\nHOWTO\nTo set up permissions on /var/www where your files are served from by default:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo addgroup webmasters\n\n*sudo adduser $USER webmasters\n\n*sudo chown -R root:webmasters /var/www\n\n*sudo find /var/www -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \\;\n\n*sudo find /var/www -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \\;\n\n*sudo find /var/www -type d -exec chmod g+s {} \\;\n\n*sudo chown -R www-data:webmasters application/cache/   [etc...]\n\n\nNow log out and log in again to make the changes take hold.\nThe previous set of commands does the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a new group called webmasters; all users who need write access to the app files will be added to this group.\n\n*adds the current user ($USER) to the webmasters group.\n\n*changes the owner of /var/www to root and the group to webmasters group.\n\n*adds 664 permissions (-rw-rw-r--) to all files in /var/www.\n\n*adds 775 permissions (drwxrwxr-x) to all directories in /var/www.\n\n*sets the SGID bit on /var/www and all directories therein; this final point bears some explaining. Note also that you can also put a 2 at the front of your chmod octal (e.g. 2644) to do the same thing.\n\n*sets the owner to www-data (Apache's user) and group of the supplied directory to webmaster. This ensures the directory is writable by Apache and anyone in the webmasters group. Do the same for all other directories that need to be writable.\n\n\nA: I noticed you hadn't used chown.\nTo properly set the ownership of the files/folders you can set the whole directory this way:\nchown -R www-data:www-data\nThis sets ownership to group www-data and user www-data\nAlso, you can do this as a temporary workaround :\nchmod 777 /var/data/<filename> or chmod 777 /var/data/<foldername>\nedit the file(s) as needed, then\nchmod 644 /var/data/<filename> or chmod 755 /var/data/<foldername>\nBe careful of using the \"-R\" switch, as it changes the permissions of all the sub files and folders as well.\n664 is the Apache standard file permissions, and 755 the standard folder permissions.\nHope this helps :)\nStar\n\nA: Ubuntu.com has pretty good serverguides, such as Apache guide.  Where did you get your procedures you so carefully wrote down?  I've never had to go to that much trouble for any of the servers I've set up, although I'm open to the possibility that I haven't been doing it right - also, I haven't actually install servers for anything that is very public, or very large, so there could be security holes that I don't know about.  \nHowever, I've never needed to be a member of the www-data group, and no source files in www are owned by www-data.  My understanding is that this is used by Apache only for its own files, and it will not have write permissions to any of the other files itself, because in theory, no important files will allow www-data to have write permission.  I'd guess that files owned by www-data would give read-only permission to everyone else, and nobody should have write permission to its files.  I could be totally wrong, of course, and if I am, I hope someone will tell me and point me to actual documentation that explains differently (not to some forum where a random internet user like me has produced instructions that worked for him).  \nPerhaps I'm missing something, but your problem should be fairly straightforward.  The user that is logged in using sftp needs to be a member of the group www-data, and the files you are trying to modify must have write permissions for the group www-data.  It doesn't make sense to me that you can modify the files using ssh, but not using sftp; are you sure you are logging in to the same account for both?  In sftp, you can enter commands such as !groups to list your groups, or !whoami to check what login name you are using.  The results should match what you see using ssh (with the same commands minus the exclamation point).\nYou also should be able to use chmod, chown, chgrp from sftp if you have permission to do so.\nBy the way, I think your list has at least one pretty bad command: \nsudo chmod -R g+rw /var/www\nThis gives the world write permission to every file and folder in /var/www.  This sounds like a bad idea. Normally, only root has write permission to these directories, unless specific ones need more permission, usually only single directories.   \nNote:  This was an error on my part.  Thanks to DonalLafferty for pointing this out, that it specifies \"g\", not \"a\", so it only changes group permissions.  My tired old eyes (or a bad font) must have read it as \"a\". \nEdits for clarification\nNormally, files created by Apache are read-only for both the www-data group and all other users, same as the root-owned files in /var/www.  So, there should be no reason to make anyone a member of www-data.  The issue is giving everyone write access, which is a different case.  This should be done by making specific directories available within your site, and this is done simply by using chmod, either with sudo, since it is probably owned by root, or by making the owner yourself and not using sudo.\nIf you have more devs that need access to the entire site, that is when you want to make a user+group such as \"webmasters\", make it the owner of the site, give write permissions to that group, and make all devs members of that group. So the listing for the site directories would be something like:\ndrwxrwxr-x  ##  webmasters     webmasters   #### ####-##-## ##:##  mysite.com\n\nMore Edits\nI've since realized that you don't really need to create a user \"webmasters\", just a group.  Then the files can be owned by root:webmasters, ie root is the owner, but webmasters is the group.\nIn answer to questions below, the files that Apache writes will be owned by www-data, and group www-data.  These files are not normally something you write to, so non-members of www-data may have read-only access - I think it depends on the directory permissions.  If you do need more than occasional write access, then adding yourself to the group might be useful.  Usually you make specific directories world writable for content saved by Apache.  Consider also that most shared web hosting running Apache without shell access would not even have a way to set up groups.\nBut, Apache can read files even owned by root.  Almost all files have world-readable access, just not writable.  So, unless you want to change this, Apache doesn't need to be in the webmasters group.  \nThis is all basic Linux setup, not really Apache.  Apache only cares about access from within the web server, and that's set by the config files.  For this reason, the Ubuntu documentation link I included in my post should be considered a better source than a public wiki.\nBy the way, the O'Reilly Apache Cookbook says \"Document directories, such as htdocs, cgi-bin, and icons, will have to have permissions set in a way that makes the\nmost sense for the development model of your particular web site, but under no circumstances should any of these directories or files contained in them be writable by the web server user.\"  \nFinally, using ACLs is a good way to set file permissions if you need more control.  It may even be a good way to set them all the time, and is something I should investigate.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 patched b43 driver compilation error I tried this How do I install this patched b43

Is there a tool to create a remote working terminal for each of them or maybe using file sharing etc ?\n\nA: You should use a revision control system such as bzr or git, for your source code. Then everyone can work independently and merge there changes into the central repository. There are also commercial contracts available for https://launchpad.net/ for hosting private projects if you'd prefer to contract out maintaining such services.\n\nA: You could install a nx-server on a machine and access it remotly with nx-client. This will allow you to setup a good development plattform which can be accessed from any OS from anywhere.\nStill, sharing the working sourcecode is a absolute no-go. Invest the time to setup git or at least svn. This will become a hugh timesaver in less than a month.

I'm working on an open source space shooter called orxonox. (www.orxonox.net)\nSince the Ubuntu 12.04 release we faced a problem that we couldn't fix which is related to the upstream library tinyXML or Cegui ( http://forum.orxonox.net/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=660 ).\nThat bug is blocking our upcoming release. I'd be grateful if I can find someone who could be a mentor for both targeting the bug and the release process.\n\nA: I see cegui is a Ubuntu Universe package.\nFirst I think you should report the bug here. We generally refer people to How do I report a bug? for help in filing bugs.\nSecond, you should check upstream (Debian and cegui.org.uk) to see if there is already a bug report for the bug you are seeing.\nIf there isn't already a fix it would be most effective if you could develop a patch for the package to fix the problem, or at least diagnose it as thoroughly as possible. If you can come up with a patch you can attach it to each of the bug reports. Getting upstream to accept the patch or develop one may convince the Ubuntu MOTU team that the patch is good.\nSee this page for the procedure to get the patch sponsored into Ubuntu Universe for the current development release. It's still not too late to get some patches into Ubuntu Universe for 12.10 but soon will be as its release is imminent. Getting a patch or new release into the development release is usually the first step in getting it into older releases (for reasons of quality assurance).\nThe MOTU team hangs out at irc://irc.freenode.net/#ubuntu-motu.\n", "Q: How to install and use FLWM?

I'm missing some very basic Ubuntu One usage information, like how to synchronize the files between Ubuntu One, my Android phone, and my Ubuntu 12.04 PC. \nIs there a users guide or reference manual someplace?\n\nA: FolderSync is an app that lets you sync selected folders between Android and various cloud services, including Ubuntu One. The free version shows ads and limits the number of cloud services you can use simultaneously.\n\nA: The android app can be found here.\nThe way this works is that everything in the Ubuntu One folder (located in your home folder) is automatically synchronized to the cloud. You can add more folders to be synchronized by right clicking on them in the file manager and navigating to the Ubuntu One sub menu and finally clicking Synchronize This Folder. \nOn Android your photos are uploaded to a folder named after the model of your phone (mine is Pictures - HTC Ruby), and you can select files to be downloaded from Ubuntu One to your phone. These are not synchronized with their versions in the cloud after download, however. You can upload files within the android app by navigating into a folder and hitting the + icon in the right. You will need an app like File Manager installed to be able to just select any file from the SD card, however. To do this, select Add file after tapping the + icon and select File Manager (or your preferred app) from the list. \n\nTo get your pictures or other files in Ubuntu One on your PC you need to use the Ubuntu One app for Ubuntu (Open the dash and type Ubuntu One). Select the folders here that you want to sync to your computer:\n\nThe folders in the cloud that you select will be placed in your home folder and synchronized with other computers. For example I sync my scripts so I always have my most current work no matter which machine I turn on.\nThere is also a music app for Ubuntu One that requires a subscription to work. It can stream your whole music collection to you, which is great if you have an unlimited data plan. It can be found here, if you are interested.\n\nA: Very old post and strangely, Ubuntu One Mobile App still does not support syncing like Ubuntu One desktop App. In mobile devices, it just lets you access what's present in your U1 account. If you download and modify a file, it does not sync back to U1.\nAs far as third party sync apps are concerned, i don't trust them on the permissions they ask, and the ads they show.\nI had the same issue while using Ubuntu One App on my BlackBerry Z10. This solution I came up with, will work for all platforms all devices not just Z10.\nIt might seem little complicated to use for some users. But here it is.\nI have created a very basic shell script to sync a folder(which is already in sync with Ubuntu One App in my Laptop)\nShell script I use to sync the folder with phone memory or memory card :\nAfter connecting my phone using USB mass storage(my memory card name is MICROSD in my case)\nThe folder ~/MyFolder is already in sync with U1 in my laptop(OS: Ubuntu12.04).\nSo this goes to:\n1.

You can now hit enter on SyncMyFolder.sh and choose \"Run in terminal\". It'll show you what is being done in the terminal window.\nWhen you see \"echo phase 2/2 completed..\", the folder is synced.\nThe only con of this process is that i have to sync my phone this way every night manually. The files I modify on my phone are now synced with U1.\nCheers!\n\nA: There is another possibility to sync files from Ubuntu One on your Android Mobile to your PC. However, it means using dropbox to transmit the file temporarily between the SD card and the Ubuntu one folder. That said, I would prefer this method than installing something unknown or messing too much with the configs. At the end of the day your main storage is in Ubuntu and you delete the file to be transported in dropbox later. It's just a temporary transport mechanism but this works to sync from Ubuntu back to the PC then.\nStep 1 - open doc with office, edit doc etc.\nStep 2 - save as, /storage/sdcard0/u1/Ubuntu One/folder\nStep 3 - Go to /storage/sdcard0/u1/Ubuntu One/folder\nStep 4 - Click file and send it to dropbox\nStep 5 - Go to Ubuntu and click 'add file' from dropbox folder where you saved\nStep 6 - Sync file on mobile device and it will appear on your desktop now in file list\nDelete file from dropbox\nPlease note dropbox's privacy policy.\n5. data retention \"there may be latency in deleting information from our servers and backed up versions might exist after deletion\"\nStep 2b.

But now I learned about apport-collect and apport-bug which basically are:\napport-bug - Reports problems to launchpad using Apport to collect a lot of information about your system to help the developers fix the problem and avoid unnecessary questions and answers.\napport-collect - Works as apport-bug but it send the information to an already existing bug report. In my case it was apport-collect 1060268 Thanks to Brad Figg in Launchpad.\nAre there any other tools to report bugs?\n\nA: ubuntu-bug and apport-bug are actually the same package Apport. When you initiate ubuntu-bug or apport-bug without any additional parameters, one of the following Apport user-interfaces is called, depending on the desktop environment:\nApport User interfaces for filing bugs\n\n\n*\n\n*apport-gtk - GTK GUI for reporting crash-type bugs in Unity and GNOME.\n\n*apport-kde - KDE GUI for reporting crash-type bugs in KDE.\n\n*apport-cli - command-line front-end for reporting crashes and is intended for use on servers. You can also use it to report bugs if the crash happens offline.\n\n\nDo note that Apport is NOT enabled by default. You have to manually enable it in order to report crash-type bugs:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I enable or disable Apport?\nYou can also report issues other than application crashes using any of the above tools with an additional parameter -f. It is not necessary to enable Apport for reporting non-crash issues. See manual page for apport-cli for more information.\nOther Apport utilities\n\n\n*\n\n*apport-collect - Used to collect and attach essential debugging data to an existing bug report. Generally used in case of bugs filed against Linux kernels. You should not be using this unless you are the original bug reporter or one of the kernel developers explicitly asks you to do so. See manual page for apport-collect for more information.\n\n\nWhoopsie service\nAll 12.04 systems, including desktop and server, have an \"Ubuntu Error Reporting\" daemon called whoopsie. It, along with apport, is part of the Ubuntu error tracker project. While it isn't one of the tools that allow you to report bugs, it is part of the system that processes the bug reports. \nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*What is the 'whoopsie' process and how can I remove it?\n\n*How can I track a bug that caused a crash and was reported via apport / whoopsie?\nDebian bug reporting tools\nThere also exists reportbug which helps you file bug directly in Debian bug tracker from an Ubuntu system.

In fact, I'm packaging multiple releases of MATLAB to be installed concurrently. Key things\n\n\n*\n\n*Very large installation size (~4 GB)\n\n*Composed of a core, and several plugins (toolboxes)\n\n\nInitially, I created a single \"source\" package (matlab2011b) that builds several .debs (mainly matlab2011b-core and matlab2011b-toolbox-* for each toolbox).  The debian/rules file is just the standard \nall:\n dh $@\n\nThere is no Makefile; only copying files. I use a number of debian/*.install files to specify files to copy from a copy of an installation to /usr/lib/.\nThe problem is, every time I build the thing (say, to make a correction to the core package), it recopies every file listed in the *.install file to e.g debian/$packagename/usr/ (the build phase), and then has to bundle that into a .deb file.  It takes a long time, on the order of hours, and is doing a lot of extra work.\nSo my questions are:\n\n\n*\n\n*Can you make dh_install do a hardlink copy (like cp -l) to save time?  (AFAICT from the man page, no.)  Maybe I should just get it to do this in the Makefile?  (That's gonna be a big Makefile.)\n\n*Can you make debuild only rebuild .debs that need rebuilding?  Or specify which .debs to rebuild?\n\n*Is my approach completely stupid?  Should I break each of the toolboxes into its own source package too?  (I'll have to do some silly templating or something, because there's hundreds of them. :/)\n\n\nA: 1. You can make dh_install do whatever you want by adding this to debian/rules:\noverride_dh_install:\n    dh_install # if you still want to use some things via *.install files\n    cp -l src/foo debian/$packagename/usr/share/$matlabname/foo\n    cp -l tools/bar debian/$packagename/usr/share/$matlabname/tools/bar\n    # etc...\n\nI don't know if this is a good idea though...\n2.

(i.e: physical volume) I want to shrink my second (LVM) partition, in order to create a new partition in the newly freed space. I am using the Live CD to do so, because I know I can't resize/move this partition while it is in use. When I opened GParted in the Live CD, I realized that I could not resize the partition, because when I right-click it, the option \"resize/move\" is disabled.\nI tried to unmount it, to \"lazy\" unmount it (umount -l /dev/sda2) but it didn't work.\nA screenshot from GParted:  \n\n\nA: Back up all your important data before attempting this. Always assume that you can lose all your data when resizing partitions.\nShrink LVM without dataloss\nThis forum thread suggests the following procedure, in this example we shrink a partition from 10G to 9G:\n\nFirst, we unmount.\nsudo umount /dev/vg_blah/lv_blah\n\nCheck the file system.\nsudo e2fsck -f /dev/vg_blah/lv_blah\n\nResize the file system and the logical volume. Doing this in one step can avoid mistakes which cause dataloss. (Note lvreduce parameter -L interprets G as 2^30 bytes and g as 10^9 bytes.)\nsudo lvreduce --resizefs -L 9G /dev/vg_blah/lv_blah\n\n(optional) Remove a physical drive from the volume group if desired (if you now have an unused drive).\nsudo vgreduce vg_blah /dev/sdxy\n\n\nAll credit goes to brianmcgee.\nNote: vgreduce will fail with cannot resize to xxxxx extents as later ones are allocated if you have another lv at the end of the disk - I had a swap lv, which I deleted. See How to shrink Ubuntu LVM logical and physical volumes? for help on that situation.\n\nA: You can shrink/extend a logical volume very easily with a GUI tool: system-config-lvm. Because system-config-lvm does not come pre-installed, once booted from a live-cd, you have to install it:\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) universe\"\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install system-config-lvm\n\nOnce it is installed, run the program, select the logical volume you want to change in the left panel, click 'Edit Properties'.\n\nNow change the parameters as you wish!\n\nOne good thing about system-config-lvm is that it won't allow you to go ahead if the new partition size is smaller than all your existing data combined (I've just tried this and seen for myself).\nReferences:\n\n\n*\n\n*How-To Geek tutorial (this is the origin of the images).\n\n*Red Hat's complete guide for the program.\n\n\nA: Note: You should run almost all of the following commands using a Live CD. Sometimes, it wants you to unmount the partition that already mounted on / (in this case, you cannot unmount it).\nThese are all the steps required to resize a LVM or LVM2 partition:\nsudo lvresize --verbose --resizefs -L -150G /dev/mapper/ubuntu\n\nsudo pvresize --setphysicalvolumesize {some-space} /dev/sda5\n\nIf the second command produces something like this:\n/dev/sda5: cannot resize to xxxxx extents as later ones are allocated.\n\nThen, you have to rearrange the unallocated space at the end of the LVM. That means after root and swap_1 partition. So, initially, you need to check physical volumes' information using the command below:\nsudo pvs -v --segments /dev/sda5\n\nThis will show the output like:\n/dev/sda5 ubuntu lvm2 a-- 698.04g 150g   0 xxx root 0 linear /dev/sda:0-rrr\n/dev/sda5 ubuntu lvm2 a-- 698.04g 150g xxx sss 0 free                          \n/dev/sda5 ubuntu lvm2 a-- 698.04g 150g zzz ttt swap 0 linear /dev/sda5:yyy-www\n\nNote the yyy-www. Use the following command to remove external fragmentation:\nsudo pvmove --alloc anywhere /dev/sda5:yyy-www\n\nNow, let us see how it goes:\nsudo pvs -v --segments /dev/sda5\n\nThis will show the output like (note the changes):\n/dev/sda5 ubuntu lvm2 a-- 698.04g 150g   0 xxx root 0 linear /dev/sda:0-rrr\n/dev/sda5 ubuntu lvm2 a-- 698.04g 150g xxx ttt swap 0 linear /dev/sda5:xxx-sss\n/dev/sda5 ubuntu lvm2 a-- 698.04g 150g yyy www 0 free\n\nAfter that, use the GParted and resize the LVM to maximum used area and rest will be in unallocated space. Enjoy...\n\nA: In addition to the @bigbadonk420's answer,\nInstead of doing the following:\nresize2fs -p /dev/vg_blah/lv_blah 9G\nlvreduce -L -1G /dev/vg_blah/lv_blah\n\nDo:\nlvreduce -r -L 9G /dev/vg_blah/lv_blah\n\nNote the -r which reduces the file system simultaneously and is safe.\n\nA: I would recommend another GUI tool - KVPM. It combines functionality of GParted and system-config-lvm. Moreover, it allows some operations on live (mounted) partitions that system-config-lvm  doesn't allow  However, the volume has to be unmounted for shrinking.\n\n\nIt is in universe repository since Ubuntu 12.04, so just do sudo apt-get install kvpm\nNote: start it with root rights sudo kvpm\n\nA: I found this answer by accident, but this worked for me at least.\nIn my case I had already a reserved unallocated disk space after the root, so I skip the part how you get more space and just explain how I used it on root without booting. \nNOTE: Instead of using gparted, you are probably better off using system-config-lvm. Next time I would use that one instead... My gparted version was 0.18.\n\n\n*\n\n*First I used gparted to extend root partition as much as I could. To my surprise it extended only the physical sizes and did nothing to the logical part. So df -k command said that the disk was full still.\n\n*lvresize -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/root extends the logical partition as far as it can. No need to check and calculate GBs or blocks in various methods.\n\n*resize2fs /dev/ubuntu-vg/root is then the third step I did: it extends the file system to the size of the logical partition.\n\n\nThe last step can be merged into the second:\nlvresize -l +100%FREE --resizefs /dev/ubuntu-vg/root\n\nA: Only the latest version of Gparted (0.14) supports resizing LVM physical volumes. The version that ships with Ubuntu 12.10 or 13.04 does not support it.\nHere's how to resize an LVM physical volume:\n\n\n*\n\n*If the volume group associated with the LVM physical volume does not have enough unallocated space, you'll need to make some by shrinking a logical volume. Look at bigbadonk420's answer for instructions on how to do that. You can also use GNOME Disks (included with Ubuntu) for some of the steps if you prefer a GUI.\n\n*Burn the latest .iso image from GParted's website, and burn it on a CD or put it on a USB stick. Boot from the CD or the USB stick. Alternatively, you could compile the latest version of GParted from source.\n\n*Use GParted to resize the LVM physical volume. GParted won't let you shrink the LVM physical volume to a size smaller than what the unallocated space allows.\n\nA: Warning about the currently most voted answer:\nTo NOT destroy your fresh default installation with LVM option (14.04 Trusty Tahr), 1) read the whole page, 2) delete swap 3) and probably modify the command for \"Reduce the size of the logical volume\" like this: \nlvreduce -L -1g /dev/vg_blah/lv_blah\n\nI strongly recommend system-config-lvm.\n", "Q: If I uninstall ubuntu, will Windows Boot Manager still be there? I want to get rid of my Ubuntu partition, because I never use it on my laptop, only on my desktop.\nIf I remove Ubuntu (I'm assuming GRUB will go with it), will Windows Boot Manager still allow me to boot into Windows, or will I need to do something else?\n\nA: Removing Ubuntu must be done carefully because you might mess up things with booting Windows.\nIf you simply delete the Ubuntu partition (assuming you have a Windows partition, an Ubuntu partition and a swap partition), Grub will most probably still be there but be messed up, not allowing you to boot Windows.\nLook here: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-safely-uninstall-ubuntu-in-windows-dual-boot-environment/\nIn short:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot Windows\n\n*Delete Linux partitions from within Windows\n\n*Restore MBR (to remove Grub and install the Windows bootloader) using bootrec /fixmbr bootrec /fixboot\n\n*Recover the space left by the Ubuntu partitions by creating a new NTFS partition or enlarging the Windows partiton.\n\nA: The short answer is you will lose access to Windows if you remove Ubuntu.\nThe Problem\nWhen you install Linux, it replaces the Windows MBR (Master Boot Record) with another one, GRUB.  The downside of using GRUB is that its configuration file lives in a Linux partition, usually the last Linux distribution installed.  So, if you delete this last distro, you lose GRUB's configuration files, and it will stop at a GRUB prompt that is pretty cryptic.  It's possible to enter commands here to boot Windows, or any other distro, but it's pretty painful, especially every time you boot.\nThe Solutions\nThe usual solution is to use the bootable Windows recovery disk to run a command to replace GRUB with the original Windows boot loader; this must be run from the CD/DVD or repair disk, and can't be run from Windows itself.  More info can be found here for Vista and Windows 7 or here for XP.\nIf you have a copy of the standard fdisk program for DOS/Windows, you can run fdisk /mbr to fix it.\nIf you don't have the required Windows boot disks, you may be able to fix it using these instructions.\n\nA: If you want to restore windows 7 bootloader then install \"EasyBcd\" on windows from here - http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/OS-Enhancements/EasyBCD.shtml\nAfter installing, open it.\nIf your screen shows like this - \nThen go to \"BCD Deployment\" -> Clik on \"Write MBR\"\n\nAfter reboot , login to windows, go to -> Disk Management.

Also USB Hard Disk should be before USB Floppy. \nHope this would work for you either.\n\nA: The only solution to your problem is Try again until it works!\nTo start with,there is a bug report about the problem you are facing at Launchpad.\nThe boot fail may be a result of many reasons.You could try:\n-> Check if the .iso image you downloaded is healthy.\n-> Format your USB drive and try burning the .iso file again\n-> Use onother burning program\n\nA: Try using the unetbootin program in ubuntu to make your USB bootable with ubuntu. Use your bios settings to select the USB device to boot afterwards.\nEDIT: Since I initially wrote this answer, I powered up a bit in knowledge. Word around the internet frowns upon unetbootin. Here is a list of random reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*no proper UEFI support\n\n*apparent issues with systemd\n\n*actually had some personal problems when making live cds of some more esoteric distros (like the late crunchbang)\n\n\nIf you have access to a Windows machine, like the other answer by AtariBaby, Rufus is your best bet. It supports variuous partition schemes and boot particularities.\nIf you have access to a GNU/Linux/Unix distro or toolset, use dd. It's probably the best way of cloning drives or burning images to them. User densmorea or reddit puts it better and gives a few links to tutorials on using dd.\nI'll also post the links here for future reference and alien explorers:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://linux.die.net/man/1/dd\n\n*https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/disk_cloning\n\nA: I was having a similar issue, loading form usb key would stop on 'syslinux 4.04....' \nI reformatted the usb key Startup Disk Creator on another computer and loaded the contents from iso I downloaded and it works for me, seems like the usb formatting was incorrect.\n\nA: I suggest making a bootable USB by using a tool called mkusb. I had the same error and mkusb managed to install ubuntu without problems.\nSimilar problem and solution discussed here.\n\nA: I use the UNEtBootin tool for that.\nThree steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the tool and install.\n\n*Start the programm and select the distribution you want (Fedora, etc.) and do not forget to select the correct drive (eg. f:) to install the os \n\n*Select ok. it will download the os for you and put it on the stick. Reboot on the usb stick and let the installation proceed.\n\n\nPS:\nYour computer sometimes might get into trouble finding your USB stick.\nIf this is the case, reformat the USB stick in FAT32 and retry.\n\nA: Did you test the MD5SUM of the .iso image used to create the live USB flash drive? (See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM, and note that if you are trying to install Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot, the relevant MD5 hashes are not yet at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes, so you'll have to use http://releases.ubuntu.com/oneiric/MD5SUMS.)\nIf that does not check out, then redownload the .iso image and try again (make sure to MD5 test the new .iso image, too).\nIf that checks out, and you are sure you are writing the USB flash drive using a correct procedure, then try writing it without any persistent storage. If that doesn't work, try writing it with the Universal USB Installer instead of UNetbootin, as described in Step 2 at http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download (click \"Show me how\").\nIf none of that works, you should make sure it's possible to boot from the USB flash drive on another computer (such as one belonging to a friend) to verify that it is physically OK, or try a different USB flash drive (if you have one), or try burning the .iso image (slowly, to minimize the chance of errors) to a CD or DVD.\n\nA: Impatience could be the problem here - it takes a very long time for ubuntu to leave that screen.\nFailing that, there are a few things you could try:\nYou could make a new USB. That would eliminate the USB as the problem, leaving ubuntu or the computer as the problem, if the computer still fails to boot.\nI noticed that at the end of the message you get a pre1. This could mean you are running an unstable, prerelease version of SYSLINUX. You could look for an older version of ubuntu and attempt to install that. (Try 10.04 LTS.) This should determine whether the error is ubuntu 12.04 or the computer (if it works with 10.04, then the problem is ubuntu.)\nFrom there I can attempt a few different things, but first run these tests and tell me what happens.\n\nA: One possible solution is to create your bootable USB using either Unetbootin, which works well on both Windows and Linux. Furthermore, if you are on linux you could try the dd command: sudo dd if=path/to/your/iso/here.iso of=/dev/sdb where /dev/sdb is the path to your usb drive.

I'm 3 years into using Ubuntu as my default OS, but I notice that Ubuntu is becoming slower after some weeks of installation.  On all the Ubuntu versions I have used including \"Ubuntu 10.10, 11.04, 11.10 and 12.04\", the boot becomes slower. When I make a fresh install, it boots in just 17 seconds... after 2 mouths, the system takes almost 1 minute to boot (Slower than Win7). I tried to disable all the software that starts with the System, but the problem continues (I had this problem with my older notebook, so it's not hardware related).\nUbuntu's boot looks inconsistent too, because sometimes I see the purple boot screen, sometimes I just can see an underline at the left-top side of screen. \nSo. Why is Ubuntu's boot going slower with time?  Can it be fixed?\n\nA: Depending on the applications you install these can all affect boot time.\nIt is an easy thing to diagnoise just install \nsudo apt-get install bootchart\n\nAfter you install and reboot look in /var/log/bootchart and evaluate your data.\n\nA: Anything that installs as a system service will be loaded every time you boot.  This includes things like the MySQL server, Apache server or any other server processes that install themselves system-wide.\nIf you have installed a lot of software like this it is going to affect boot time a bit.\n", "Q: If i upgrade my ubuntu to non-beta version, will my installed software lost? my software lost when i upgrade to ubuntu to 12.10 beta version. Will my software lost if i upgrade to non-beta version?\n\nA: If you upgrade from the CD/ISO all of your software will be removed as the Upgrade feature on the CD is actually just a reinstall without formatting. Your files will be kept intact.\nIf you upgrade using update manager, to a beta, alpha, pre-alpha or even a normal release, locally installed software will sometimes be determined by the system to no longer be needed and removed. Software(s) with unmet dependencies in the new distribution might also be removed during the upgrade to a beta version where the repository is still constantly changing.\n", "Q: Home folder in `root` and not in `home`... I'm confused! I have an issue with my home folder and this are giving me some permission problems.  \nI've installed an application that tells me that I have no permission to save in /home/username/Desktop, but in fact my home is in /home/username/Área de Trabalho (Área de Trabalho = Desktop, but in Portuguese).  \n\n\n*\n\n*Accessing as sudo my home is shown in the below image  (look at the folder icon).\n(Inside is the desktop folder.)  \n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Accessing as regular user my home is shown in the below image.\n(Inside is the Área de Trabalho folder.)  \n\n\n\nIs this normal? Should I tell Ubuntu where my actual home folder is? What I have to do?  \nThanx in advance!\n\nA: Yes it is normal\nsudo command opens the nautilus in root mode, root's home is root itself  \n\nA: Every different user has a different home directory.\nThey're all configured in the file /etc/passwd. You have to log out and back in after editing that file for the change to home folder to take effect.  Unless you're an advanced user, I wouldn't recommend editing this file anyway, but I mentioned it in case you're curious to view it and know how it works.\nThe \"root\" user's home directly is set by default to /root whereas ordinary users' home directories are set by default to /home/*username*. There's usually no good reason to move a home directory.\nWhen running a graphical program with root privileges using gksu/gksudo, your home directory will usually be reported as /root (this explains why). This is normal, and it's only because you're using root privileges (which you should rarely ever need to use once you've set everything up properly).\n\nA: The first screenshot (\"as sudo\") is shown in icon view, and the second screenshot (\"as regular user\") is in detailed list view, but they are actually showing the same folder structure. There is no discrepancy. (tachyons's answer explains why different folders have the house icon on them.) The detailed list view is giving you a bit more information; in particular, the folder called /home is expanded to reveal its contents, including the p_sardinha subfolder.\nSince the two views are equivalent, there's doesn't appear to be problem relating to how you are viewing your folder structure. Therefore we can break your question down into two parts:\n\n*\n\n*Where is my home folder?\n\n*How can I solve a problem where an application tries to access my desktop folder, but fails because it names that folder in the wrong language?\n\nWhere is my home folder?\nEvery human user of an Ubuntu system has a home folder (which is also called a home directory, since folder and directory mean the same thing). If you had user accounts set up on your Ubuntu system for more than one person, each one of them would have a separate home folder.\nThere is a folder called /home. That is not your home folder. In fact, that is never anyone's home folder. Rather, /home is the folder that contains human users' home folders.\nYour home folder is /home/p_sardinha, because your username is p_sardinha.\nMore generally, for a human user username, the user's home folder is /home/username.\n\n*\n\n*On some systems, including yours, the folder called /home contains a subfolder lost+found. This is not anyone's home folder. Instead, this exists by default in the root folder of ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystems; it is used to keep files that are recovered while repairing the filesystem, and it is not necessary for you to know anything about it, in order to use your home folder.\n\n\n*Some user accounts exist that do not correspond to actual human users of your computer. They exist so that certain programs can run with special identities, abilities, and restrictions appropriate for the tasks they are designed to perform. Non-human users generally do not have their home directories in /home. For example, as tachyons mentioned, the root user, which is the user actually running commands you run with sudo and gksu/gksudo (unless you use the -u flag) has /root as its home directory.\nOne of the reasons the distinction between the folder called /home and your actual home folder (which is a subfolder of that) is sometimes confusing, is that Nautilus (Ubuntu's file browser) calls your actual home folder \"Home.\" For example, this is the contents of my home folder, shown in Nautilus:\n\nThe actual name of that folder (whose contents are shown), however, is /home/ek (since my username is ek). My desktop folder is called Desktop and located within my home folder, so its fully qualified path is /home/ek/Desktop.\nHow can I solve a problem where an application tries to access my desktop folder, but fails because it names that folder in the wrong language?\nThere might be an application-specific solution, but you haven't provided details about the circumstances under which the error occurs or what application it's happening in, so I cannot provide such a solution. Fortunately, I can provide a general solution.\nSince folders are sometimes called something besides their real name (for example, your home folder is sometimes called Home even though its name is p_sardinha), first make sure that your desktop folder's name really is Área de Trabalho. It's easy to check this--just view the contents of your home folder (as I did, in the screenshot above), and make sure it's called that there. I believe you have already done this.\nSo the real full name of your desktop folder is /home/p_sardinha/Área de Trabalho. But at least one of your applications wants to access it at /home/p_sardinha/Desktop. Assuming there is not also a folder called /home/p_sardinha/Desktop (you should check to be sure), you should be able to solve the problem by creating a symbolic link called Desktop in your home folder, that points to Área de Trabalho (your actual desktop folder).\nTo create this symbolic link, open a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run these commands:\ncd\nln -s 'Área de Trabalho' Desktop\n\n\n*\n\n*The first command (cd, with nothing after it) makes sure the command-line you're using is \"in\" your home folder (that is, that it is using your home folder as its present working directory).\n\n*The second command (that starts with ln) actually creates the symbolic link.\n\nThat should solve the problem. However, your applications really should be internationalized sufficiently as not to assume your desktop folder is always called Desktop. Therefore, I recommend reporting a bug in the application in which the problem occurred, so the developers can make the application work as well for Portugese-speaking users as it does for English-speaking users.\n", "Q: Can I torrent a dvd and still try ubuntu I torrented the 64bit edition for my pc but the only option at boot was install ubuntu.

Just follow the tutorial.\nAfter you get everything going just setup your DNS and then your sites and users.  I usually use ssh/sftp over ftp since it is encrypted, but either should work once you create an account.  They should also all be in virtual hosts so no need to worry about wrong permissions.  Just make sure you keep them in the \"jail\" when creating the user account.  This will all make more sense once you play around with ISPConfig\n\nA: Apache supports per-user web directories. This in combination with per user quotas (should be fairly easy to google), and an ftp server should do the trick.\nIn order to only access the home folder, I guess you could assign /bin/false as the user's shell. This disables SSH access. Then only the ftp server needs to be configured. That configuration depends on what kind of ftp server you will be using.\nDisclaimer: I haven't tried this, but this would be my first approach. Anyone feel free to enlighten me :)\n", "Q: How do you open a command line? How do you access the command line or run option to put the commands into the system?\n\nA: It is called terminal. \n\nYou can launch your terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T or search from dash by pressing Meta/Super/Windows button and type terminal. \nIf you're using Gnome, Terminal is probably under Accessories in your Application menu, or you can also try Alt F2 to bring up a launcher widget into which you can type \"t-e-r-m-i...\" to see all the terminal options.\n\nBasic command line.\nEnjoy your command line ! \n\nA: Press Ctrl Alt T on the keyboard. If you prefer, there should be something called Terminal in your programs menu. You can search for it by pressing \"Windows\" key and typing \"terminal\". Remember, commands in Linux are case sensitive (so upper- or lower-case letters matter).\n\nA: Command line can be accessed in couple of ways.\nOne is by using terminal emulator . The default terminal emulator for Ubuntu ( with default Unity interface ) is gnome-terminal. It can be accessed by either pressing CtrlAltT or by pressing the Ubuntu icon on the launcher and typing in the word \"Terminal\" or \"gnome-terminal\"\n\nAs you can see in the image, I've multiple terminal apps available, and indeed one can install more than one terminal emulator.\nAnother way to access command line is through the virtual console, called TTY. There are 6 virtual consoles available. Number of each console corresponds to the number of Fx key, where x is the number. For instance, to access TTY1, press CtrlAltF1 . To return to graphical environment , press AltF7, or repeatedly press AltArrow Left/Right until you exit.\nThere are other, rather hackish ways to access command line , but for the 99% of the day-to-day tasks terminal emulator and tty are sufficient. \nNote , when it comes to command-line, terminology may get confusing. \n\nA: There are some great terminal programs like yakuake and guake that will put a drop-down terminal on your screen whenever you hit f12. I find them a little more elegant than opening a new terminal each time if you do a lot of command-line work.\n", "Q: Ubuntu Display Issues I installed 12.04 about 3 days ago. I was not very happy with the results,  when I start, it takes a lot of time. I have also display problems. For example, the movement of windows, the selection box, the movement of mouse pointer.\nMy colleague who recommended me to install Ubuntu told me that it requires many fewer requirements than Windows (XP in my case). \nBut anyway, when I installed Ubuntu, I installed it with the first option of the installer. I think that option says, \"install Ubuntu, but keep Windows\" or something, and asked me to allocate an amount of storage on my hard drive for each OS. I allocated 247 GB for Windows and 80 GB for Ubuntu. \nI want to know if I can uninstall Ubuntu, and get back the storage allocated to it, return to Windows, along with those 80 GB, or just help me with these display issues. \nI hope you understand me, I need help fast.\n\nA: You've described a problem in Ubuntu where your graphical user interface is slow and not sufficiently responsive. Usually it is possible to solve this problem by changing interfaces from Unity to Unity 2D.\nTo do this, go to the login screen. (If you are currently logged in, log out.)\nClick on the Ubuntu logo near your name. A drop-down menu comes up. One of the items--which is probably currently selected--is called Ubuntu. Another is called Ubuntu 2D. Select that. Then log in.\nOnce you've logged in once with Ubuntu 2D as your session type, it will be remembered, and you'll log in that way in the future (unless you manually set it back to Ubuntu or something else).\nWith the Ubuntu 2D session type, the GUI does not use 3D graphics acceleration. On computers without fast video cards, this improves performance.\nI hope that solves your problem, and that Ubuntu works well for you from now on. However, if you do decide to remove Ubuntu, you can do that, and the hard disk space taken from your Windows system can be given back to it.

I'm happily using Ubuntu but I'm wondering if there's a way to do a fresh install of just Ubuntu and wipe the hard drive completely with this unique setup where Ubuntu is attached to Windows but I can't get into Windows?\n\nA: Yes, and for that you'll need to make an Ubuntu installation CD/USB (also known as Live CD/USB), and boot from it.

For example, open the \"Dash\" (hit the \"Windows\" button if you have it on your keyboard) and type \"Startup Disk Creator\", and you should see a program icon below for the utility to upload the downloaded image to the flash drive. You may also make a bootable USB from Windows and from MAC OS X.\nThis helps with computers that do not have a CD or DVD drive, and also appears to be a faster installation.

Find out what format the\n  other MUA uses, and when it's compatible, just copy them over to a\n  place for mutt to find them (and configure it per MuttGuide/Folders).\n  If it's a proprietary format, either use the MUAs own export function,\n  or search the web for external tools which can convert to a\n  mutt-usable format, and proceed as before with configuring mutt to\n  find them.\n\n\nA: It is definitely possible to do all the things you want to do with Mutt, and much more. \nMultiple accounts are possible with Mutt. Personally I have only used multiple gmail imap accounts, as described in this article here, but it is feasible to set them up and move between them. It is not necessary to repeat the information here, but it has a lot to do with how the 'account hooks' and 'folder hooks' are set up; the article explains it well.\nHowever, you can achieve it without folder-hooks: see my answer here:\n\n\n*\n\n*How to manage multiple imap accounts with mutt\nTo navigate between folders, you can use macros, as these well known ones demonstrate: \nmacro index,pager gi \"<change-folder>=INBOX<enter>\" \"Go to inbox\"\nmacro index,pager ga \"<change-folder>=[Gmail]/All Mail<enter>\" \"Go to all mail\"\n\nMore on how to move between folders and how messages can be moved across folders is explained here in great detail.\nIndeed, messages can be exported from Thunderbird in the mbox format and then read in Mutt, as the Mutt wiki notes here. It will be necessary to install the Thunderbird import/export addon and then export the folders from Thunderbird in mbox format and then specify the folder in the .muttrc, by refering to these notes.\nReferring to your question in the comments: When you load up your inbox or when you switch between folders Mutt by default only loads the headers from the server, which I think is what you want. It only downloads the actual message when you click return to view the message. Hence, why we cache headers and messages for performance, and usually most people have standard entries like this in the .muttrc:\nset header_cache=~/.mutt/cache/headers\nset message_cachedir=~/.mutt/cache/bodies\n\nFor offline availability, you may need to pair Mutt with another program called offlineimap, which is available in the repositories; a discussion is available here and here.\nI've put these hints together (from the wiki and my own personal rc) into a rough muttrc but you may have to test and modify it for your own purposes, and obviously add your own details, but it should be a useful starting point.\n", "Q: How to show just one Drive in Unity bar I have two partitions and both are appearing in nautilus.

Just read this seriously obsessive post about customising keyboards and while I'm not going to do everything there, there are a couple of ideas I'd like to nick. In particular he has set up the Caps Lock key so that:\n\n\n*\n\n*when pressed and released alone, it is mapped to Esc\n\n*when pressed and held, and a second key is pressed, it is mapped to Ctrl\nAs he says, this is great for vim users. Is that possible in Ubuntu?\nHe also does something similar with the right and left Shift keys. When pressed alone they map to ( and ) but if another key is pressed they act as you expect Shift to work.\n\nA: I found an answer on unix.se at least to the Caps Lock/Ctrl/Esc part.\nFirst remap Caps Lock to an extra Control by putting the following in ~/.profile\nif [ $DISPLAY ]\nthen\n  # Add the 3 lines below to Convert caps-lock into Control\n  xmodmap -e 'remove Lock = Caps_Lock'\n  xmodmap -e 'keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L'\n  xmodmap -e 'add Control = Control_L'\n\n  # and xcape is in Startup Applications\nfi\n\nThen go get xcape - you'll need to install the dependencies (see the README) and do make and sudo make install. And then it does what the README says:\n\nxcape runs as a daemon and intercepts the Control key. If the Control key is pressed and released on its own, it will generate an Escape key event.\n\nI'm using it now and it's very nice :)\nI guess a modified version could do the shift/parentheses thing as well.\n\nA: On Ubuntu 16.04\n1st Option\nCaps_Lock as Ctrl\n\n\n*\n\n*open the file /etc/default/keyboard, and change XKBOPTIONS=\"\" to:\nXKBOPTIONS=\"caps:ctrl_modifier\"\n\nCaps_Lock as Esc\n\n\n*\n\n*install xcape with\nsudo apt install xcape\n\n\n*create .xsessionrc at the home directory (or edit if it already exist) \n\n*add the following line to ~/.xsessionrc\n#!/bin/bash\n\n/usr/bin/xcape -e 'Caps_Lock=Escape'\n\nNote\n\n\n*\n\n*you need to logout then login.\n\n*for a full list of all the options that you can set in (1), check the ! options section in\n/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/*.lst\n\n\n2nd Option\nyou can use the following script to get the same behavior in a session.\n#!/bin/sh\n\n# Super Caps\n\n/usr/bin/setxkbmap -option 'caps:ctrl_modifier'  # rebind Caps_Lock to Ctrl, when held down, accomapgnied with other button\n/usr/bin/xcape -e 'Caps_Lock=Escape'             # rebind Caps_Lock to Esp, when tapped alone\n\n\n\n*\n\n*put the above content in a file, in any location\n\n\ne.g. custom_capslock in ~/.local/bin/\n\n\n*make it executable\n chmod a+x custom_capslock\n\n\n*add it to Startup Applications, by adding the FULL PATH of the script to Command field.\ne.g /home/yourname/.local/custom_capslock\nPS: if you want to use systemd or /etc/rc.local instead of \"Startup Applications\", make sure that your script didn't get overridden by other system services\n", "Q: Thunderbird 16 and Lightning I have just upgraded from Thunderbird 15 to 16 and then found that Lightning 1.7 is not compatible with Thunderbird 16, leaving me without a calendar. \nWhat are my options? \nShould I try and go back to Thunderbird 15 or is there someway of finding a version of Lightning that is compatible with Thunderbird 16? \nI need to have a working calender and have been happily using Lightning for many years.\nI am using Ubuntu 12.04 (precise) 32-bit if that is any help\n\nA: Lightning 1.8 has been uploaded\nhttps://launchpad.net/~mozillateam/+archive/thunderbird-next \nppa:mozillateam/thunderbird-next  (Click here for instructions on using PPAs.)\nLightning 1.8 should also be pushed out with Thunderbird 16 when it is released to the main archive (with the exception of 10.04 which will need to go to lucid-backports and might lag behind a day or 2)\n\nA: You can try the Thunderbird Add-on 'Disable Add-on Compatibility Checks' to bypass this problem.  \nThis is a workaround though, realize that once you do this you may introduce bugs with Thunderbird or your Add-ons.  \nIt's a good idea to keep a backup of your Thunderbird profile to restore from if anything breaks or fails.

Instead I have to select Advanced options for Ubuntu and the newest Kernel Version and then the boot starts.\nAny ideas?\nThanks a lot in advance\nJohannes\n\nA: I'm not sure what this \"Advanced options\" you refer to is; I don't recall such a thing on my GRUB menus. Is this something in your motherboard's firmware? If so, it could be that GRUB has gotten \"lost\" from the firmware's NVRAM. (Under UEFI, the NVRAM holds boot loader data and the firmware can present its own boot manager menu. Unfortunately, most firmware implementations have pretty awful boot managers. This system also means that if the NVRAM gets reset or changed, your boot loader may fail to launch.)\nYou can edit your firmware's NVRAM boot loader settings with the efibootmgr utility in Linux. You can use it something like this:\nsudo efibootmgr -c -l \\\\EFI\\\\ubuntu\\\\grub.efi -L Ubuntu\n\nThis adds the boot loader stored at EFI/ubuntu/grub.efi on the EFI System Partition (ESP) to the NVRAM, giving it the title Ubuntu. You might need to change these details for your system, of course. Note the use of the doubled-up backslashes as directory separators; this is a requirement. Ordinarily, Ubuntu mounts the ESP at /boot/efi, so this example would add the Linux file /boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/grub.efi as a boot loader. Check to see if this file, or one like it, is present on your system.\nSince you say you're using a UEFI-based computer, you should not install the grub-pc package, as Kalle Elmér suggested; that's the BIOS version of GRUB, and if your system is (or was) booting in UEFI mode, installing the BIOS version of GRUB will at best do nothing useful and at worst it will create a mess that will be harder to fix.\n\nA: You might want to try reinstalling grub. You can do so with this command:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-pc\n\nJag leave things at their default and make sure that your hard drive is selected.\nThis is probably a long-shot, but worth a try.\n", "Q: PCman filemanager displays old data on USB mounted drive When I plug in usb flash drive, or even my camera and open File Manager only old data that was previously on usb drive (or Camera's memory card) is shown.

Is there a way to create identifiable Byobu sessions so that when I've got multiple sessions running, the byobu-select-session menu gives me a list of sessions I can recognize, as opposed to non-descript tmux port numbers?\nIn an ideal world, it would be great to be able to both start a session giving it a name and to modify such a session to change a name if it's already running?

I'm surprised byobu -S \"name\" isn't liked to tmux new -s session_name for byobu with a tmux backend.\n\n\nA: Byobu is simply a shell for the tmux (or screen) back end terminal multiplexor. You can therefore pass any command that your back end supports through Byobu.\nByobu with tmux back end\nTo start a new Byobu session with a specified name:\nbyobu new -s <session-name>\n\nTo change the name of a pre-existing session:\nbyobu rename -t <session-name> <new-session-name>\n\nByobu with screen back end\nTo start a new Byobu session with a specified name:\nbyobu -S <session-name>\n\nTo change the name of a pre-existing session:\nbyobu -X <session-name> <new-session-name>\n\nNote: All credit to J.F.Sabastian for his help.

However, the original developer, Enrico Ros, does note at his site that two universities are working on some elements of a future version 1.\nNevertheless, fotowall is a very useful program for creating collages; many different canvas sizes and layouts can be used and the pictures added to that canvas can be resized and arranged in many different ways. Text can be added, for example, to the base of pictures or you can have separate text boxes anywhere on your canvas. \nSpecial effects like shadow or blur can also be turned on or off for each picture. It is possible to control how the pictures overlap and which ones are brought to the foreground or sent to the background. If you select a photo you can even warp it so it appears 3d- just click a photo and then click the red dot you can see in the top toolbar (as in the screenshot), and move it off axis. I find that it's best to just experiment and see what's possible with the program. \n\nYou can save the canvas as a .fotowall document, which you can continue working on later, or click the export button at the top right of the screen and then save it as an image, a wallpaper, or print directly from the program. The full list of options can be seen in the screenshot below; you may notice that there is no option to export as pdf, but that's no problem as you can just use imagemagick and run convert myfotowall.bmp myfotowall.pdf and specify any options if you need to.\n\n\nA: You can use any application for managing pictures : GIMP, Inkscape (just like Kalle said), Pinta (how to install)...\n\nI Saw this link ,but couldn't find any of them in my Ubuntu software\n  center or the instructions to add the PPA to get them.\n\nPicture2Life, Photovisi and Fotonea can be used only on the website. Picasa for Linux does not exist anymore. You can download Shape Collage here. For Linux, you can use the Java version or download the tarball (they no longer use Java).\n\nA: A solid application that I found for creating collages is called Fotowall.  Easy to use, versitile and quick.  It also was eay to use.  Here is the link if anyone wants more information.\n", "Q: Is it possible to save ssh password in remmina?

Although they've been promising for a long time.  There are alternative available, but not as good.  As much as I hate saying this, but the only way at this point in time is either Windows or Mac.\n\nGoogle Earth has received so much press coverage that many users will\n  appreciate that it is one of the coolest applications to download. In\n  brief, it is a feature-laden 3D virtual globe, map and geography\n  browser which lets users zoom in on their world with fantastic detail.\n  View satellite imagery, maps, terrain, 3D buildings and even explore\n  galaxies in the sky. This application allows the exploration of rich\n  geographical content, save toured places and share with others. The\n  software maps the earth by the superimposition of images obtained from\n  satellite imagery, aerial photography and GIS 3D globe.\nGoogle Earth is undoubtedly a very impressive application, and it is\n  extremely hard not to admire the wealth of features that it offers.\n  Its satellite images are unrivaled, it provides useful and accurate\n  statistical information, and the software has many practical benefits,\n  such as helping to find locations and give driving directions. In\n  terms of functionality, this application earns our highest praise. We\n  use the software on a regular basis on both desktop and mobile devices\n  (the latter under Android). However, whilst Google Earth is available\n  to download without charge, Google do not release the software under\n  an open source license. There are a number of applications which are\n  credible open source alternatives to Google Earth. Whilst none of the\n  software applications featured in this article have all of the\n  features offered by Google Earth (although some offer some different\n  features), and they are not exactly comparable, they are all worthy of\n  investigating.\nWorld Wind Virtual globe initially developed by NASA's Learning\n  Technologies project\nMarble Combination atlas/virtual globe\nVirtual Ocean Integrates the GeoMapApp tool suite with the NASA\n  World Wind 3-D earth browser\nossimPlanet Accurate 3D global geo-spatial viewer\nGeoMapApp Earth science exploration, global topography database,\n  and visualization\nOpenStreetMap A copyright free alternative to Google Maps\n\nI hope that Google will support Linux for the plugin too.

I would like to add one comment in case people have the problem that I just did: when you use this type definition to set string values, you need to pass in some extra quotes and escape characters.  For instance, I wanted to set my color scheme in gedit, so I tried this:\ndconf::key {'/org/gnome/gedit/preferences/editor/scheme':\n    value => 'solarized_dark',\n}\n\nbut it didn't work.  What I needed to do was this:\ndconf::key {'/org/gnome/gedit/preferences/editor/scheme':\n    value => \"\\\\\\\"solarized_dark\\\\\\\"\",\n}\n\nMaybe someone could do that in a simpler way, or build it into the function you provided?  Anyway, it works for me now so I'm leaving it alone.\nNote that passing in booleans works fine without that extra nonsense, e.g.:\ndconf::key {'/org/gnome/gedit/preferences/editor/auto-indent': \n    value => 'true',  \n}\n\nworks correctly, and I'm assuming that numerical values can probably be set without extra escape characters as well.\n\nA: I managed to solve the problem:\ndefine dconf::key($value) {\n    exec { \"Setting dconf $title\":\n        path => \"/bin:/usr/bin\",\n        command => \"/bin/sh -c 'eval `dbus-launch --auto-syntax` && dconf write $title $value'\",\n        user => \"user_name\",\n        group => \"user_name\",\n        unless => \"dconf read $title | grep $value\",\n        require => Package[\"dconf-tools\"]\n    }\n}\n\n\nA: I have created a puppet module for that, based on Joril's answer:\nhttps://github.com/sitaktif/puppet-dconf\nAs user153385 mentions, it needs escaping because of the use of sh. Examples with bool, string and array are given in the README.md of the repository.\n\nA: I use the similar, but slightly simplified defined type to solve this problem:\ndefine dconf ($key = $title, $value) {\n    exec { \"dbus-run-session -- dconf write \\\"${key}\\\" \\\"${value}\\\"\":\n        onlyif  => \"test \\\"${value}\\\" != \\\"`dbus-run-session -- dconf read \\\"${key}\\\"`\\\"\",\n    }\n}\n\nThe above doesn't include the ability to be run by a particular user (although that could easily be added).  However, it does use a different invocation of dbus-run-session that doesn't leave extra dbus daemons running after the command completes and it removes the need for a separate sh -c layer (although this benefit could also be achieved with dbus-launch <command>).  This eliminates the painful multiple-layers of escaping mentioned by some of the other answers.\nSome examples that use the above:\n# swap capslock and escape\ndconf { '/org/gnome/desktop/input-sources/xkb-options':\n    value   => '[\\'caps:swapescape\\']',\n}\n\n# stop ibus from swallowing ctrl+space\ndconf { '/desktop/ibus/general/hotkey/triggers':\n    value   => '@as []',\n}\n\n\nA: I found a temporary solution: \n\n\n*\n\n*Login into the remote system, then connect via ssh terminal to the remote system and export display via: export DISPLAY=:0. \n\n*Now you can use \"dconf\" as usual via ssh terminal. But the gconftool-2 doesn't work now. \nDo you have a better solution working for dconf without exporting display ? \n", "Q: Ubuntu Studio 12.04 won't boot  \nPossible Duplicate:\nUbuntu 12.04 boot only when USB drive is connected \n\nI'll warn ye first off I'm still relatively new to Ubuntu and Linux. \nI installed Ubuntu Studio on a spare hard-drive (formatted beforehand etc.).

My laptop unplugged stands 1 minute. Previous week my laptop cable, started not connecting good with the laptop.\nI would like to play a certain sound everytime it gets's unplugged so I can hurry and connect them good.. Anyone?\n\nA: As explained in this answer, you have to:\n\n\n*\n\n*cd into your home folder and create the directory .local/share/sounds:\ncd && mkdir -p .local/share/sounds\n\n\n*cd into the newly created directory:\ncd .local/share/sounds\n\n\n*place the desired sound inside the directory, renaming it as power-unplug.wav (for example in this way):\nln -s /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Noise.wav power-unplug.wav\n\n\n*test the event with:\ncanberra-gtk-play -i power-unplug\n\nI suppose that, at this point, you have to logout and log back in to have the event work properly. Try it and see if it works. You can find more events and sound names here.\n\nA: On my Ubuntu 16.04 system, the sounds didn't fire in response to the actual events, although they would play from the test.\nEventually I wrote a script: ~/checkpower.sh\n#! /bin/bash\necho \"monitoring\"\npower=$(cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/status)\nwhile true; do\n  actual=$(cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/status)\n  # echo $actual\n  if [ $actual != $power ]; then\n     power=$actual\n     echo $actual\n  fi\n  if [ $actual == \"Discharging\" ]; then\n     echo \"discharging\"\n     /usr/bin/speaker-test --frequency 2000 --test sine -p 1 -P 2 -l 1\n  fi\n\n  sleep 10\ndone\n\nchmod +x ~/checkpower.sh\nAnd setup a service: /etc/systemd/system/checkpower.service\n[Unit]\nDescription=Check to see if battery is discharging and warn user\n\n[Service]\nType=simple\nExecStart=/home/<myusername>/checkpower.sh\n#in this line specify the path to the script.\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nObviously, change <myusername> to your actual username or change that path to wherever you put the script. Should probably be in /usr/bin. Then:\nsudo systemctl start checkpower\nand then unplug the laptop... wait until it screams. I could systemctl status checkpower to see the echos and errors. 'q' out of the status and go back in to update. There is probably a better way to do that.\nSo once that worked, (and I had to change the BAT1 to BAT0 on mine) then I did a\nsudo systemctl enable checkpower\nand it seems to be working ok.\nThings I wanted to do and couldn't:\n\n*\n\n*aplay, canberra-gtk-play all that stuff won't work when running as a service.

What's a lot less solid is the actual permissions. They just aren't being set consistently the way we need them to get set and I haven't found the right solution.\nI do have the sticky bit set (g+s) based on something else I read at some point, but that wouldn't seem to be particularly useful since all users are in the same primary group.\nI also have the default umask set to 002 in /etc/login.defs. I thought that would kind of cover it, that doesn't seem to be the case.\nI'd really appreciate any advice about how to get everything lined up properly. I feel like I'm constantly in there adjusting a file here and a directory there just so people can do their work.\n\nA: Ok, for point 1, the solution is quite easy:\nchgrp developers /opt/dev\n\nFor points 2 and 3, I suppose you'll need ACL. So, the first thing to do is to edit /etc/fstab to give the option acl to the mountpoint of /opt/dev. If /opt/dev is not on a separate partition you'll need to enable ACL for the whole root filesystem.\nThen you'll have to follow this answer.\nchmod g+s /opt/dev\n\nshould be equivalent to chgrp developers /opt/dev (and doesn't set the sticky bit, s sets the suid bit).\nThen proceed with setfacl:\nsetfacl -d -m g::rwx /opt/dev  //set group to rwx default \nsetfacl -d -m o::rx /opt/dev   //set other\n\nto set advanced permission criteria for files and directories.

Opera. Get that and turn on what it calls \"Turbo boost\". What this setting does is reduce the size of webpages from %30-%80 (hence load times and memory consumption) by processing reduced quality images that are slightly blurrier. You can also turn on an additional setting called \"Load plugins only on demand\" which is another setting that greatly reduces memory consumption by not running plugins on pages like Youtube except on your terms (you click a play button to allow it when you're ready).\nIf you're having trouble finding these options then google them. Opera has its own 'user's manual' kind of page explaining its settings and options and where to find them.\n\nA: If midori still needs to much memory, you may test dillo.\n\nA: Assuming you're interested on a graphical browser, you can try the Dillo browser, which is available on the dillo package (screenshots).\nI don't think it supports JavaScript or plug-ins, I think it supports CSS and HTML 4 which should be fine for simple websites.\n\nA: You might be interested in Links2.

I am using Ubuntu 12.04 .while looking around terminal and i came across two things . one is xterm and xterm(Unicode) , may i know what the difference between these two things ? \n\nA: The question posted by maythux provides some valuable alternatives to either of the terminal emulators you mentioned.\nLike devav2, I assume you are talking about uxterm when you mention xterm(unicode).\nxterm is a very old terminal emulator for the X server system. In fact it is the original X terminal emulator from the 1980's. Unicode is a method of encoding into digital form all of the symbols used by people to communicate when they use their native languages.\nPrograms that have been fully internationalized, meaning fully able to process any language, will output in unicode rather than ASCII. Even if you are using ASCII or Latin as your native script unicode will work since they encode the same. Other systems of symbols may not be compatible. \nStill more systems of symbols will only work with unicode.\nBecause it is taking a while for programs on every platform to be converted to use unicode some programs do not output it. If you are using such program and unicode is giving you a problem with uxterm, straight xterm may work better.\nThe gnome-terminal program many use also supports the output of unicode, but that can be changed by changing an option.\nFor more information on unicode you may find this wikipedia page useful.\n", "Q: how to kill an app started by `quickly run` I am building an app and it hangs on some thread . how can i kill that app ?\ntried ctrl+c but it didn't work (the icon stays in the notification area)\nthanks\n\nA: Try to kill it via the process list:\n\nOr - if you want to be more nerdy - kill it via the console, using $>top\n\nA: If you know the name of your process, grep against ps to get the PID (process ID).

Obviously you should back up your data, but in my case backing up 6TB isn't really feasible. Therefore, I was willing to take the risk. There were a lot of vulnerability points to this process and it takes a long time. I'd urge you to only do this with data you either have backed up or can easily recreate.\n\nA: Well, you have RAID5 on 6 2TB disks which gives you 10TB usable space, 50% of which is used by data - that's 5TB you have to put somewhere. I don't think you can do this any other way without having additional disks. Which doesn't really help you.\nHowever I wanted to note one thing - you'll be moving part of this dataset to a single disk, which gives you no redundancy and after that you'll be resizing the raid5 set which may result in its corruption in the process.\nFrom what you plan to do and the constraints you described I understood you do not have a backup of this dataset. Are you sure you want to do it this way without first moving the data somewhere else?

The most possible cause of this failing is losing Windows.  (It was indeed the case as OP confirmed in a comment). \nI suggest to use Window 7 disk to repair Windows boot issue and then use the Live CD to fix grub \nHope this will fix the problem.\n\nA: The problem is there are several possible install modes.  UEFI, EFI, and standard.   Basically standard is what you get if you shift around your partitions so you can make the grub boot partition one of the first things on disk.\nAfter much experimentation I have found the best way to get everything working is you need both a GPT and an MBR partition table.   The reason being if you installed Windows without using UEFI, then it will only be able to read the MBR partition table while booting.  While grub will need to read the GPT partition table.  In this scenario, you must not install Linux using UEFI mode.  With modern bioses, you will see the DVDRAM listed twice.  Once with UEFI and once without UEFI.  You want to use the without UEFI to install your Linux distribution.   However, before installing you will need to prepare your disk.  I am assuming you have already resized your partions to make room and created a recovery disk from Windows.  Start off with just the standard MBR partition table.  If and only if your install complains you need GPT then do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*In a terminal run (Replace /dev/sda with whatever drive you are using.)\n$ su -\n# fdisk /dev/sda\nprint  (Be sure to write this down, or take readable screenshot with your camera.)\nquit\n# gdisk /dev/sda\nw\n# fdisk /dev/sda\nNow the hard part, you need to delete the gpt partion recreate the partition table you saw above.  Be sure your windows partition is active.\n\n*It might not be necessary, but to be on the safe side, reboot.\n\n*Using the live dvd/cd, go ahead and install.\n\n*At this point your linux partition will boot.  Windows should be recognized as well but probably won't boot yet...\n\n*Once logged into linux, run fdisk to see if your partition table still exists.  If not recreate it.\n\n*Now take your windows recovery disk (the one created when you backed up your system).  And boot from it.\n\n*The windows recovery disk should find your windows system and offer you the option to repair the boot.   Do so.\n\n*Now you should find that both Windows and your Linux system boot normally.\n\n\nNote: I have only tried this procedure using Fedora 17. It may well turn out that there are problems unique to Ubuntu.\n", "Q: Kubuntu 12.10 Shortcut to Restart X Server?

Using Ubuntu 12.04.\nI'd like to know if it is possible to set a different password for Ubuntu screensaver or not?\n\nA: It is possible.

There is this howto that show you how to set it up in Ubuntu. Once setup you can create a dummy user on your machine and set whatever password you want for the screensaver through that user.

How to use it? My PC has 8 Gb of ram. Is there any way to make ubuntu use most of it? I mean rarely drop caches and keep once opened programms in ram longer, preload apps on boot, etc.\n\nA: You could make a ramdisk for certain directories using tmpfs\nFor example for the ~/.cache/ directory, which google chrome and chromium use to cache data, the entry in /etc/fstab would be:\ntmpfs /home/your_username/.cache tmpfs defaults,size=1024M 0 0\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the contents get lost with each reboot.\nAnther suitable directoriy might be /tmp. Note that you can specify the size of the tmpfs in absolute or relative (to your RAM) values:\nUse 1G of your RAM:\ntmpfs /tmp tmpfs nosuid,size=1G 0 0\n\nor, use 10% of your available RAM:\ntmpfs /tmp tmpfs nosuid,size=10% 0 0\n\n\nA: Preloading should be easy enough -- since linux caches/buffers as much as possible, simply cat the libs/binaries you want to \"preload\" to /dev/null -- that should warm up the cache. Start a script like the following at boot:\n#/bin/bash\nPROGS=(\"/usr/bin/jiha\" \"/usr/bin/doho\")\nfor i in \"${PROGS[@]}\"; do \n    cat $i > /dev/null\n    for j in $(ldd \"$i\"); do  # this does not work -- need to filter ldd output (awk)\n        cat $j > /dev/null\n    done\ndone\n\nThis will waste a lot of time by cat'ing some libraries again and again, it is a bit more complicated to preload the needed libraries only once - but the impact depends on the length of the PROGS-array.\nThe rest (rarely drop caches, ...) is pretty much taken care of by the system by default -- it takes what it can use and let it go only if need be.\nHTH\n", "Q: Stucked in the grub command prompt I have a windows xp os, and I ve decided to give ubuntu a shot.

If I select rescue mode in GRUB, ssh is not run. I have to type start ssh to have it running. Can I made this be done automatically for me?\nTypical situation is with broken graphics, when I need to login to the box remotely. Now, I have to type start ssh blindly first and hope.\n\nA: When your system starts into the rescue mode, it uses the so called single user mode. This is runlevel 1. You'll find all programs which start here in /etc/rc1.d (starting with S).\nYou have to add ssh to runlevel 1. You can do this by making a symlink from /etc/init.d/ssh to /etc/rc1.d/S99ssh. The command update-rc.d assists you here. If you need a graphical program you can use bum (boot up manager).\n", "Q: Synchronizing Thunderbird15.0.1-Contacts with cardDAV-Server without using SOGO-Connector I have my own server (running 12.04) on which I installed ownCloud and were able to successfully synchronize my  Calendar via CalDAV. But when trying to synchronize my contacts with CardDAV, nothing worked. Everywhere I searched, all I could find was using SOGO-Connector which didn't work at all.\nBy the way: One thing SOGO-Connector did, was asking me twice for my master password every time I started Thunderbird.\nIs this an ownCloud-specific (v. 4.04) problem?\nIf anyone has a solution wihout ownCloud or without cardDAV in general, this is fine, but it shouldn't store my contact data anywhere else than on my server (that means no cloud storage solution).\nIt may help to know, that I have a working SparkleShare synchronisation.\nEDIT: Now using Radicale instead of ownCloud but with the same problems.\n\nA: The Cardbook addon completely replaces Thunderbird's built-in address book and provides support for CardDAV. It directly connects to your server using URL, username and password -- no data leakage (as far as I can tell without having checked the sources). This seems to work fine with my own Radicale server.\nNota bene: If you use HTTPS with a server that does not have a valid certificate (in particular a self-signed one) you need to add an exception for that server in Thunderbird's certificate configuration dialogue first. Otherwise, Cardbook will just report failed validation of the login credentials.\n\nA: I found a solution for my own problem:\n\n\n*\n\n*Installing Evolution and adding the CardDAV-adressbook\n\n*Installing EDS Contact Integration into Thunderbird\n\n\nThat's it, wasn't that hard.\nOnly problem: You have to specify an email account at least once to setup evolution (can be removed later).\n\nA: Another workaround in my special case:\nThe personal adressbook integrated in thunderbird is located in a file called abook.mab. Synchronizing this file with the help of a symlink and SparkleShare synchronizes my adressbook without using CardDAV.\n", "Q: Browsers are lagging when trying to load some webpages I'm facing a problem both on firefox (no addons) & Chrome (on Ubuntu 12.04). \nSome sites like Facebook, Ask Ubuntu and Deviant Art are not loading even after 10-15 minutes. Other sites are running quite well (I can play YouTube videos, for example), so the problem seems to be webpage-specific.\nWhat can I do about this?\n\nA: Try to remove your browser cache, in Firefox by selecting \"Extras\" → \"Remove newest history\". Make sure, that all the ticks are selected.\nIt's possible that your computer loaded the webpages wrongly\n\nA: When random sites are working while others are not I always check for MTU issue (or PMTU discovery) first.

I thought that/sdb refers to a second physical hard drive - but there is only one hard drive in this computer. Or is the problem something completely different?

When I first downloaded it, I think that grub2 became the boot master instead of the windows 7 bootloader.  Every time I tried to boot windows 7, it would fail.  The windows 7 disk didn't come with my desktop, so I couldn't find a way to fix it.  I like ubuntu more though so I'm ok with that.

Any Ideas?\n\nA: You could give SystemRescueCD a try: http://www.sysresccd.org/Download\nThe idea is to boot a LiveCD to allow to manipulate the HDD partitions without having any partition mounted. This LiveCD comes with GParted so you should be familiar with the rest of the resizing procedure.\nHTH,\nSimon\n\nA: Creating a new partition table will destroy all the data on your hard drive. You might want to resize your /dev/sda5 partition to use the 263.28GB unallocated space. To achieve this you could use the PartedMagic LiveCD ( http://www.partedmagic.com). Note that resizing and moving your system partition is most likely to destroy your bootloader so you might want to use supergrubdisk2 (should be included in PartedMagic, but you're safer when having it on a separate CD) after resizing to start your system and reinstall the bootloader with the following commands:\nsudo update-grub\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda1\nIf that doesn't work, boot again with supergrubdisk and install grub to /dev/sda instead of /dev/sda1.\n", "Q: fresh install, won't boot, only in safemode it's a win7 dual boot.\nit just gives me the orange background when booting and nothing else.\nin safe mode however it boots normal but very slow/freezes when i try to do anything.\ni don't know how to go about it, when i live run it from usb it works like magic\nand very fast, way faster than windows 7;\ni have now deleted it, but i'am looking forward to making it work.\nany help is appreciated, thanks in advance\nhere are my specs\n    Operating System\n        MS Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit SP1\n    CPU\n        Intel Core i5 750  @ 2.67GHz    44 °C\n        Lynnfield 45nm Technology\n    RAM\n        4.00 GB Dual-Channel DDR3 @ 660MHz (9-9-9-24)\n    Motherboard\n        Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd.

You could try something like this (non-free) software to make surface tests.\nThere is a fair amount of redundancy in ext4 so I wouldn't worry too much about the data yet. But restore your backups somewhere else just in case.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 isn't working with one of my crontab commands... any ideas? In my crontab file (sudo crontab -e) I have the following commands:\n*/1 * * * * wget -q -O /dev/null http://help.mysite.com/inc/mail/hesk_pop3.php\n0 7 * * * bash -c \"/home/backup/backupscript.sh\"\n\nThe first line executes and works correctly, but the second line isn't working for some reason. However, If I run the script through terminal (./backupscript.sh) it runs correctly.\nThe backupscript.sh file is owned by root:root and has 755 permissions.\nWithin that file is the following bit of code:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n/usr/bin/mysqldump -u root -wordpresspassword wordpressusername | /bin/gzip > /home/backup/mysql/wordpress_`date +%m-%d-%Y_%T`.sql.gz\n/usr/bin/mysqldump -u root -heskpassword heskusername | /bin/gzip > /home/backup/mysql/hesk_`date +%m-%d-%Y_%T`.sql.gz\n/bin/tar cvzf /home/backup/wordpress/wordpress_`date +%m-%d-%Y_%T`.tar.gz /var/www/wordpress/\n/bin/tar cvzf /home/backup/hesk/hesk_`date +%m-%d-%Y_%T`.tar.gz /var/www/hesk/\n/usr/bin/s3cmd sync -r -P /home/backup/ s3://backups.mysite/\nfind /home/backup/ -mtime +7 -type f -exec rm {} \\;\n\nThe script basically backups our MySQL databases and compresses them, backs up our apache sites and compresses them, copies those files to Amazon S3, and then performs a cleanup on the server.\nWhat am I missing here? I've tried a number of things like switching from bash to shell but nothing I've done has worked yet.\n\nA: General tips for debugging crontab:\n\n*\n\n*catch the output. \n\n*\n\n*Either redirect it to a file, e.g. { command1; command2; } &>/tmp/joboutput\n\n*or ensure that the crond send output as email to your mailbox by setting MAILTO=user@example.com in your crontab.\n\n\n*The shell environment of process invoked by crontab differ from the environment started the same process in a terminal. \nEnsure that all necessary environment variables either specified inside the crontab. \n\n*% has a special meaning in the crontab (read carefully man 5 crontab :-)\n\nThe entire command portion of the line, up to a newline or % character, will be executed by /bin/sh or by the shell specified in the SHELL variable of the crontab file. Percent-signs (%) in the command, unless  escaped  with  backslash (),  will be changed into newline characters, and all data after the first % will be sent to the command as standard input. There is no way to split a single command line onto multiple lines, like the shell's trailing \"\\\".\n  \n\n\nA: one workaround is to use shell script to do this:\nfor (( ; ;))\ndo\n   sleep 86400\n   wget -q -O http://help.mysite.com/inc/mail/hesk_pop3.php\n   /bin/sh /home/backup/backupscript.sh\ndone\n\nIn above script, I have used sleep 86400 (it's equivalent of one day in seconds). You can configure your interval accordingly.\nIf you want to run on some server/desktop by logging using ssh, then start/run this script as background process.\n", "Q: Cannot find \"has_antenna_diversity_support\" I have a HP Pavilion dm1 and I cannot get the wireless to work.\nI have found may tutorials on how to fix this, but they require changing HAS_ANTENNA_DIVERSITY_SUPPORT to HAS_ANTENNA_DIVERSITY_SUPPORT=y.\nI cannot find HAS_ANTENNA_DIVERSITY_SUPPORT in the list that is generated when I enter vi os/linux/config.mk.\nI followed this tutorial making changes to version number as what was in the package was not the same version. It was 3.5.0.3 instead of 2.4.0.4.\nI am running the latest version of Ubuntu.\n\nA: I believe the version is 2.5.0.3; that's the latest version at Realtek's site.\n#Support Antenna Diversity\nHAS_ANTENNA_DIVERSITY_SUPPORT=n\n\nThis is located at lines 114-115 of os/linux/config.mk.\n", "Q: Fans running very fast on MacBook Pro 8.1 I installed Ubuntu 12.04 on Macbook Pro 8.1 and one of the first things I noticed was that the fans were starting to spin very fast every few minutes for 10-30 sec and then going back to normal. That was happening even without any processor load, when completely idle. The fans were usually spinning at >4000 RPM and made much noise. The computer was not getting hotter than usual. When running OSX Lion there was no noise at all, fans almost all the time at 2000 RPM. \nI spent some time on it and found out that Precise uses a deamon to control the temperature, called macfanctld. You can use /etc/macfanctld.conf to set the configuration.\nI found out that the high fan speed is not due to the fact that the temperature is getting hot, but because there are two sensors which indicate wrong numbers (you can check that using 'sensors' command ): \nTW0P:        +129.0°C  \nTCTD:        +256.0°C  \nTCFC:          +0.0°C  \nTMBS:          +0.0°C  \n\nor setting the macfanctld log level to 2:\nSpeed: 4992, *AVG: 56.9C,  TC0P: 50.2C,  TG0P: 51.5C, Sensors: TB0T:34 TB1T:34 TB2T:33 TC0C:58 TC0D:56 TC0E:59 TC0F:60 TC0P:50 TC1C:58 TC2C:58 TC3C:58 TC4C:57 TCFC:0 TCGC:57 TCSA:53 TCTD:256 TG0D:52 TG0P:52 THSP:42 TM0S:64 TMBS:0 TP0P:54 TPCD:60 TW0P:129 Th1H:51 Th2H:48 Tm0P:40 Ts0P:32 Ts0S:43 \n\nMoreover, TCTD was randomly jumping from temperatures of 0 to 256, so this may be the reason for unjustified random fan speeds.\nmacfanctld is taking an average of the sensors including the values above, so the actual AVG temp used to control the fans is wrong, usually biased up, hence high RPM and noise.\nThe workaround solution is to use an option in the macfanctld.conf which allows to ignore the malfunctioning sensors:\nexclude: 13 16 21 24\n\nAfter reboot the reported temperatures are usually normal and the fans are working at reasonable speeds. I tested the response of the fans to heavy processor load by asking MATLAB to invert 10000x10000 matrix and the AVG temperature jumped to 63deg, and the fan to max 6200 RPM and then got it back to normal temperature. So I think it is safe so far.\nThere is a expired bug about the failing sensor readings:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/955538\nwhich may be good to open again.\nMy question would be: does anyone know what the failing sensors do and if there is any danger in excluding them? Maybe some better solution to this problem?\n\nA: Installing applesmc-dkms might be helpful. \nI had full fan speed problem just after installing macfanctld in MacMini 6.2. Then I installed applesmc-dkm, and did sudo sensors-detect. \nThe next time I restarted and the fan was normal, also the command sensors is showing the fan speed too. \n\nA: Install this stuff instead of macfanctld. Macfan has error while reading sensor.\nhttps://github.com/dgraziotin/Fan-Control-Daemon.git\n\nA: I installed macfanctld on my Air and had the exact same problem.

I run Precise with Unity3D on my primary laptop, and have grown very fond of the Window Spread feature in Compiz, which I have set to be activated with a top-left Hot Corner.  I have recently acquired an HP Mini 210 and have installed Precise on it as well, but due to its low specs I have decided to use MATE as my primary DE (Unity is very sluggish, and I prefer MATE over LXDE or XFCE).  Is there a way I can get Window Spread functionality in MATE without using Compiz? \n\nA: MATE uses it's own version of the Gnome 2 Metacity window manager, If I remember correctly back then it didn't do much that's why users preferred to use Compiz in Gnome 2. So, what I suggest you to use is the gala window manager, which has a \"similar\" feature and it's lightweight. It's developed by the elementary Team you can install it using their PPA:\n  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:elementary-os/daily\n  sudo apt-get update\n  sudo apt-get install gala\n  gala --repĺace\n\nWhile it's still in active development it's really usable.\nAnother thing you can try is to use muffin the window manager in Cinnamon which also has a similar feature, all you have to do is Install Cinnamon and execute muffin --replace.\n\nA: Lubuntu and xfce users have been using a combination of Skippy-XD (expose like functionality) and brightside (hot spots) and compton as a WM. Instructions for their use should be easily applicable to MATE. \nCheck out http://lubuntublog.blogspot.com.es/p/expos.html and http://lubuntublog.blogspot.com.es/p/compton.html.

Unfortunately due to the seriousness of the issue I had to reboot the server, after which usage seems to match correctly.\n\nA: From a similar question on ServerFault (and particularly one response there), one possible explanation for the disparity is that there are processes hanging on to files they've accessed on /tmp that have since been deleted.\n# lsof | grep deleted\n\nwill list such files along with the processes still attached to them.\n", "Q: How to scroll like a normal windows when I am using screen When I use screen, how can I scroll the content of my shell as if i open a normal terminal?\nWhen I do that now, I can only scroll 1 screen of content? \n\nA: If you are talking about tty's, you can use Shift + PageUp and Shift + PageDown buttons.\n", "Q: Freeing disk space on Ubuntu to use in Windows I have 250Gb drive on a laptop, which has Windows 7 on a 122Gb ntfs partition (which has a \"boot\" flag on it) and Ubuntu 12.04.1 on a 110Gb extended partition, of which the root ext4 partition is 108Gb and the swap is 1.74Gb. You can see everything in the screenshot below. \n         My question is:\n\n\n*\n\n*I want to diminish the size of the linux root partition and then use that space to increase the windows partition. How do I do that?\n\n*Also, is it possible to increase the size of the swap partition and not do any damage? If so, how?\nI'm using GParted, and i'd say i'm pretty confident with it.\nScreenshot of my partitions\n\nA: For 1), this will be tough as you will need to shrink the root FS, then the root partition, move the root partition to create a gap between the Windows partition and the extended one, then extend the Windows partition. All this is best done using a LiveCD like http://www.sysresccd.org/Download\nFor 2), if you have free unpartitioned HDD space then you will need to: deactivate the swap, extent the swap partition, re-format it (mkswap), re-activate the swap. You need to update the /etc/fstab file to use the right UUID of your new swap.\n\nA: SOLVED! Thanks all! I did everything, and finally got to the point where there was unallocated space in between the windows and ubuntu partitions, but then GParted (in Puppy Linux) would extend the windows partition to include the unallocated space for some reason, so I ended up doing that in windows, and it worked great. Also managed to increase swap size as well. \n", "Q: Screenshot of the Gnome Shell Activities screen Is there a way to take a screenshot of the gnome shell activities screen i.e the screen that pops up on pressing the Win key or Alt+F1? The PrintScr button works normally but doesn't seem to work when I'm on the activities screen. Is this normal behavior? If yes, are there workarounds?\n\nA: If other things are failing, use the import command --\nimport -window root screenshot.jpg\nIt will pick up things that often aren't found by using gnome-screenshot or shutter, etc.\n\nA: Open up the gnome-screenshot (Alt+F2 and type gnome-screenshot --interactive) tool and enable \"Grab the whole desktop\" and then enable \"Grab after a delay of 5 seconds\"\nThen simply click \"Take Screenshot\" and bring up your Activities screen by pressing Win/Super key and in 5 seconds it will take a Screenshot.\nHope that helps! :)\n\nA: There are really many ways of taking screenshots!

The NAT adapter I've noticed sometimes fails for people, while bridged mode is always a reliable fallback. Virtualbox has a section on what the different modes and options for them here:\nhttp://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html\nBe careful, the bridged mode send packets through your host system, but bypasses your networking stack.\n", "Q: Can I use publish an application using SDL, even commercially? I wrote a game in Windows a while back, and I'd like to port it to finish it under Ubuntu, especially as I could publish it via the software centre.

Personally, I've honestly tried and I simply can't get my head around all these licenses.\nCan anyone here tell me whether I can use it commercially or do I need to cut out all the SDL framework? \nAny help is hugely appreciated.\nThank you.\n\nA: Yes, you can use SDL in a commercial project. The LGPL allows you to link SDL to proprietary code. (See this, this article, and that version of the license itself.) What it means is if you change SDL you have to also release those changes under the LGPL.\nIt is, of course, important that you read and understand the license itself before creating any derivative work of a work licensed with it, including before creating a program (proprietary or otherwise) that links to SDL.\nFurthermore, please note that this answer is provided for general informational purposes only.\nThis post is not legal advice.\n", "Q: Unable to boot into Windows after installing Ubuntu I installed Ubuntu 12.04 as a dual boot with Windows 7 (64bit).

You can download the alternate install cd from here:\nhttp://releases.ubuntu.com/\nThe installer will be text based and should run fine on a computer with those resources. Since you have such little ram, I would also recommend using a flavor such as lubuntu or xubuntu instead of ubuntu itself.

I'm interested in contributing translations to Ubuntu. How do I create a translations team so I can contribute?\n\nA: Translating Ubuntu is a rewarding effort to provide users with the operating system in their language, but at the same time it carries a great deal of responsibility.\nWe want to make sure users get the most of their native language support, and while lowering the barrier for contributions, we also need to make sure that translators are aware about this responsibility, best practices for translations and of the existence of other projects' translation efforts.\nYou should start a new team only if there is no translation team appointed for your language. Otherwise you should contact the current team and start working with them. You can identify the team appointed for translating Ubuntu into your language by looking it up on the list of teams in the Ubuntu Translators group.\n\n\n*\n\n*If the team is no longer active, please let us know by filing a support request and the Ubuntu Translations Coordinators can transfer you the responsibilities of running the team.\n\n\nBefore you apply\nHere's the checklist to create a new Ubuntu translations team:\n\n\n*\n\n*Check for an existing team. Make sure there isn't already an existing Ubuntu translations team for your language. If this is the case, you can skip all subsequent steps and ask to join the team instead.\n\n*Natural language. Make sure the language is spoken by real people. There isn't, and there won't be locale support for languages that are spoken by no one at home - so dead languages like Latin or fictional ones like Klingon won't have any support in Ubuntu, sorry.\n\n*Locale, keyboard and fonts. Make sure the language has a defined code, keyboard and fonts. You can skip this step if your language fulfills all requirements.\n\n*Launchpad team. Create a new Launchpad team for your language. The team's name must accord to the following rules:\n\n\n*\n\n*ubuntu-l10n-$ISO-639-language-code - Where $ISO-639-language-code is a two-letter or a three-letter (if the two-letter one is not available) ISO 639 code. You can search for the code for your language here. If you don't find your code there, you may want to look at the more comprehensive ISO 639-3 list \n\n\n*Moderated subscription. Make the subscription policy of the new team Moderated or Restricted. Only this way you can ensure the quality of translations and make sure that upstream translations are not modified for no good reason.\n\n*Team information. Add some brief information on the team's page. This should include:\n\n\n*\n\n*A welcome note with the purpose of the team\n\n*A note on how to join the team\n\n*Links to the team's existing communication channels (e.g. mailing list, forums, IRC channel, wiki, etc) \n\n\n*Team communication. The team should have a communication channel to coordinate the translation activities. This can be any of: a mailing list, IRC, forums, etc. This can be arranged after the team has been accepted, but it is a requirement.\n\n*Guidelines. The team should have a set of translation guidelines. This can be arranged after the team has been accepted, but it is a requirement.\n\n*Upstream collaboration. The team should be aware of any upstream translation efforts (e.g. GNOME, KDE, Mozilla, OpenOffice.org, Debian, etc.), and coordinate with them if possible. You'll find more information about the different upstreams here.\n\n*Coordinator. The team should have a coordinator, who should subscribe to the ubuntu-translators mailing list and forward any relevant announcements or information to the team. It is recommended that all team coordinators read the best practices for the role. \nApplying\n\n\n*\n\n*Application. Once all points have been checked, simply file a support request briefly explaining how you addressed all of the points above, and the Ubuntu Translations Coordinators will add the team to the Ubuntu Translators group. If the information is not clear, they might ask you some questions. That might delay the approval of your team, so please try to be clear on each of the points. \n\n\nAfter the team has been accepted\n\n\n*\n\n*Announcement. Send an e-mail announcing that the team has been created to the ubuntu-translators mailing list.\n\n*Ubuntu l10n mailing list. If you wish to do so, you can request the creation of an official Ubuntu mailing list for your translation team by sending an e-mail to rt(at)ubuntu(dot)com. The name of the list should match the name of the team in Launchpad (ubuntu-l10n-).\n\n*Guidelines. Remember to add the translation guidelines to your team.\n\n*Request language addition. If your language is a new one, you should do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Submit the new locale to the glibc maintainers\n\n*Request the addition of the language in Launchpad\n\n*File a bug to request the creation of an Ubuntu language pack. \nIt is also recommended to read the Ubuntu Translations Knowledge Base to start getting familiar with how translations work in Ubuntu. \n", "Q: How to remove the graphical user interface? Okay my question is that, I want to run a heavy application, on a Virtual Machine (VirtualBox) with just 2 GB RAM (Windows 7 32Bit Host has 4 GB, 3.5 GB effective). Initially I thought of installing Ubuntu Server 12.04.1, which doesn't come with a GUI, so I thought it would be efficient in performance, but I have only Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop.\nMy question is, is it possible to remove the GUI parts in Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop (Not Server), keeping only the core OS, after installation in a virtual machine? \nOr, is there anyway to improve the performance of the OS?\nIf you need more information, I am ready to provide.\nI don't want the GUI or anything, even a small terminal window is fine for me, I can access files through FTP.\n\nA: It is not needed to remove the GUI (unity, lightdm, compiz, etc.) from the system.\nYou can leave it and just make your default boot as a text mode and if once you need a GUI you can restore it easily.\nopen /etc/default/grub as root in your favourite text editor, for example sudo vi /etc/default/grub And change the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nTo GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"text\" and update Grub.sudo update-grub\nYour system will then always boot to text mode.\nIf you once want to use GUI you can easly start lightdm, the GUI:\nsudo service lightdm start\n\nHere are some hints that you may use to increase performance of your system.\n\nA: None of these answers answers the user's question.\n\n\n*\n\n*Advising how to disable the GUI is not removing it.\n\n*Advising how to use a different GUI is not removing it.\n\n*Advising to use a different Linux distro is not removing it.\n\n\nThe commands to remove the GUI are:\nsudo apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nThis will remove the Ubuntu Desktop meta-package and all associated packages.\nIf you're going to answer the question, answer the question.\n\nA: Alternatively you can install openbox, one of the most lightweight window managers available:\nsudo apt-get install openbox openbox-themes obconf obmenu\n\nThis automatically adds an openbox session to the login menu.

A GUI with an incredibly low RAM footprint, just like you want it.\n", "Q: System starts without sound in Lubuntu When I log in the sound is muted. Why is that?\n\nThis image is from the Xfce mixer, while the lxde volume does not show that the sound is off. \nSo, I can see the sound muted only in Xfce Mixer. But I can also start the sound in another application, Pulse Audio Volume Control, if I change a setting in Output Devices from Analog Mono Output to LFE on Mono Separate Devices:\n \n\nThe Analog Mono Output option here sets in fact the Xfce Mixer in the mute position from the first image.\nCould this be related to managing sessions (and therefore to these question)?\nThis happens in LXDE session as well as in Lubuntu session. Starting sound and logging out and in between any of these two sessions would mute the volume as shown. Starting the volume in one of these and logging out and then logging in into the Gnome session, the sound would be off; but then, after starting sound, logging out of Gnome and then logging in into any session, the sound would not be muted. But after restart it would be so no matter the session.\n\nA: This must not have to do with pulse audio, rather, with ALSA (the linux sound driver). \nTry configuring the ALSA driver with this command: amixer sset Master unmute or if that don't work, fire up a terminal and type alsamixer which uses an ncurses gui to configure.\nAfter you have done any configurations, type in the terminal alsactl store and be sure to add the ALSA daemon in your init configuration files.\nIf you would need more information, you could find it here. It's very accurate, but be careful with the part about the init config files because Arch uses different config files to my knowledge than Debian.\n\nA: As seen in the first image in the question, the Xfce Mixer has a setting concerning the sound card. Changing that as below solved the problem. \n\nI had installed the Xfce mixer for its advanced options, but these are not available for the option showed here: the microphone settings are not available in this way, which might be a problem.

Do not waste your time in xml files. Alacarte is the best graphical menu editor for all gtk based menu systems.\nsudo apt-get install alacarte\n\n\nNote/update: alacarte (Main Menu editor) does not work in 12.04 or 12.10 Lubuntu\n\nA: *\n\n*LXMenuEditor (Main Menu Editor)\nExecute the LXMenuEditor.jar file (Java needed), and then use the program to add the same file to the main menu...

See this and this answer. But, just like LXMenuEditor (and unlike Alacarte), it cannot create/edit main categories.\n\n\n*Considering Alacarte in Lubuntu: it deserves a try as far as it can edit/create main categories, but it's actions are indeed only randomly possible in 12.10 , and, as far as I can tell,  it doesn't work at all in 12.04. It has to be regarded at this point (version 0.13.2-2ubuntu4) as unsuitable for LXDE/Lubuntu (as it is made for Gnome). Please comment here if this is not the case or if it changes in a new version.  For a reason on why it does not work, see this answer.\n\nA: The default menu entries are located in the /usr/share/applications/ directory.\nFor example, the Chrome browser can be edited at /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop\nIf an entry is also defined in the local .local/share/applications/ directory then it overrides the default one.\n\nA: In 16.04 go to -/.local/share/applications and delete the offending item.\nThen openbox --restart\n\nA: Command line simplification of saimischief's answer:\npcmanfm menu://applications && lxpanelctl restart\n\nThis will start up pcmanfm in the correct directory, and one can rename, copy, move, or delete menu items as needed.  After pcmanfm is closed, lxpanelctl restart will update the menu.\n\nIt's even possible to edit the .desktop configuration files that the menu items link to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on an item, for example menu://applications/Internet/ pick Firefox Web Browser.\n\n*A little menu pops up, pick Properties, which starts a little GUI, and allows the user to change several things, like the title, the command line options etc..\n\n\nA text editor can be used for more fine-grained control of .desktop configuration files:\n\n\n*\n\n*Right click on an item, for example menu://applications/Internet/ pick Firefox Web Browser.\n\n*A little menu pops up, pick Open With, and then select your preferred text editor from the list of programs.\n\n", "Q: Installing 12.04 through Update Manager on a XP/ubuntu dual-boot I currently have a dual-boot system running XP Pro SP3 with Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

Is there anyway to see whether Ubuntu uses write through or write back policy?\nI know that write back is much better, but when I write a program in C to test the cache, it appears that Ubuntu uses write through.\nUPDATE: I mean it's CPU Cache not the filesystem cache. What Im concerned about is the policy of writing to cache L1,L2,L3 and the RAM. Thank you!.\n\nA: In a write-back cache, when changes are made to cached data, they are not simultaneously made to the original data as well. Instead, the changed data is marked, and the original data is updated when the chached data is deallocated.\nIn a write-through cache, by contrast changes made to cached data are simultaneously made in the original copy. A write-back cache can perform more quickly than a write-through cache. But in some contexts, differences between cached and original data could lead to problems, and write-through caches must be used\nsource\nNow, Its doesn't matter what OS are you working on the really thing that affects is the file system you are using.\nUbuntu by default use ext4 as it filesystem and to know ext4 uses the both modes write-back and write-through.\nTo enable write back mode\nRun:\n tune2fs -o journal_data_writeback /dev/sd*\n\nEdit fstab\nvi -w /mnt/sdXY/etc/fstab\n\nFind the line that references sd* It will look something like:\n# /dev/sda2\nUUID=be2f0ac2-4683-4550-bcd1-704a1a840b3e / ext4 relatime,errors=remount-ro 0 1\n\n\nThe first entry is the UUID .\nThe second entry is the path.\nThird is the fstype . \nFourth are the options. \nFifth is for dump\nSixth is pass.\n\nChange the options(4th) to:\nnoatime,data=writeback,barrier=0,nobh,errors=remount-ro\n\nReboot your system to complete changes.\nsource\nAlso check this for more information.\n\nA: You can also consult the current \"data=\" mode by looking at /proc/mounts. Here is an example from my laptop:\n$ grep ext /proc/mounts \n/dev/mapper/crypt-root / ext4 rw,noatime,errors=remount-ro,user_xattr,barrier=1,data=ordered 0 0\n/dev/mapper/vg0-boot /boot ext4 rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,noatime,user_xattr,barrier=1,data=ordered 0 0\n/dev/mapper/crypt-homes /home ext4 rw,nosuid,noatime,user_xattr,acl,commit=60,barrier=1,data=ordered 0 0\n\nAlso, note that \"nobh\" is a deprecated mount option.\n\nA: You could also see if using the O_SYNC | O_DIRECT flags in open() is what you want.  The manual states:\n\"The  O_DIRECT  flag  on its own makes an effort to transfer data synchronously, but does not give the guarantees  of  the  O_SYNC flag that data and necessary metadata are transferred.  To guarantee synchronous I/O,  O_SYNC  must  be  used  in  addition  to O_DIRECT.\"\nSee man 2 open open for more details.\n", "Q: To write a batch processing script which runs on bash How to convert your java program so that it runs as a batch program i.e it can be run like a command in the ubuntu or any linux machine. What is the procedure and what are the steps to follow?\nSpecifically java program. C program is also fine.\nI want to know if any libraries to be added to the java/c program and also where to place the program and how to write a man page. \n\nA: You can not \"convert\" a program written on C or Java in order to run as a bash script. Bash uses different syntax, so most likely you will have to rewrite the logic on a bash script.\nNow if you are only asking about how to execute a program written on Java/C via the command line, then the answer is pretty simple.\nFor C:\nEditor Choice\nNow in order to write a C program in linux, all you need to do is to fire up an editor (gedit is a very good gui editor, nano is good for beginners with the command line, vim/emacs for experienced programmers), like this: gedit myprogram.c or vim myprogram.c and start coding. Below is an example of an text editor editing source a Hello World program in C on my computer in the Ubuntu terminal.\n\nNOTE:You can also use a piece of software called an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to do C programming. Popular IDEs include code::blocks, Eclipse with a plugin called CDT (C/C++ Development tools) and my all time favorite for newbies and starters Geany (although one could argue that Geany is more of an editor, than an IDE, but whatever).\nC Standard Library\nThe standard C Library (glibc) is pretty much in every Linux or Unix system there is and is POSIX compliant. You can find most of in /usr/include. A fine trick to find where headers (libraries) you are interested in exist in your system is firing up a terminal and typing whereis followed by the header filename like this: whereis stdio.h\nCompilation\nSupposing you have created a file called myprogram.c that has c source code in it, then you compile it first via a compiler (GCC belonging to the GNU toolchain is contained in nearly every linux system. I am not a 100% sure about this, but I believe that POSIX instructs that there are such tools in the basic OS) like this: gcc myprogram.c and then you execute the executable (in this case a.out, since we did not define an executable output name to the compiler) like this: ./a.out\nFor Java:\nJava Development Kit\nTo begin with java development you must make sure there is at least one version of the Java Development Kit (JDK). To make sure you have jdk installed, open up your Ubuntu Software Center, and Type in the Search box Java Development Kit.\n\nIf you see at least one package with \"Java Development Kit\" or JDK in its name marked with a tick, then this means that you have JDK installed. \nWARNING: You need to have a JDK version that supports the version of Java you want to program in and above, otherwise you won't be able to work properly. For instance a JDK that supports Java v6 can compile java source code with features up until Java 6 BUT NOT java 7. A jdk that supports Java version 7 can compile source code that has features up until version 7 (including 6).\nSECOND WARNING: You MUST make sure that you have at least one version of a JDK installed. If you see a package named JRE you this doesn't apply to your needs. JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment and you need it to run Java applications. In order to program them, you need a Java Development Kit. A Java Development Kit also includes many of the tools found in Java Runtime Environments.\nEditor (IDE)\nYou may be able to follow the C like code writing technique for java (firing up any text editor and start typing), but for java, such techniques are impractical for serious development. This is why many Java developers use tools named IDE s which stand for Integrated Development Environment that make your life easier when you write source code by attempting to support all the features you might want to have (including, but not limited to, code completion, a debugger, a profiler, compiler integration, etc) under one piece of software. In Ubuntu software centre you can find 3 very good IDEs that you can choose from. The first one is Netbeans which is very friendly to beginners (well, it is at least friendlier than the other too) while being fairly powerful. If you feel like you want more, or are more advanced Java developer you can choose between Eclipse (very popular among Java Developers worldwide on any platform) and IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition by JetBrains which is one nice and powerful Java IDE.\nBelow is a screenshot of Eclipse, a fairly popular Java IDE.\n\nCompilation\nNow, to compile your java software files (assuming myprogram.java source code file) with the java compiler like this: javac myprogram.java and then you find the compiler output (should be a .class file, in this case myprogram.class) and call the java virtual machine to process it like this: java myprogram.class\n\nA: C is native in Linux, so you don't need extra libraries. You just compile (using gcc for example), and run your newly created file. See: http://www.codecoffee.com/tipsforlinux/articles/18.html\nFor java, you need to use java -jar youJavaJar.jar to execute it. I don't think it's possible to compile for native Linux.\nFor your man page, have a look at this: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-creating-a-manpage/\n", "Q: Apache2 post installation I use the following command to install Apache server:\nsudo apt-get install apache2\n\nThe installation process seems to have completed without any problems.

Then I realized the ubuntu os is installed in a space of 17GB which I don't know how it came about. My question is how to resize the the 17GB so that I can have the ubuntu os in the 250GB. \nI am new in ubuntu and need help desperately cos I don't wanna loose my work there.... \n\nA: I would suggest downloading Gparted  and creating a boot disk.  This will give you a simple method of creating, deleting and resizing disk partitions.  The following links may help:\nGnome Partition Editor\nGParted partitioning software – Full tutorial\nManual partitioning\nIn addition, since you are concerned about maintaining the integrity of your system/data, if you don't already make regular backups, I would suggest that you do so prior to changing the disk structure.\n\nA: From the size it sounds like you did a Wubi install inside the Windows partition, not a a full install in another partition.  Have a look at this question which asks how to resize a Wubi install. : increase-size-of-root-partition-after-installing-ubuntu-in-windows\nIt might be better to install properly on that spare partition rather than continue to use Wubi when you don't need to.  You'll need to boot off the Live CD or USB to install Ubuntu but before you do boot the Ubuntu that you have installed and check which disk the root file system is on.  As per the question linked above, open a terminal window after Ubuntu boots and type the following:\ndf -h\n\nand paste the results here so we can see.\nFrom the result of you 'df -h' you can see that Ubuntu is running off an 18GB Virtual disk that is in the Windows partition.  In other words, you did a Wubi install, you did not set up a dual boot system with Ubuntu in its own partition.\nI suggest you boot off the LiveCD or LiveUSB and do a full install of Ubuntu alongside Windows.\nI highly recommend that you back up all your important data before you do this.  While it's unlikely anything bad will happen if you are very careful, it's good piece of mind to know that your data is safe if something bad does happen.

If I open a PDF document by evince and try to print a page, the following message appears on the terminal: `\n**WARNING: gnome-keyring:: couldn't connect to: /tmp/keyring-9mrPtj/pkcs11: No such file or directory**.\n\nAnother change I notice is that earlier it was normal to see two printers in the options for printers after installation was completed and installation details suggested which one is to be made the default printer for my purpose. These are available now also but the default printer option had automatically changed (to the best of my knowledge). \nPlease suggest some way to make the printer work. I understand the previous driver downloaded from Radu Kotescu's site was specifically for 10.04 and now I am running 12.04. So the situation a bit complicated. (Please also note that apparmor is in enforced mode, relevant profile being /usr/sbin/cupsd, but this was same in 10.04 version) What should I do now? \n\nA: You might find some help here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters/CanonPrinters.\n", "Q: What utility is like Ten Clips, providing an enumerated clipboard? A very useful (Windows) utility I use is TenClips - http://www.paludour.net/TenClips.html\nIt allows you to create enumerated clipboards/emacs-like buffers easily using ctrl + f1, ctrl + f2, ctrl + f3, etc., copy to the clipboard in the first buffer, switch to the second buffer, copy without loosing our first buffer, switch back to the first buffer and paste, switch to the second buffer and paste and so forth.\nDoes something like this exist for Ubuntu? The closest post I could find was Looking for an application that saves clipboard history which recommended Parcellite (http://parcellite.sourceforge.net/?page_id=2) - which keeps the history - but this is not quite what I'm after. If not I might make this a pet project :D\n\nA: Try Clipit, it's installable in the software center.  Clipit was forked from the Parcellite clipboard manager and has more features and bugfixes but you might like Parcellite over Clipit.\nThe really big advantage of a clipboard manager under Linux is that it will maintain the clipboard even after you close the application you did the cut from.  Losing the clipboard when you close an application is one of those little bugbears in Linux that you either learn to live with, or get around by using one of these clipboard managers. \nTo re-use the clipboard history with enumeration open the preferences and turn \"Automatically paste selected item\" and \"Show indexes in History\" on.  You would then use the hotkeys for history, and then press the number of the item you want to paste.  The hotkey for history is programmable, however you might want to leave it as it is for the moment: ctrlalth\nWhile this does not let you store items under a specific number, you do get a visible list of the items which is sortable if you want.  The programmable actions would seem to be another way of doing things, however there's not much documentation on this feature at the moment.  I believe the history hotkey and automatic paste feature should give you most of the functionality you need.  Chris\n", "Q: How to install updates via command line? When I log into my web server via SSH I see the information:\n88 packages can be updated.\n80 updates are security updates\n\nI tried apt-get update then apt-get upgrade but each time I log in I still see the message about updates. How do I install them?\n\nA: This is normal behavior.\nThe message you see on login has been appended to the server status 'Message-Of-The-Day', which is only updated each calendar day (or on server boot / startup).  Have a look at the contents, using\ncat /etc/motd\n\nStill seeing the same updates available, after running\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nis to be expected.

I intend to use XP as my host system, but I wanted to find out if it is possible to run Quantal Quetzal as my guest OS in VMWare Workstation.\n\nA: It depends on what you want to accomplish. It's pretty easy to install Ubuntu 12.10 in a new machine, but not everything works completely.\nAs of this writing (October 20), there were known issues when trying to compile VMware Tools (which provide better integration with the host for sound, video, shared folders, and other benefits). This is a problem due to the Linux Kernel 3.5, which ships with Ubuntu.\nThere may be a patch floating around the Internet which can be used to get tools up and running (I've had trouble finding it, but have read several forum posts which refer to it), but you have to manually patch the sources. This isn't difficult, but can be somewhat involved and is a pain.\nPlease note that all of my comments apply to Workstation 8.0. The problem may have been fixed in the most recent version of Workstation (9.0). But as I just purchased 8.0 six months ago (and it is supposed to provide the most recent version of VMware Tools), I refuse to shell out again for a new upgrade.\nEdit: Since writing the original response, I've since gone back and tried a few other options for getting the VMware tools up and running. Ubuntu provides a package called open-vm-tools which have a patched copy of the VMware tools available. Using this package, I was able to get almost everyhing running correctly, with one exception: the shared folders have to be mounted manually. \n\nA: Sure - lots of developers have been testing Quantal in a virtualized environment. I can't speak to XP Professional hosts in particular, but Quantal is fine inside VMware Workstation.\nInstalling VMware Tools is different. It only takes about 15 minutes to install the OS once you download it. So just give it a try.\n", "Q: How do I add the messaging menu to the xfce-panel?

With 512MB ram I'd recommend you trying if it would work out with 256MB to VM.\n\nA: Does it still do this with < Hard Drive Virtual Disk Controller: IDE >? Try to disable \"Host I/O cache\" and make a hard drive under IDE and see if it does it. Edit: Forgot to mention, Recommend disabling all Hardware Virtualization options just for troubleshooting. Under system [Processor -> PAE/NX] [System -> Acceleration -> V-x] and of course 3D video.\n", "Q: Error linking standard header file in gcc I've a simple code - this works on other platforms but does not work in ubuntu.\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\nint main()\n{\nint x=99;\nchar str[100];\nitoa(99, str, 10);\nreturn 0;\n}\n\nTrying to compile in using terminal in gcc with :\ngcc test.c\n\nBut I get the error:\n/tmp/ccJN77g6.o: In function `main':\ntest.c:(.text+0x35): undefined reference to `itoa'\ncollect2: ld returned 1 exit status\n\nWhy so? prototype for itoa is included in stdlib.h\n\nA: itoa doesn't seem to be ANSI C++ and thus is very likely to be not supported by gcc.\nAccording to this source, a the following workaround is suggested:\n\nThis function is not defined in ANSI-C and is not part of C++, but is supported by some compilers.\n\nA standard-compliant alternative for some cases may be sprintf:\n\n    sprintf(str,\"%d\",value) converts to decimal base.\n    sprintf(str,\"%x\",value) converts to hexadecimal base.\n    sprintf(str,\"%o\",value) converts to octal base.\n\nA sprintf reference can be found here.\n\nA: itoa function is not portable, non standard and most Linux compilers doesn't support it.  \nInstead you should use snprintf() function\nCheck the snprintf reference here\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\nint main()\n{\nint x=99;\nchar str[100];\n// itoa(99, str, 10);\nsnprintf(str,10,\"%d\", x);\nreturn 0;\n}\n\n\nA: I used the code you entered and I get the same error. It would appear that itoa() isn't ANSI C standard and doesn't work with GCC on Linux (at least the version I'm using).

I have recently become interested in Eidete Screencaster, and I am trying to compile it from source on Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS.\nAfter running bzr branch lp:eidete, I navigated into the ~/eidete directory and found an INSTALL file with the following contents:\nDependencies:\n    gtk+-3.0\n    libwnck-3.0\n    gstreamer-interfaces-0.10\n    gstreamer-0.10\n    gstreamer-pbutils-0.10\n    granite\n    xtst\n    gdk-x11-3.0\n\nInstallation:\n    bzr branch lp:eidete\n    cd eidete\n    mkdir build\n    cd build\n    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr\n    make\n    sudo make install\n\nAfter some investigation, I believe I have correctly satisfied all package dependencies, as I no longer get complaints about that when I run the cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr step. However, when I then try to run make, the build fails with the following output:\nchristopher@XyzPrecise:~/eidete/build$ make\n[  7%] Generating src/eidete.c, src/Widgets/countdown.c, src/Widgets/keyview.c, src/Widgets/selectionarea.c, src/Widgets/end_dialog.c, src/desktop_launcher.c, build/src/Config.c\nerror: Package `granite' not found in specified Vala API directories or GObject-Introspection GIR directories\nCompilation failed: 1 error(s), 0 warning(s)\nmake[2]: *** [src/eidete.c] Error 1\nmake[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/eidete.dir/all] Error 2\nmake: *** [all] Error 2\n\nThe step before that previously complained that I didn't have the necessary version of Vala installed, so I installed it from the Vala PPA and didn't get the warning from cmake anymore after that. All other packages required I installed from the Ubuntu Precise repositories, including libgranite-dev.\nSo, why is make complaining about granite, and how do I correct this so I can build Eidete successfully?\n\nA: The problem is likely that you have an old version of libgranite. To get the latest version, you might have to add the elementary daily PPA as follows:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:elementary-os/daily\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install libgranite-dev\n\nAlternatively, you get can the latest deb's from https://launchpad.net/~elementary-os/+archive/daily/+packages.\nPlease note that in that PPA there are daily builds of Eidete, so compiling from source would be unnecessary.\nAlso, if you'd like it to be easily removable through apt, you can nest the debian/ directory of lp:~elementary-os/eidete/deb-packaging into the root of your Eidete source directory. You can simply copy the files there once they've been branched. Also, note that the packages devscripts and dpkg-dev are needed to create Debian packages.\n", "Q: 12.04 installer won't accept mis-alligned partition So I upgraded Ubuntu from 10.04 to 12.04 and it had issues. Long story short, I backed up everything and want to reinstall.\nThe installer apparently REALLY doesn't like installing on mis-aligned partitions. I get the error\nThe partition /dev/sda5 assigned to / starts on an offset of 3072 bytes... There are two buttons at the bottom \"Go Back\" and  \"Continue\" the problem is that they both do the same thing - namely it kicks me back to the partition table screen.\nHow do I force it to continue?\nnote: Formatting the entire drive is not an option as it has a windows installation on there (sda1, 2 and 3)\n\nA: If you allow the 12.04 installer to create the partitions it will round up the starting and ending sectors so that they will fall on a megabyte boundary--even if the preceding partition doesn't end on a megabyte boundary. In fact, it only allows locations and sizes to be specified as integral number of megabytes.\nI suggest that you use the installer to add the partition(s) you will be using for Ubuntu (by clicking Other rather than choosing to format the entire disk, of course).\nAs an example I manually created a first partition ending at sector 4000 and allowed the Ubuntu installer to create the root partition following it. The following was the result:\n\n   Device Boot      Start       End      Blocks    ID  System\n/dev/sda1           2048        4000       976+    83  Linux\n/dev/sda2           4096    20969471   10482688    83  Linux   \nI was able to get the install going on /dev/sda2.\nI must admit it's not clear to me what panel is displaying the message you are seeing. The partitioning panel has Quit, Back, and Install Now buttons at the bottom.\nIf you don't find this helpful please post more information about how you partitioned the disk and where you are getting the message.\n", "Q: How to install gnome shell extensions offline? I know how to go to the https://extensions.gnome.org/ website and download gnome-shell extensions, but now I need to install some extensions available there on a computer without any internet access at all.

After:\n\n\n*\n\n*copying the folder in the ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/  \n\n*just restart Gnome Shell: Alt+F2 -> R ->  Enter\nand the extension should appear in the gnome-tweaks tool (restart that one as well).\n", "Q: What Partition of HDD should Ubuntu be installed? \n*\n\n*Does installation of Ubuntu from WUBI require another partition for loading? If it loads on C: then is it and OS Environment only? Kindly explain.\n\n*Should it be a Primary Partition only? As I understand that only form Primary partition the OS can be loaded.\n\n\nA: *\n\n*Installing Ubuntu using WUBI (i.e. from within Windows) doesn't require any extra partitions to be created. It simply creates a file on your Windows partition, and adds an entry to the Windows boot loader to boot an OS (Ubuntu) from this image file.\nIt also adds an entry to your \"Add/Remove Programs\" section of Windows so that you can easily remove this Ubuntu image file from your C: (i.e. your Windows partition). The only real downside to this AFAIK is a very slight decrease in speed due to being restrained by the Windows filesystem (NTFS or FAT) speed-wise, but this is only a slight decrease and it's not really noticeable to most users.\n\n\n*See (1), WUBI installs don't need any partitioning.\n\nA: WUBI does not need a partition. It uses a loop device which is a virtual disk therefore it must be installed on a Windows filesystem (C: Drive is OK).\n", "Q: How to find the bitrate of an mp3 file via command line?

I would like to know the default value of a dconf/gsettings key.\nMy question is a followup of the question below:\nWhere can I get a list of SCHEMA / PATH / KEY to use with gsettings?\nWhat I'm trying to do, so create a script that reads all my personal preferences so I can back them up and restore them.  I plan to iterate though all keys, like the script above, see what keys have been changed from their default value, and make a note of these, that can be restored later.\nI see that the dconf-editor display the keys' default value, but I'd very much like to script this.  Also, I don't see how parsing the schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/ can be automated.  Maybe someone can help?\ngsettings get-default|list-defaults would be nice =)\n(Geesh, it was much easier in the old days where you just kept your ~/.somethingrc in subversion ... =\\\n\nBased on the answer given below, I've updated the script to print schema, key, key's data type, default value, and actual value:\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor schema in $(gsettings list-schemas | sort); do\n    for key in $(gsettings list-keys $schema | sort); do\n        type=\"$(gsettings range $schema $key | tr \"\\n\" \" \")\"\n        default=\"$(XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/tmp/ gsettings get $schema $key | tr \"\\n\" \" \")\"\n        value=\"$(gsettings get $schema $key | tr \"\\n\" \" \")\"\n        echo \"$schema :: $key :: $type :: $default :: $value\"\n    done\ndone\n\nThis workaround basically covers what I need.

How to open apps in Ubuntu 12.04 to read documents, play music and video, surf the net and reading emails?\n\nA: As per @devav2:\n\nUse dash. To open dash press 'Super key/Windows key'. For Documents - Libreoffice, Evince. For Music - Rhythmbox . For video- Totem . Surf the net - Chrome/Firefox. For Email- Thunderbird/Evolution . These apps come by default on Ubuntu. Other than this there good apps which can be found on Ubuntu Software Center\n\nLibreoffice is like Microsoft Office and supports most of its formats.\n\nTo listen to music, you can use Rhythmbox. Video can be played with Totem.\n\nTO surf the web, you can use Firefox, or Chromium if you install it in the Ubuntu Software Center.\n\nTo read email on your computer, use Thunderbird or Evince. You can open any of these by clicking the top left button in the launcher(dock-like thing at the left with all the buttons) and typing the name of a program. You can install many more useful things with the Ubuntu Software Center. Many applications there are free, and can be installed as easily as clicking the Install button and giving your password.\n\nA: It depends on your preferences.  You can simply press the super, or Win key (usually between Alt and Ctrl), or press the icon at the top of the Unity Panel (Dash Home) to bring up the Dash. If you know the name, or part of the name, of an app, file, or folder, you can simply start typing until it appears at the top-left of the list of potential targets, then press return or click on the icon.  This is probably the quickest way to run a program whose name you know.\nI have found that sometimes, whatever I do, the left super key will only bring up the list of keyboard shortcuts, which is very annoying; if this happens, press the corresponding right super key instead (this is the only way to dismiss the window).  I think this may be a bug, since it isn't documented to work this way\nIf you don't know the name of the program or document, then notice that at the bottom of the panel that appears, you'll see several icons, which represent filters, or lenses, that categorize what is shown.  You can click on these, or press Ctrl + Tab to cycle through them.  The second one on the left is a list of all apps, and can lead you to any app either installed or potentially installable.\nIf you want to open a music file, and you know the name, it's better to search for this than to open an app, then search for the music file.  This is considered a more modern method of user interface; you don't need to care about the name of the application that is used to open your file.  In fact, the application name can change, but your method of opening the file doesn't need to change in that case.\n", "Q: How to configure Ubuntu?

Looks to me like it's stuck on clearlooks or something. I've had trouble occasionally with my theme not \"updating the windows\" \nIf you do not have MyUnity installed you can install it from the software center or run this code in the terminal:\nsudo apt-get install myunity\n\nThen run the program by searching Myunity in the dash.

They may also have more drivers but I can't say. I would recommend the default .iso which you can download from here: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop \nSimply \"Choose your flavour\" Either 64 Bit or 32 Bit depending on your system and then proceed to create a live CD or live USB and then install. And the instructions for doing so can be found here if you do not already know: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/install-ubuntu-desktop \nIf there is anything missing from the default .iso you can simply install them later, but most likely it is just the language packs. However all versions of Ubuntu newer then 12.04.XX will be too big to fit on a Cd so you will be required to create a live DVD or a live USB, as the .iso will be too big to fit on a single CD.\n", "Q: Android SDK file permission \nPossible Duplicate:\nGeneral Rules for dealing with File Permissions \n\nI have been trying to access the file for a while now and it says that I don't have the permission to enter the file.

I love the distro. Everything was fast, and then the bootup slowed down. It started taking a couple minutes for my user selected wallpaper to show and the menu to appear, basically do anything on the comp. I do not recall doing anything other than changing the swappiness. It did not affect it initially. Would that be something to affect it or are there other ideas that might have caused this sudden change. \n\nA: Yes, changing swappiness can slow down your computer. It is the threshold at which the system will swap data from the ram to the hard drive in order to preserve space. Data can be found, read and written much faster in memory than on the hard drive. Therefore it is best to keep data in memory and only swap to the hard drive when memory is very low. By default, swappiness is set to 60 and changing this value will determine how the system behaves in these situations. \nIncreasing this value will cause the system to swap more often. Even when it may be unnecessary. It will be more likely that the data you are seeking has been swapped out of memory. As I said earlier file manipulation is much slower on a hard disk so even simple tasks may take much longer than normal to complete.\nDecreasing this value will cause the system to avoid swapping data to the hard disk. Sometimes this is recommended to increase performance but this could backfire if you have little ram to begin with. So, low ram combined with a low swappiness value can result in a system that will run out of memory quickly, while being reluctant to free memory through swapping.\nI would recommend that you return the swappiness value to the default of 60. Monitor how the computer behaves. Hopefully you will see improvement.\n\nA: Decrease the swap use (very important!)\n1.5. This is especially noticeable on computers with relatively low RAM memory (1 GB or less): they tend to be far too slow in Xubuntu, and Xubuntu accesses the hard disk too much. Luckily, this can be helped.\nOn the hard disk there's a separate partition for virtual memory, called the swap. When Xubuntu uses the swap too much, the computer slows down a lot.\nXubuntu's inclination to use the swap, is determined by a setting. The lower the setting number, the longer it takes before Xubuntu starts using the swap. On a scale of 0-100, the default setting is 60. Which is much too high for normal desktop use, and only fit for servers.\nA detailed explanation can be found here (link dead? Then download this pdf file with the same content).\nNow the how-to:\n1. First make sure that you have installed the applications gksu and leafpad:\nMenu button - Accessories - Terminal Emulator\nType (use copy/paste):\nsudo apt-get install gksu leafpad\n\nPress Enter and submit your password. Please note that the password will remain invisible, not even asterisks will show, which is normal.\n2. Now check your current swappiness setting. Type in the terminal (use copy/paste):\ncat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness\n\nPress Enter.\nThe result will probably be 60.\n3. To change the swappiness into a more sensible setting, type in the terminal (use copy/paste):\ngksudo leafpad /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nPress Enter.\nScroll to the bottom of the text file and add your swappiness parameter to override the default. Copy/paste the following blue lines:\n# Decrease swap usage to a more reasonable level\nvm.swappiness=10\n\n4. Close the text file and reboot your computer.\n5. After the reboot, check the new swappiness setting:\nMenu button - Accessories - Terminal Emulator\nType (use copy/paste):\ncat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness\n\nPress Enter.\nNow it should be 10.\nNote: your machine might benefit from an even bigger decrease in swappiness. A useful rule of thumb might be this:\n1 GB RAM or more: set swappiness to 10\nLess than 1 GB RAM: set swappiness to 5\n\n", "Q: Parsing a HTML page with Bash I'm trying to write a Bash script that will extract informations from a HTML page (using wget).\nI know my informations will be between <h*> tags, but is there a nice way to get those ?\nTo be more precise let's have an example : \n\n< h1>header1< /h1>\n     < h2>header2< /h2>\n     < h2>otherHeader2< /h2>\n  < h1>lastHeader1< /h1>\n     < h2>lastHeader2< /h2>\n\nI'd like to extract \"otherHeader2\", a.k.a. the second (but it could be anywhere) header afer the header1.\n\nA: You should never parse html with regular expressions. Always use a proper html or xml parser. For example, using xmlstarlet:\n$ xmlstarlet sel -t -v '//h2[2]' html.html \notherHeader2\n\n\nA: this is a simple python script that will parse your html and put all the values into a list and print it out. You can either write the rest of your script in python, or call this script from python, or plug this short code as a snippet in bash. Check out the examples below.\ntest.html\n< h1>header1< /h1>\n< h2>header2< /h2>\n< h2>otherHeader2< /h2>\n< h1>lastHeader1< /h1>\n< h2>lastHeader2< /h2>\n\nparse_header.py\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport sys, re\nprint re.findall(r'< h\\d>(.*)< /h\\d>', sys.stdin.read())\n\nscript can be called from bash\ncat test.html | parse_header.py\n\npython code can be put into bash script\ncat test.html | python -c \"import sys, re;print re.findall(r'< h\\d>(.*)< /h\\d>', sys.stdin.read())\"\n\nthe last option I believe is not very readable in your case. It makes more sense if you have some simple code where it's not worth putting it in it's own script. \n", "Q: Installing applications on a usb drive I'm running Ubuntu off an 8gb USB drive but it's almost full; is there a way to install my applications on a different USB drive. It's been suggested that RAID 1 will work but will that just duplicate my files?\n\nA: Unlike Windows, there is no easy way to choose the installation directory in Ubuntu.\nA full install may be easier to manage. For example, you could uninstall the older kernels. the persistent USB works off the CD image and stuff that came in the ISO can't be easily removed even when they are updated. \nI suggest backup all the data saved in the USB somewhere else (may be another USB drive) and try full install: How do I install Ubuntu to a USB key? (without using Startup Disk Creator).\nOn RAID\nRAID 1 mirrors one drive to another in real time. So if one fails the other can take over its duties. So adding another drive in RAID 1 formation does not add any disk space.\nRAID 0 strips, that is divides up all the data between two drives. This makes reading and writing faster, but if one fails everything is history, as you will have half of each file.\nRAID was intended for identical internal drives that don't get moved around. USB drives and flash drives are external and intended to be plugged and unplugged and moved between computers. However, plugging and unplugging them may give them different internal IDs. If that happens one part of RAID0 won't recognize the other part and the system will fail as you will have half of everything, including the OS.\n", "Q: How to start Windows 7 after setting wait time = 0 After I installed 12.04, I think waiting a long time to choose between Windows 7 and Ubuntu is such a waste.\nSo I went into Windows 7 and set the default to Ubuntu and no waiting time (not the grub in Ubuntu).

I've got everything arranged beautifully in the following mantra: /Artist/Album/Track - Artist - Title.ext and if one exists, the cover sits in /Artist/Album/cover.(jpg|png).\nI want to scan through all the second-level directories and find the ones that don't have a cover. By second level, I mean I don't care if /Britney Spears/ doesn't have a cover.jpg, but I would care if /Britney Spears/In The Zone/ didn't have one. \nDon't worry about the cover-downloading (that's a fun project for me tomorrow) I only care about the glorious bash-fuiness about an inverse-ish find example.\n\nA: This is much nicer to solve with globbing than with find.\n$ cd ... # to the directory one level above the album/artist structure\n\n$ echo */*/*.cover   # lists all the covers\n\n$ printf \"%s\\n\" */*/*.cover # lists all the covers, one per line\n\nNow suppose you have no stray files in this nice structure. The current directory contains only artist subdirectories, and those contain only album subdirectories. Then we can do something like this:\n$ diff  <(for x in */*/cover.jpg; do echo \"$(dirname \"$x\")\" ; done) <(printf \"%s\\n\" */*)\n\nThe <(...) syntax is Bash process substitution: it lets you use a command in place of a file argument. It lets you treat the output of a command as a file.  So we can run two programs, and take their diff, without saving their output in temporary files. The diff program thinks it is working with two files, but in fact it's reading from two pipes.\nThe command that produces the right hand input to diff, printf \"%s\\n\" */*, just lists the album directories. The left hand command iterates through the *.cover paths and prints their directory names. \nTest run:\n$ find .   # let's see what we have here\n.\n./a\n./a/b\n./foo\n./foo/bar\n./foo/baz\n./foo/baz/cover.jpg\n\n$ diff  <(for x in */*/cover.jpg; do echo \"$(dirname \"$x\")\" ; done) <(printf \"%s\\n\" */*)\n0a1,2\n> a/b\n> foo/bar\n\nAha, the a/b and foo/bar directories have no cover.jpg.\nThere are some broken corner cases, like that by default * expands to itself if it matches nothing. This can be addressed with Bash's set -o nullglob.\n\nA: Let's make it simple and easy to understand.\nfor dir in /*/*; do\n  if [ ! -f $dir/cover.jpg ] && [ ! -f $dir/cover.png ]; then\n    echo $dir\n  fi\ndone\n\nMake it one line (note that we need an extra ; in the one-line version):\nfor dir in /*/*; do if [ ! -f $dir/cover.jpg ] && [ ! -f $dir/cover.png ]; then echo $dir; fi done\n\n\nA: Simple, it transpires. The following gets a list of directories with the cover and compares that with a list of all the second-level directories. Lines that appear in both \"files\" are suppressed, leaving a list of directories that need covers.\ncomm -3 \\\n    <(find ~/Music/ -iname 'cover.*' -printf '%h\\n' | sort -u) \\\n    <(find ~/Music/ -maxdepth 2 -mindepth 2 -type d | sort) \\\n| sed 's/^.*Music\\///'\n\nHooray.\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*comm's arguments are as follows: \n\n\n*\n\n*-1 suppress lines unique to file1\n\n*-2 suppress lines unique to file2\n\n*-3 suppress lines that appear in both files\n\n\n*comm only takes files, hence the kooky <(...) input method. This pipes the content via a real [temporary] file.\n\n*comm needs sorted input or it doesn't work and find does by no means guarantee an order. It also needs to be unique. The first find operation could find multiple files for cover.* so there could be duplicate entries. sort -u quickly ruffles those down to one. The second find is always going to be unique.\n\n*dirname is a handy tool for getting a file's dir without resorting to sed (et al).\n\n*find and comm are both a bit messy with their output. The final sed is there to clean things up so you're left with Artist/Album. This may or may not be desirable for you.\n\nA: Case 1: You know the exact file name to look for\nUse find with test -e your_file to check if a file exists. For example, you look for directories which have no cover.jpg in them:\nfind base_dir -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 2 -type d '!' -exec test -e \"{}/cover.jpg\" ';' -print\n\nIt's case sensitive though.\nCase 2: You want to be more flexible\nYou're not sure of the case, and the extension might be jPg, png...\nfind base_dir -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 2 -type d '!' -exec sh -c 'ls -1 \"{}\"|egrep -i -q \"^cover\\.(jpg|png)$\"' ';' -print\n\nExplanation:\n\n*\n\n*You need to spawn a shell sh for each directory since piping isn't possible when using find\n\n*ls -1 \"{}\" outputs just the filenames of the directory find is currently traversing\n\n*egrep (instead of grep) uses extended regular expressions; -i makes the search case insensitive, -q makes it omit any output\n\n*\"^cover\\.(jpg|png)$\" is the search pattern. In this example, it matches e.g. cOver.png, Cover.JPG or cover.png. The . must be escaped otherwise it means that it matches any character. ^ marks the start of the line, $ its end\n\nOther search pattern examples for egrep:\nSubstitute the egrep -i -q \"^cover\\.(jpg|png)$\" part with:\n\n*\n\n*egrep -i -q \"cover\\.(jpg|png)$\" : Also matches cd_cover.png, album_cover.JPG ...\n\n*egrep -q \"^cover\\.(jpg|png)$\" : Matches cover.png, cover.jpg, but NOT Cover.jpg (case sensitivity is not turned off)\n\n*egrep -iq \"^(cover|front)\\.jpg$\" : matches e.g. front.jpg, Cover.JPG but not Cover.PNG\nFor more info on this, check out Regular Expressions.\n\nA: ls --color=never */*.txt | sed 's|/.*||' | sort -u -n > withtxt.txt\nls --color=never -d * | sort -u -n > all.txt\ndiff all.txt withtxt.txt\n\nWill show all directories that do not have txt files in them.\n", "Q: How to install .deb file from within preinst script? I have my own application packaged using dpkg. The application depends on several .deb files which I'm trying to install from within the preinst script of my application. The preinst script checks if a dependent deb file is installed, if not it goes to install it using the dpkg -i command. This is repeated for all the dependent deb files needed by the main application.\nWhen I try to install the main application using dpkg -i, the commands returns failure when trying to execute the preinst script. Below is that error message:\ndpkg: error: dpkg status database is locked by another process\n\nI deleted /var/lib/dpkg/lock file and retried to install the application. But to no avail. If I run the preinst script separately like any other shell script, it runs without any issue. All the deb files will be installed properly. So, the issue is only when this preinst script is being run automatically by the dpkg -i command.\nI'm lost trying to determine the root cause. If anyone can shed some light on what the real issue might be, their help will be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you, ObsessiveSS0F for your quick response.\nI understand the point you are making but that will not help my situation. Let me tell you why. \n\n\n*\n\n*My main application (let's say mainapp.deb) depends on five other .deb files\n(let's say 1.deb, 2.deb and so on).\n\n*The dependent .deb files are my own private packages/libraries. So these are not \ndownloadable from the web. So, I cannot use apt-get to install these automatically.\n\n*I would make the \"Depends\" field in the control file to point to 1.deb, 2.deb..etc, \nbut as you know dpkg -i will not automatically install the dependencies.\n\n*I can execute dpkg -i, followed by apt-get -f install, but for apt-get to work, I\nhave to edit the /etc/apt/sources.list file to add a reference to the local directory\non the system where the dependent .deb files are stored.\n\n*Well, #4 seems to work but is not an option for me because this application will be\ninstalled on many servers and the installation program has to be fully automated.\n\n\nI continued to investigate the reason why preinst was failing to install the .deb files and I think I have found out why. \n\n\n*\n\n*When I run dpkg -i mainapp.deb,the dpkg process is creating the /var/lib/dpkg/lock\nand some files under /var/lib/dkpg/updates directory.\n\n*Now, the preinst script has a series of dpkg -i commands to install the dependent\n.deb files. So, as soon as the first dpkg -i command in the preinst script is \nexecuted, it fails because of the locks created by the earlier dpkg command.\n\n*It seems that two dpkg commands cannot be executed in parallel because of the locks.\n\n\nI modified the preinst script to backup the locks created by the dpkg process to a temporary location and deleted the original locks. (the lsof command did report that the\nlocks were deleted). Now that the locks were gone, the dpkg -i commands within the preinst script executed without any issues. I restored the locks back before exiting the preinst script so that the primary dpkg -i command could continue. It worked but I have a feeling that this is not the right approach.\nI'm still trying to figure out alternate ways for installing a .deb file along with it's dependencies.\n\nA: It is not needed to use a preinst script to install .deb files. You can simply add dependencies and then package using an archive, and any dependencies and pre-depends will be automatically installed.\n\nA: The thought of shuffling lock files makes me uncomfortable.  If it's guaranteed not to mess with the application install then it doesn't seem like there should be a problem however I believe that the pre-install script is more for things like stopping services that will be affected by the installation.\nIt seems the root cause of the problem is that the pre-install script is being shelled from the dpkg operation after the lock file has been set. It seems likely that the correct way of doing it is to either separate the installation of the dependencies altogether, or to re-package the application so that it works with a local ppa and installs the dependencies correctly.\nI am wondering if it might not be better to set up the dependencies with --set-selection and process them with dpkg either before or after installing the application.  The dependencies can be loaded with:\nsudo dpkg --set-selections < dependency_files\nWhere the dependency_files is in the format, for example:\nsamba                   install\nsamba-common            install\nsamba-common-bin        install\nsamba-ldb-tools         install\nsamba4                  install\nsamba4-common-bin       install\n\nI believe the files can then be installed with \ndpkg --selected-only\n\nIt might even be possible that your pre-install script can be used for the --set-selections part of the operation at least.\nAs for re-packaging, I can't be of any help there, but there seems to be a community of package maintainers the would be able to help:\nhttp://www.debian.org/devel/join/newmaint\nhttp://www.debian.org/support\n", "Q: Can't update Nvidia driver and having error near the end of the installation I had just got Ubuntu (first timer to Ubuntu so be very descriptive).

I think one can only merge partitions that are next to each other, not sure how to handle my case. \nAny suggestions? Is there anything I should pay attention to (such as not screwing up either Windows or Ubuntu system, not screwing up GRUB). \nI am using Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: Yes, the space does need to be contiguous to merge.  You will need to move a few things around, and do it in stages.  I wouldn't try to do it all at once, since some steps may take a bit of time.\nYou will need to do it using a live CD or live USB, as you can't mess with a mounted partition.\nI recommend first creating a swap drive at the end of the disk.  Then, highlight the old swap drive, choose swap off, unmount that partition, and delete it.\nYou can move the Ubuntu partition over into the unallocated space, then merge the space before Ubuntu with Windows, and merge the space after Ubuntu with Ubuntu.\nYou might also consider leaving them as is, creating a data partition using NTFS, then pointing both windows and Ubuntu to this partition for Documents, pictures, music, etc.  Windows 7 has a way to change the location for these directories, and you can create symbolic links in Ubuntu to point to the same place.  This makes it much easier to share data with both systems, and never duplicate data.\n\nA: Just because it may be interesting to know, given the time/effort it will take to do what you are planning:\nJust allocating the whole 400GB to Ubuntu should be pretty painless.\nYou delete the swap partittion, recreate it on the far \"right\" side and resize the ext4 partition.\nThis is easiest done in a live system, but if you need to you can evn do it in the actual system since ext4 supports online growing.\nThis process should be a lot faster than actually moving the Ubuntu partition.\n", "Q: Is the 64-Bit version of Ubuntu only compatible with AMD CPUs? I was told that computers with more than 2 gig's memory need a 64 bit operating system to utilize all RAM.\nIs the 64bit Ubuntu download really JUST for AMD processors? I am asking because the disk image I downloaded says AMD64.\nSo will my new Intel 2.3Ghz Core i3 Dual Core processor work with 64 bit Ubuntu?\nIt runs the 64bit version of Windows without any qualm.\n\nA: There is a slight misunderstanding here. AMD64 refers to the architecture of the processor. As AMD's X86-64 extension prevailed in the \"64-Bit format war\", it is named after them; just like people used to call all PCs IBM-PC-compatible.\nThe gist of the matter is: You can install AMD64 software on both AMD and Intel processors, as long as they support that type of architecture (Don't worry, almost all processors released in the last 5 years do). So just go ahead and install Ubuntu using the 64 bit iso.\nFinally, if your CPU has PAE enabled, you can access more than the limited \"4G\" of RAM using 32-bit processors.\nSee also:\n\n\n*\n\n*What are the differences between 32-bit and 64-bit, and which should I choose?\n\n*Difference between the i386 download and the amd64?\n\nA: Intel uses the same 64-bit instruction set as AMD. 64-bit Ubuntu will work fine.\nThe 64-bit instruction set currently used in desktop computers was invented by AMD, which is why it's sometimes referred to as \"amd64\", even though it is used by both AMD and Intel processors.\nA less confusing name for the same instruction set is \"x86-64\", reflecting the fact that it's 64-bit extension to the original x86 instruction set.\nYears ago, Intel developed an alternative 64-bit instruction set call IA-64 (brand name \"Itanium\") but it was never successful in the consumer market, and they have since standardised on the same set as AMD.\n", "Q: how can I record my acoustic guitar on Linux using Ardour and Rakarrak? I'm running Linux, and was recommended to use Ardour and Rakarrak for recording, but I haven't even gotten Jackd to recognize my guitar. Currently, the guitar is connected with a 1/4\" to 1/8\" cable directly from the pre-amp pickup in the guitar to the Mic In on my computer. Help!\n\nA: Can you record with jack using a generic computer mic plugged into the mic in port?  Your answer will let us know whether it is a problem with the configuration of jack or a hardware problem (perhaps your guitar's preamp isn't boosting the signal enough--or, more likely, is out of battery).\nIn any case, you probably won't get very good quality with this method, the analog to digital converters for the mic in line on most soundcards are pretty terrible--only intended for voice really.  You would have better luck using a linux friendly USB audio device.

With this, everything is working well and I can boot a Windows computer on the network to the \"Install\" screen for Ubuntu.\nHowever, I used the \"netboot\" image of Ubuntu that was available online, which uses PXELinux. In this image, the Desktop Ubuntu installer's \"Try Ubuntu from this device...\" option is not available, which means that from my PXE boot server I can't safely boot a computer into Ubuntu without first installing Ubuntu on the computer.\nIs there a version of the \"netboot\" image that includes a \"Try Ubuntu from this\" that would copy Ubuntu into the client's RAM without actually changing anything on their hard drive? Or, alternatively, is there a way to reconfigure my DHCP/TFTP server setup so that it will serve the basic Ubuntu LiveCD ISO file that has the \"Try Ubuntu\" option?\n(I am new to Linux as of this week, but eager to learn. The only time I had used it prior to now was for having an OS to use on a computer with a corrupted copy of Windows when I was in a pinch. So, I apologize for how much I do not know about all of this!)\n\nA: There is no official \"netboot\" installer image that comes with a \"Try Ubuntu\" selection. It is a minimal install image on purpose. It downloads & installs only the latest (updated) packages that you select. (A blessing for those who pay dearly for bandwidth or have data caps.)\nIf you boot with a netboot disk/USB stick, you should be able to press Alt+F1 - Alt+F7 or so to open up a terminal running a minimal BusyBox. For a first time user, that's a horrible first impression.\nHere's an alternative to trying out Ubuntu without downloading a single file or installing. Go to https://try.cloud.ubuntu.com . Canonical is providing free, 1 hour instances of Ubuntu to try out.\nIf you still like it, then it may be worthwhile to download the current or LTS Desktop version. You can always run it as LiveCD. If you have more than 3 or 4 gigs of RAM, consider downloading the AMD64 version (works with Intel too) instead of i386.\nIf you want to install it along-side Windows, but you:\n\n\n*\n\n*don't want to resize partitions\n\n*don't want to deal with the GRUB bootloader\n\n*want to remove it via Windows Add/Remove Programs\n\n\nPlease check out WUBI - http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer\nThe WUBI installer may be better choice.

This will tell you your connection information, similar to ipconfig.\n\nA: In 12.04, NetworkManager is the manager of network connections by default.\nThis is why you have only the loopback address in resolv.conf.\nInstead of looking into this file, check each of your network connections details in the following folder :\nls /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/\n\nand choose the connection you want to configure.

As I'm pulling out my hair here and really want to migrate my work PCs to a Linux OS as it just gives less issues than Windows does ever.\n\nA: First of all, I would like to suggest that you switch from SMBFS to CIFS, since the former is no longer under development.\nTo do so, you merely have to install the package called cifs-utils (supposing you are running Ubuntu >= 10.10, if you use 10.04 or earlier, just stay with the smbfs package).\nThen you can simply mount your share-- writable --with\nsudo mount -t cifs -o rw,username=username,password=password //<Server>/sharedir /mnt/fincon\n\nPlease mind the option rw, which basically gives you read and write access!\nYou also can put your share into fstab, but that would require you to put your password in plain text into this file, which can be read by every user on the system.\nYou could also use a credentials file, which can only be read by you and root, but I don't like this variant, since it still needs your password in plain text.\nYou could also mount the folder automatically at login, if your account password on your local machine is the same the password as for the samba share.

I suggest gdm, because you have Cinnamon installed:  \nsudo apt-get install <your choice here>\nIf your gui didn't start after xinit or startx, you need to install your preferred gui environment again.

Is it gone? Will it be back when I edit my /etc/fstab back to the Version without tmpfs? Will the space still be allocated on my SSD in a way that I can't use it for any other data?\nSometimes it is suggested to add the following line, too:\n\nnone /var/cache aufs dirs=/tmp:/var/cache=ro 0 0\n\nWhat does this actually do? I noticed that /var/cache takes almost 1GB of space on my harddisk. So should i clear the directory before activating this line? (this is related to the former question)\nThis causes me some confusions and I hope you can give me some clarifications.\nUPDATE \nI've downloaded a image with 600MB in size into /tmp that is mounted with the tmpfs settings above. Now I wanted to compare the RAM usage before and after the download. I expect the RAM usage to be increased by 600MB after the download. But the System Monitoring Tool showed me no changes at all.\nHow can this be? Does tmpfs work other than I actually expect it to?\n\nA: Mounts\nWhen you mount a file system at a point in a file system, the previous contents become invisible for the duration of the mount and reappear when the mount is absent. They do consume space on the file system though invisible.\n\nThe question thread you quoted seems to have a lot of very helpful information. Maybe I can add a little information given your questions.\ntmpfs\nThe contents of tmpfs file systems, as you mention, are not persistent--they always lose their data when the system is restarted.\nWhile I know of no drawback for storing /tmp in memory (except for the memory it consumes), the FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard) says that /var/tmp should survive reboots, so that shouldn't really be a tmpfs (mine is empty at this moment). /var/spool stores print jobs, and possibly other things. /var/log contains debugging information which is of no use unless you have a problem, but then may become very important. I wouldn't put any of these last three on a tmpfs, though I admit that the logs get a lot of writes.\naufs\nI'm not sure, but I think perhaps the aufs mount is meant to allow one to read from /var/cache/ while actually storing anything you write to it to /tmp/ (which would appear in both /tmp and /var/cache/). I'm having trouble matching the fstab entry you mention in your question with the man page documentation I get with aufs-tools version 1:3.0+20111101-1ubuntu1. I wish the article you quote had more information about this particular item. If you decide to use aufs and have trouble with the syntax I'd suggest you try Andrew Ferrier's fstab entry from the comments in the question thread you quote as it seems to better match the documentation I was able to find.\n/var/cache/apt/archive is used to contain .deb files for packages you have installed. If your system is like mine you will find a lot of the space here consumed by /var/cache/apt/archives. You can clean it out with sudo apt-get clean. A cache is useful for performance, but is supposed to only store replaceable items. The /var/cache/apt/archive cache allows you to reinstall versions of packages without having to download them again. If you want to reduce this space  with apt-get clean you would need to do that when there is no mount on top of /var/cache so the data can be seen and removed from the device and that space recovered.\nOther Items\nThe noatime option and related nodiratime option give up having the file system remember when a file is accessed (read), with the benefit that there are fewer writes to the file system, improving performance and reducing wear on the SSD. If you care about searching for files that have been read in a certain time frame you would lose that abiility. I don't find myself doing that.\nI see some suggest setting an option on your ext3/4 file systems to turn off the journal, which constitutes a fair number of writes, at the expense of recovering some data you have recently written if your system goes down.\nIf you look here, oldfred gives two commands that can be used with SSD's in post #2.\nsudo tune2fs -O ^has_journal /dev/sda1\nsudo tune2fs -o discard /dev/sda1\n\nchanging /dev/sda1 as appropriate, of course.\nThe first turns off the journalling I mention above. The second tells the kernel to communicate the deletion of file information to the SSD's controller so it can more optimally manage the device, giving better performance.\nMy Humble Opinion\nI think I would start with using tmpfs for /tmp, use the noatime mount option, turn off EXT4 journaling and turn on the discard option.\nI agree with JR0cket and definitely wouldn't put a swap file on the SSD for fear of shortening its useful life.\nI've made these changes to my flash drive and, due to the journal change, it has had to take a few more seconds to fix up my file system on boot, having had to reboot at least once. When I reboot or halt apparently the file sync hasn't completed before the system has halted or rebooted and after the last write to the file system. That hasn't been a significant problem for me and I haven't noticed any other repercussions from the other changes.\nI hope someone who has done this before or who knows about aufs will contribute more details in answer to your question.\n\nA: Beware of putting /var/spool/ on tmpfs!\n\nUser CRON JOBS are stored under /var/spool/ on Ubuntu!\nIf you put /var/spool/ on tmpfs you will not be able to have any user cron jobs because they will be erased on every shutdown.\nThe system crontab however is located in /etc/crontab and is edited directly NOT with the crontab -e command. found this out the hard way :-(\n", "Q: Enable Drivers on Lubuntu?

But if it is not behind NAT you need just to know IP address for connect to computer.\nYou can also use a service like: no-ip: http://www.no-ip.com/\n\nA: If you are using a Real/Public IP in your server, you can just access your server by IP address\n\nA: First of all\nYou should not use Webmin. The reason is that webmin easily breaks your system and do weird actions for simple actions. Plus it is not secure for online use.\nYou have ssh witch is quite enough (I assume that you said openssh server, if not install it)\nAs you can see you can enjoy a bunch of knowledge and people wishing to help : if you don't know how to do one thing google it, search here in askubuntu and if you can't find it ask a question here.\nThe Online issue\nYou need to configure internet on your server. For that you must specify the gateway and dns ips.\nIf your Ip is local :\nopen a console and type ipconfig. If you see something like 172.16.XXX.XXX or 10.XXX.XXX.XXX or 192.168.XXX.XXX then it's local (XXX being a number)\nIn that case you must access to your router and do some port redirection. THe port are the communications channels (TCP/22 for SSH, TCP/21 for FTP, TCP/80 for HTTP)\nAnd then you must know your public IP witch you can obtain by searching \"what is my ip\" with a browser\nIf your ip is not local then you are online and the IP of your machine is the IP that you must access.\n", "Q: Getting Windows games to play on PlayOnLinux I used Play on Linux and Starcraft II as a test to see if I can play my library of games on Linux...

The scenario for me is to use one at home, another at office. \nWhen comes to the launcher at left, the applications get added in chronological order. You can click and drag an application in launcher, but this is a tedious process.\nIf your application placements are different among the machines, you loose the intuitive mouse click.

How to Reset Launcher?!\ngsettings reset com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites\n\nMake remote script to launch at start up.\n\nObsessiveFOSS - The master script(the one directly run from Startup applications) is responsible for getting the remote script from the network share. If it can, it overwrites the local copy of the actual script with the actual startup items, and if it cannot connect for some reason, it just runs the old version.\n\nThe idea was to execute master script from network.\nFirst you need to create master .launcher.sh that's contain :\n#!/bin/sh\ngsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Launcher favorites \"['nautilus-home.desktop', 'firefox.desktop', 'gnome-terminal.desktop', 'gedit.desktop', 'Ubuntu Software Center.desktop']\" \n\nGiving permission:\nchmod +x ~/.launcher.sh\n\nMake startup application\n\nName : Launcher\nCommand : ~/.launcher.sh\n\nSo all you need is to change one script and other machine will follow too.

This is how I am doing it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Add (lock to launcher) to and rearrange (click and drag) applications in your launcher until you are satisfied.\n\n*Start dconf-editor.

If you have a 2nd fixed disk drive, normally D: in Windows, it would be called sdb.\nWhen you run the Ubuntu install, it will normally run a live version from the CD or USB, with an option to install permanently.  You can use disk tools to be sure that your Windows disk is indeed sda1.  Then, when you install, I believe there will be a choice to install onto sda, with an option to erase everything and reformat the drive to ext4, the default file system type.  This is what you want to choose.  This will not do anything to the 2nd drive, or any other drives.

However I don't know the ip address of the computer she's on it's dhcp and no static ip addresses.  I would like to ssh into the main desktop and work on it.  Sometimes I have asked her if I could get on for a minute to get the ip address.  From a terminal I do an ifconfig and get the address.    I could get it from the router too but that is requires logging into the router. There must be some short command I can run?  All the computers are  running Ubuntu and samba is not installed. Once I know the ip address I can ssh into the main desktop.\n\nA: you could try nmap, if you don't have it, it can be installed via the following :-\nsudo apt-get install nmap\n\nyou can then scan your network by issuing :-\nnmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24\n\nobviously change address range if your network differs\n\nA: Modern releases of Ubuntu use avahi, so one could also use avahi-discover\nsudo apt-get install avahi-discover\n\nand run with:\navahi-discover\n\nthis allows you to view all the machines on the network and see the IP address, MAC address and services running on these machines.\nAlternatively one could use:\navahi-browse -rat\n\n\nA: Just as apacheuk mentionned, using nmap is a great and efficient way.\nActually the -O option enables you to get additional informations such as the MAC address, the open ports, the OS type, the distance (in hops):\nnmap -O 192.168.1.0/24\n\nPlease note that you main need to be logged in as root or sudo in order to be able to do that.\n\nA: You can login to your router and look at the connected devices list\nHere is another way :\nYou can login using the computer name of the client\nSo run cat /etc/hostname on your wifes computer, you may get something like wife-System-Product-Name if that is the case you can run ssh wife@wife-System-Product-Name.local and login without using the ip address, that address only changes if you edit the /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts files or do a reinstall and give the system a new name\n", "Q: Can someone please tell me how to install xubuntu and ubuntu as two different operating systems? I want to be able to dice which OS to run when I turn on my computer. I want to keep my original OS (Windows XP) Please help me!\n\nA: 1) You can repartition your hard disk. Keep XP on partition 1. Then install Ubuntu / Xuvuntu on partitions 2 and 3 and use GRUB as a boot loader.\n2) Alternatively, install Ubuntu / Xubuntu in a virtual machine under Windows XP. Then no need to repartition your hard disk.\nOption 2 is easy (e.g. using Virtualbox) and does not mess up your XP install.\nOption 1 requires some skill. If you just want to \"try\" ubuntu to see how it looks/feels. go for option 2. Later you can then install ubuntu permanently using option 1 and still keep the XP available.\n", "Q: Do I have to leave a webapp open to get a status notification? With the integration of webapps, do I have to leave the webpage for facebook, twitter, Google+ or any other social media (or webapp enabled site for that matter) opened to get notifications or can I fetch or configured to fetch them without having the webpage opened?\nI ask since the notifications only arrive if I have the specific social media webpage opened.

I finally got networking to work, but the only page I can access is 127.0.0.1:8080. If I, for example, attempt to access http://localhost:8080/upload/install/install.php I get the following error:\n\nThis webpage is not available\n  The connection to 127.0.0.1 was interrupted.\n\nWhat should I do to gain access to all files in \"/var/www\"? \nI already tried some things with apache's config files but I guess I messed them up so I apt-get remove apache2 --purge and apt-get install apache2. \nI have also installed a complete LAMP server with phpMyAdmin, which I also can't access.\n\nA: The error message rather indicates the server being unable to reach. Are you sure you configured it to listen on port 8080? Check the following things:\n\n\n*\n\n*check your /etc/apache2/ports.conf what ports you have configured Apache to listen on. It's shown in the line starting with \"Listen\", and by default points to port 80\n\n*run netstat -a -t -n to check for listening services. The column \"State\" should show \"LISTEN\" here, and the column \"Local Address\" has your local services. In this column, the port in use is printed after a colon, so e.g. \"*:8080\" would indicate there is something listening on port 8080\n\n*check your Apache error log file for details. If not configured otherwise, you should find it in /var/log/apache2/error.log\nThe most likely cause is you set up Apache to listen on port 80 (which is the default), and now try to follow some tutorial which assumes otherwise. It might also involve configuring a virtual host, and you skipped this step (or didn't succeed here).\nIf, on the other hand, your configuration is to have Apache listen on port 8080, and it is listed by above netstat command properly, it could be some permission problem -- though that normally should be indicated by a different error. Just to make sure you can rule this out:\n\n\n*\n\n*check what user Apache is running under. This usually is www-data:www-data (i.e. user and group is www-data). Using the command ps -aeo \"%p %U %G %x %c\" |grep apache you should see all Apache processes, having the user and group in the second and third column.\n\n*check directory and file permissions. Either user or group should have at least read and execute on the directories, and read on the files. Having your DOCUMENT_ROOT in /var/www, for example, and accessing an index.html there, the file must be at least readable to Apache's user or group, and /var as well as /var/www should have read and execute permissions given.\n\n", "Q: Can't boot from liveUSB when trying to install it alongside Windows 7 I'm very noob at Linux and installing techniques. I want to install 12.04 from bootable usb flash alongside Windows 7 (also tried live CD but not working) but computer is not booting from USB flash or LIVE-CD and boots windows 7 (Acer Aspire 4750g) and of course I have set the BIOS priority in the right way.  \nThere is one important point to tell that I have installed Fedora 16 on my laptop successfully and now I have it on my system. When I was trying to install Fedora I got some error and searched about it and got this point that I should delete a .efi file and then installation went right.  \nIn this case , what should I do to solve the problem? (I also don't need my Fedora anymore).\n\nA: Before proceeding further, it's imperative that you determine how Windows is booting: in BIOS (aka legacy) mode or in UEFI mode. This is tied to the partition table type: In BIOS mode, Windows must boot from an MBR disk, whereas in UEFI mode, it must boot from a GPT disk. This is described in more detail here. Installing Linux in the wrong boot mode is likely to be a recipe for frustration; for best results, the boot modes of both OSes must match. If they don't match, you'll have to jump through extra hoops to get them to match or to switch your computer's boot mode whenever you boot.\nOnce you know the boot mode, the question becomes: How do you boot the Ubuntu installer in the desired boot mode? In some cases there are two boot options for CDs and/or USB drives in your firmware's boot-time boot menu, so once you access it (typically by pressing F2, F10, F12, or some other key at boot time), you can select the appropriate boot mode and continue. It's easy to overlook the distinction between these options, but one typically mentions \"UEFI\" (for UEFI) or \"legacy\" (for BIOS). Unfortunately, some firmware implementations don't give you the sort of control you should have, so you might not see these options. Also, there are sometimes bugs, particularly with UEFI boot mode, that can make it very difficult to get started; you may need to replace one EFI boot loader with another. Alternatively, you could install in the \"wrong\" mode (despite what I just wrote about that being bad) and then switch the boot mode later by manually installing the correct type of boot loader. Debugging such problems is system-specific and so is better handled in forums than on a site like this one.\n\nA: Enter the BIOS with F2 as the machine is going through post.  Enable the boot menu in BIOS and you will now be able to access the boot menu as the machine is going through post again with F12.\nSelect the boot device you want to boot from - either the LiveCD or the LiveUSB.\n", "Q: How can I tell what error grub has when I can't read what it's saying? Grub won't allow me to get into any systems on my HP dv7 (it runs 12.10).\nAs the screen is broken, I can't read what the error is. Nothing works, not even the recovery mode. It gives me some error about \"cannot find\" (I think) and Press any (I guess key?)\nWhen a press a key I'm dropped back to the menu. At the moment I'm trying all the recovery options I know. However, it would be great if someone could tell me how to know what error grub is facing from a live cd or something (maybe a log file or something could help)?\nNB:\nI can view the filesystem from a liveCD, and I did check the filesystem - it was clean.\n\nA: I ended up using boot-repair to fix the problem from a live usb. It turns out that the grub install had been corrupted during an upgrade and needed to be reinstalled cleanly.\n", "Q: OAuth/Authenticating user for Unity Lenses Trying to create a lens that would touch a web service that requires oauth authentication. \nAnd a search here, netted me this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity/Lenses\nI was using this tutorial to create a lense: http://saravananthirumuruganathan.wordpress.com/2011/08/05/tutorial-on-writing-ubuntu-lensesplaces-in-python/\nSpeaking with a developer with more experience than myself, he mentioned using the new Online Accounts in the control center, but that there wasn't much documentation on how to do so.  \nDoes anyone know where this documentation might exist?

The problem shows up as the device not being available to Ubiquity or Startup Disk Creator to make a bootable disk and the partition table can not be deleted in Gparted.\nPerhaps this is the same problem but with an SSD.  The solution might be the same: to erase the partition table directly and to write a new one with Gparted.

This computer is running on Lubuntu. Print Screen will do a screenshot and save it automatically. However, the default image file is saved as png. I'd like to save it as jpg automatically. \nI tried to look through the system preference and such but no luck. Is there any command or setting that I can change so that it will save as jpg instead of png? I'd prefer to not install any new apps like the search results have suggested >.< unless of course that it is really the only solution.\n\nA: I concur with @InkBlend: png should be the screenshot format of your choice. As pointed out by Inkblend:  \n\nNot only is PNG lossless, but it has none of the patent issues that have encumbered JPEG in the past. And PNG supports transparency, while JPEG does not.  \n\nBut, for whatever reason, if you'd still like to use jpeg, there is a way. I fear you will have to mess around with configuration files a bit, though. \nThis will also enable you to change the screenshot naming scheme and where they are saved by default.\nModifying image format\nShortcuts are defined in Lubuntu's openbox config file. First let's make a backup copy:\ncp ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml.backup\n\nOk, now for the modification. Open it up with an editor:\nleafpad ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml\n\nSearch for the following section: \n\n<!-- Launch scrot when Print is pressed -->\n<keybind key=\"Print\">\n  <action name=\"Execute\">\n    <command>...</command>\n  </action>\n</keybind>\n\n\nNote the <command>...</command> line. ... represents what was originally there. Replace ... with:\nscrot '%Y-%m-%d_$wx$h.jpeg'\n\nSave lubuntu-rc.xml, close your editor and update Openbox with the new configuration by running the following from a terminal:\nopenbox --reconfigure\n\nScreenshots taken with this modification will be named something like this: 2000-10-30_2560x1024.jpeg. Scrot will automatically choose the filetype defined by the file name.\nAdditional modifications\nIf you don't like this naming scheme, you can easily introduce other parameters into the file name. Here's an overview:\n   $f image path/filename (ignored when used in the filename)\n   $n image name (ignored when used in the filename)\n   $s image size (bytes) (ignored when used in the filename)\n   $p image pixel size\n   $w image width\n   $h image height\n   $t image format\n   $$ prints a literal '$'\n\nIf you want to define a different screenshot folder, e.g. your Pictures folder, you can do so with this command:\nscrot '%Y-%m-%d_$wx$h.jpeg' -e 'mv $f ~/Pictures/'\n\nRestoring previous settings\nYou can revert any changes by replacing the modified file with your backup:\ncp ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml.backup ~/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc.xml\n\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: Can't connect to wireless network with a Sabrent A111N USB Dongle I've been trying to connect to this network for quite some time.

I don't have a boot disk that laptop only have the recovery partition I think. So how would I install Ubuntu without losing the partition?\n\nA: I have an HP with Windows also installed on the same hard drive, HP also uses backup partitions. \nFrom my experience the Ubuntu installer seems to recognize the recovery partition as a windows file system and does not overwrite it. You will have access to the recovery partition at boot. I can't give you a screen shot but the bootloader (grub) will have: \n\nWindows (Version) loader on dev/SdaX (Where X is any number) \n\nand  \n\nWindows (version) loader on dev/sdaY (Where Y is any number other then X) \n\nand when you choose the loader on sdaY it should boot into the recovery partition which would include your boot repair/windows recovery/repair tools. Since the recovery partitions are alternate partitions it will not overwrite them. \nMy suggestion is that when you are installing choose the \"install alongside\" button so that it will roughly split your HD in half and put windows on half and Ubuntu on half. And during installation the bootloader (GRUB) will locate and determine which partitions are bootable and will give you the option of which to boot upon startup.\nIn the picture below I took a picture of my bootloader, the last 2 entries are Windows, the second to last is the actual operating system whereas the very last issue is my recovery tool/partition. Do note that one is located on /dev/sda1 and the second is located on /dev/sda2.\n\nHope that helps you out, if not please reply back.\n\nA: Well, Since 2 days , I am struggling with this issue and finally got fixed now.\nThere are two options. Each have its pros and cons. You have to pick up what suits you the best\nOption 1: In case your hard disk size is small, then you can delete your recovery partition.But then your windows wont work and you need to do some crazy stuff to get it back! And Its little bit dangerous too! But its not impossible and if you are ready follow this -  First you have to fix windows from windows DVD and then fix grub from Ubuntu CD - Follow the below link for more details\nOption 2: If you want to avoid all those, try to make a separate partition from C drive .

Would 40G be large enough or would a larger partition be better?\n\nA: First let's partition the new drive. As it's going to be a second drive in the system we just set it up like we want. If you're unsure about size requirements of your partitions use LVM. (I'm not going to cover it here.)\nThis will hopefully give you enough pointers to figure out what to do.\n\n\n*\n\n*Don't use dd unless you're making an identical copy of the old (let's say swapping disk to a faster, but of the same size). First partition new drive, then format the partition (for example ext4). Then the actual copy can be done with: tar -c --one-file-system -f - . | (cd /newPartitionMountPoint/; tar -xvf -)\n\n*New drive: no, Using dd for partition: No, After parted: Yes (unless that formats the partition automatically)\n\n*Well when you're change partitions that existed before, you also have to edit /etc/fstab\nuse blkid to see new and old UUID + LABELS and change fstab accordingly. If you had /boot on separate partition on /dev/sda that's most of it.\n\n*Partition size for root is subjective. I've actually never needed bigger than 20G root, but that means I have separate partitions for /var/lib (if database is needed), /data for my generic data needs and of course  /home\nMoving system around harddrives is easier in linux than in windows, but the most difficult move is moving '/' and '/boot'.

I also tried the Oracle PDF Extension for Open Office on my Libre Office.  The intention was to export as a PDF once the document was finalized.  It complains that I don't have the password to open the PDF.  This is unexpected since flpsed and calibre do not ask for a password.\nI also tried calibre to convert the PDF to RTF, for the purpose of editing or annotating the RTF with Open Office.  The intention was to export as a PDF once done. Unfortunately, calibre did a very poor job of the conversion, leaving out the grid lines which are essential in many corporate or government forms.  \nXournal was tried.  It does not seem to have an \"import image\" type of feature.  When I used the clipboard to paste an image, nothing happened.

The same error occurs with the clean install.\nSo how can I actually start unity after a system start that doens't start it directly?\n\nA: The startx command load only the default desktop environment without Unity or other user interface. The startx unity command can do this job, but I do not recommend it. You can test it and you'll see why.\nTo load with success the X display manager along with Unity from TTY, use next command:\nsudo service lightdm start\n\n", "Q: How to install Munin I need to install Munin on Ubuntu 12.04 for testing purposes.

Both run on Ubuntu 12.04 and both will need to update to 12.10 shortly.\nThere are some applications that are installed on one but not on the other and vice versa. But they share a large many applications.\nPlease indicate how can I upgrade both in such a way that:\n\n\n*\n\n*I download all the packages required on Computer 1\n\n*Move the downloaded packages to the other computer using external HD (that is much quicker than over WIFI)\n\n*Then upgrade Computer 1\n\n*Then upgrade Computer 2 -- after it downloads any packages that are not already available.\n\n\nAlso, I am a newbie and would be grateful if the process is simple and properly explained.\n\nA: Upgrade the first computer normally, then copy all of the .deb files that it downloaded to an external drive:\ncp -v /var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb /media/pendrive\n\nNext copy all of the .deb file onto the same directory on the second computer:\nsudo cp -v /media/pendrive/*.deb /var/cache/apt/archives/\n\nThen upgrade the second computer.  Of course, change /media/pendrive/ to the correct path for your deb backup device.\nThis way, the update will happen on the second computer but it will be able to re-use the .deb files that have already been downloaded without downloading them again.  Both computers must be the same release - either 32 or 64 bit.\nYou can also use this technique to update both systems normally.  Set one to update automatically if you wish, and the other one to not check for updates automatically.  Periodically copy the updated .deb files to the second computer and run the update.  If you keep this library of .deb files then you can also use it after installing a new machine to make the first update very quick - do not let the system do the updates during installation and instead do it manually after installation.\nI actually use scripts to maintain the .deb file backups, restore them, and even copy them to a new system while it is being installed.  Using cp with the -n switch it doesn't try to copy over items that are already there and is very easy to use and maintain.  Here's the one I use to upload the .deb files to the pendrive.  Note that the pendrive should have a volume name so that it's mountpoint is always /media/yourname - the script will accept the volume name as an argument eg\ndebupdate yourname\n\nThe script can also keep separate backups for different releases without getting confused - it stores the archives under /media/yourname/archives/kernel  where kernel is the major release level (ignoring the -xx extensions).  If you're worried about the .deb files being deleted you could run this several times during the update, or maybe automate it to do so.\nHere's the script:\n#! /bin/bash\n#copy the contents of the working archives to the given device\n#No files will be overwritten (existing will be skipped)\n#\nargs=(\"$@\")\nrel=\"$(uname -r)\"\nrelease=\"${rel:0:6}\"\n#\n# For releases with single digit third series, truncate the '-'\nif [ \"${rel:5:1}\" == \"-\" ]; then\nrelease=\"${rel:0:5}\"\nfi\n##############\n#\necho\necho \"Kernel release level is \"$release\n#\n#\n#\nif [ -z ${args[0]} ]; then\n    echo \"You must pass the volume name of target\"\nelse    \n    if [ ! -d \"/media/${args[0]}\" ]; then\n     echo \"Backup device ${args[0]} not found\"\n     exit 1\n    else\n     mkdir -p /media/${args[0]}/archives/$release/\n     cp -nv /var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb /media/${args[0]}/archives/$release/\n    fi\nfi\n\n\nA: I would look @ using apt-cache-server.\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Apt-Cacher-Server for more details. You update the first box, and then update the second, it will use the cache on the first. avoids duplication of packages.\n", "Q: \"No manual entry for pthread\" - could not find man page by name I am new to Ubuntu, wanted to code for reader-writer block in Operating System, but when I fired the command man pthread it gave me an error no manual entry for pthread.

There are applications, like Liferea that automatically change their language to match the system's, without altering any preference of the program itself:  Should this be the \"default\" behavior for all the programs?\n\n*Should there be an option on the program so as to let the user choose the language nonetheless?\n\n*Are all these translations coming along with the program itself? What if the user has set a system language not available in the translations of the program?\n\n*Is this Ubuntu or most-linux-distros specific?\n\nA: I know that application development with Quickly and Launchpad support Translations to do this. I'm no expert so check out these links in addition to my answer:\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/\nhttps://help.launchpad.net/Translations\nMy application imports the gettext module which then allows me to mark strings that will be displayed to the user in the program. When my program is submitted to Launchpad via Quickly, Launchpad is set up to automatically scan through the source code and generate special translation template files for the marked strings.  Kind Launchpad users (or the developer), can then use the template to generate translations for each string and language they'd like.  These translation files can then be sync'd to your source branch and merged before release.  On runtime the gettext module then replaces marked strings with the appropriate translation based on your system locale.  \nTo summarize, here's a list of the process:\n\n\n*\n\n*import gettext into your program\n\n*Mark strings that need to be translated\n\n*Setup translations in Launchpad\n\n*Translate templates and sync to source\n\n\nHere's the header of my program where I import gettext through locale (note that Quickly adds all this for me! locale and bindtextdomain are added because it's being put in /opt/extras.ubuntu.com I think):\nimport locale\nfrom locale import gettext as _\nlocale.bindtextdomain('drawers', '/opt/extras.ubuntu.com/drawers/share/locale')\nlocale.textdomain('drawers')\n\nNow I just mark text to be translated with _(\"text to be translated\") throughout my program.\n\nA: In the future, even if they are related, I'd suggest opening separate questions for each. In any case, I'll have a go at answering them:\n\nWhat should an application developed under a Linux System like Ubuntu do so as to automatically detect the system language?\n\nYou simply need to initialize gettext in your app. Gettext is the standard internationalization and localization technology Ubuntu and the big majority of other other Linux-based distros use (if we consider Android a distro,then it'd be the only exception).  \nIn the most basic case, and using Python \nimport gettext\nfrom gettext import gettext as _\nlocale.bindtextdomain('yourapp', '/usr/share/locale')\nlocale.textdomain('yourapp')\n\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*In Python, in order to support /opt installation you'll need to use the locale library instead of gettext (for most practical purposes they're equivalent)\n\n*There are gettext bindings for almost any programming language, not only Python.\n\n\n\nShould this be the \"default\" behavior for all the programs?\n\nYes.\n\nShould there be an option on the program so as to let the user choose the language nonetheless?\n\nNo. If you want to have such an option, you're on your own and will have to implement it yourself. The convention is that there is only one per-user language and you change that only in one place, affecting all apps in the system.\n\nAre all these translations coming along with the program itself?\n\nYes, they are shipped along with the app as binary .mo files, one for each language translated.\n\nWhat if the user has set a system language not available in the translations of the program?\n\nThen the default for gettext is to use English as a fallback.\n\nIs this Ubuntu or most-linux-distros specific?\n\nThis is the standard behaviour for Linux distros.\n", "Q: i added Hibernate option in Ubuntu 12.04 but not working i created hibernate option using _\nsudo gedit /var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/hibernate.pkla\n\nand i added this in that file_\n[Re-enable Hibernate]\nIdentity=unix-user:*\nAction=org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate\nResultActive=yes\n\nbut its not working. when i click on it, come to desktop page after some tym\nwhat need to do . is anything wrong?\nDisk /dev/sda: 320.1 GB, 320072933376 bytes\n255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 38913 cylinders, total 625142448 sectors\nUnits = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes\nSector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nI/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes\nDisk identifier: 0x426556e7\n\nDevice Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System\n/dev/sda1   *          63    81915434    40957686   83  Linux\n/dev/sda2        81915496   625137344   271610924+   f  W95 Ext'd (LBA)\n/dev/sda5        81915498   255995774    87040138+   7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n/dev/sda6       255995838   430076114    87040138+  82  Linux swap / Solaris\n/dev/sda7       430076178   625137344    97530583+   7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT\n         total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:       2025828    1372148     653680          0     135104     772580\n-/+ buffers/cache:     464464    1561364\nSwap:      4194300          0    4194300\n\n#free\n total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\n Mem:       2025828     864896    1160932          0      28972     380768\n -/+ buffers/cache:     455156    1570672\n Swap:      4194300      79680    4114620\n\n\nA: You need to edit files in: /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/.\nYou could do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the file.\n\n\n\ngksudo gedit /etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/com.ubuntu.desktop.pkla\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Type the following and save:\n\n\n\n[Re-enable hibernate by default]\nIdentity=unix-user:*\nAction=org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate\nResultActive=yes\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Log out and log back in.\n\n\nA: Might be a silly reason, but I had to update my graphics driver with the additional drivers program for mine to work. \n", "Q: Two equal items in alternatives list I want to have two JDKs.

Then, copy [or download if you don't have it] the Ubuntu ISO image for the version and architecture you want. Keep the file named as-is, and put  it in the same folder as the wubi.exe file you downloaded. Run that wubi.exe. It may complain:\n\nNo disk in drive\n\nbut click Continue on it a few hundred :) times to get to the correct screen. You can set your username/password/installation size, and use Ubuntu as the desktop environment.\nClick the button to proceed and then reboot when prompted. Two reboots(Windows->Ubuntu installer on your HDD->Ubuntu [fully functional]) will be needed, and you will be prompted when you need to reboot.\nVirtualBox\nYou can also install in VirtualBox using the default settings for everything, (both on the Ubuntu side and the VirtualBox side). I recommend the Ubuntu alternate CD for this one. You can then go to additional drivers and install the VirtualBox guest additions, and then without removing them, install the built-in ones with Right control+D. This hasn't caused Apt issues for me, and it helps alleviate the failure to install directly from the CD.\n\nA: Common partition table for dual-booting:\nThis works for most.\nPartition 01 (Primary)\n\n*\n\n*This is your C:\\ in Windows, formatted in NTFS.\n\nPartition 02\n\n*\n\n*A small system reserved partition (100MB) automatically generated by Windows.\n\nPartition 03 (Primary)\n\n*\n\n*Linux root partition used as \"/\", formatted from Ext4\n\nPartition 04\n\n*\n\n*Around 4GB partition used as \"SWAP\"\n\n\nA: There are 2 solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*During installation set Windows partition to mount e.g. in /windows\n\n*After installation mount windows partition and run:\nsudo update-grub\n\nHope it helped.\n", "Q: How do I import Amazon MP3s with Banshee and the new Amazon Cloud Player? Banshee's Amazon MP3 Import extension until recently allowed seamless importing of songs purchased from Amazon MP3.  It did this by a)opening .amz files and using them to connect to and download the purchased files from Amazon's servers, and b) using hooks in Banshee's built-in browser to automatically recognize and open the .amz files when clicked on in the browser.\nHowever, recently this functionality stopped working.  Banshee will display Contacting Server in the lower left hand corner for a little while and then stop.\nFurthermore opening the Amazon Cloud Player in the Banshee browser or any other browser on a Linux system to manually download the .amz file now results in the message:\n\nOn Linux systems, Cloud Player only supports downloading songs one at\n  a time. To download your music, deselect all checkboxes, select the\n  checkbox for the song you want to download, then click the \"Download\"\n  button.\n\nHow can I get around this and import my purchased music into Banshee as I used to?\n\nA: When you buy the album, you'll get to a page with a final acknowledgment of the purchase. In that page there's a link (\"download your music now\") to an .amz file that you can open in Banshee. \nI haven't found (or looked very hard) at a way to get that file again once you close that page, but the method above should be enough to get the music in a way close enough to the old/better way without messing around with an agent switcher. \n\nA: If you launch the cloud player (it's just a web app) and then find the music you bought, it can be downloaded as a file.  It's way less convenient than having banshee do it all automatically, but less annoying than messing with user-agent strings in a browser.  \nNote though, that if you try to d/l more than one track at a time, you get a message saying that this is explicitly disabled for Linux users. \n\nA: Steps 1-4 of the \"quick and dirty workaround\" work for me, too, in order to get the .amz file in the first place (on Ubuntu 12.10).\nBut step 5 doesn't, at least for Cloud Player .amz files. Some posts suggest there's a difference between purchased .amz files and Cloud Player .amz files.  Banshee (2.6.0) opens the .amz file, recognizes the tracks listed in it, indicates a download has started, indicates the downloads finished, without actually downloading anything.\nI tried clamz 0.5 and pymazon 0.9.1 and these gave me a better indication of what's happening, they log a 500 Internal Server Error when downloading each track.  The comments at the bottom of the Pymazon HowToAmzDownload pointed me in the right direction.  Installing jsphslgr's clone of pymazon yields a Pymazon that successfully downloads tracks from a Cloud Player .amz file.  Apparently it has to do with user-agent checking on Amazon's side.  So in short:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install FF User Agent Switcher\n\n*Switch user agent to IE 8 (before logging into amazon.com)\n\n*Pretend to install Amazon MP3 downloader (the amazon link that sets the cookie)\n\n*Clone the jsphslgr pymazon repo and install it\n\n*Set /usr/local/bin/pymazon as the helper for .amz files in FF\n\n*Select multiple tracks in Cloud Player and Download, FF will download the .amz and open in pymazon GUI showing the .amz's tracks\n\n*Configure pymazon to save files to your Banshee music folder\n\n*Click Download in pymazon, it will download and save all .mp3s listed in the .amz\n\n*Rescan music library in Banshee\n\n*Banshee has your new .mp3 files.\n\n\nA: This is not a technical problem.  Banshee is still able to open .amz files and use them to download purchased music.  However this problem results from a decision by Amazon to unilaterally restrict all browsers with linux user agent strings from being able to download .amz files.\nLuckily there is one immediate workaround, and a couple avenues for further action as well.\nQuick and dirty workaround:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the User Agent\nSwitcher\nextension for Firefox.  Any other user agent switcher/browser combination should work as well, I just have not tested them.\n\n*Use the user agent switcher to switch your user agent string to IE 8.  You can add the user agent switcher icon to your toolbar by right clicking the Firefox toolbar area and clicking Customize.\n\n*Authorize this pseudo-browser for use with Amazon Cloud player by clicking this link.  This tricks Amazon Cloud Player into thinking that you have already installed Amazon MP3 downloader--setting a cookie that will allow you to download .amz files instead of being prompted to install Amazon MP3 downloader first.\n\n*Use Amazon Cloud Player to select tracks and click Download.\n\n*Use Banshee to open the downloaded .amz file and it will automatically download and import the songs!\n\n\nPossibilities for more permanent solutions: \nThe fact that the above workaround can be used proves that this is not a technical issue but rather a choice by Amazon to restrict certain browser user agent strings from being able to download .amz files.  Therefore there a two paths towards a more streamlined fix for this problem.\n\n\n*\n\n*Modify the user agent string for Banshee's built in browser and then authorize it using the above link.  I don't know how to go about doing this but I'm hoping maybe something can write another answer for this.\n\n*Write Amazon asking them to explain this change and detailing it's\nnegative effects on you.  Here is the message I sent them:\n\nHello,\nI have been a regular customer of the Amazon MP3 store for awhile now.\n  Whenever I heard about a new album I would preview and buy the album\n  from your store. Part of the reason for this was the great Amazon MP3\n  integration with Banshee Media Player (http://banshee.fm). I could\n  browse Amazon, preview songs, and import my music all from within\n  Banshee Media Player. Having to use a third party client to download\n  music that I have purchased has always been a very big turn off for\n  me--hence, I don't like using Google Play, and before I discovered\n  Banshee's Amazon integration I didn't like purchasing music from\n  Amazon either.\nWith my most recent purchase however I was very displeased to discover\n  that Banshee's automatic import of songs purchased from Amazon MP3 was\n  no longer working. After a little research I determined that the cause\n  of this was that Amazon had decided to lock out any browsers with a\n  Linux user agents strings from being able to download multiple songs.\n  If I authorized and used a browser with a Windows user agent to\n  download the .amz file then I was able to open that file with Banshee\n  and import the songs normally. I understand the need to authorize\n  devices for use with the cloud player, but the decision to\n  unilaterally lock out linux machines from being able to download .amz\n  files seems completely arbitrary, and to this customer is a very\n  disappointing development.\nI'm not going to threaten to boycott Amazon MP3, in all likelyhood I\n  will continue to purchase MP3 albums from your service. However, from\n  this point on I will likely only purchase the promotionally priced\n  albums, I will now have no incentive to buy the full priced albums\n  (where you make the most money) from your service rather than another\n  service--especially those which have better support for linux.\nWhat really bothers me about this is that it is not a technical issue.\n  I am not expecting you to support another operating system, additional\n  software, or to make a version of the Amazon MP3 downloader for linux.\n  It is a matter of Amazon--inexplicably--choosing to restrict via user\n  agent all browsers running on Linux systems from being able to use\n  features that they otherwise are fully capable of using. To me this\n  seems not only unreasonable but also a poor business choice and not\n  what I expect from Amazon in terms of how you treat your customers.\nFurthermore, I am disappointed by the lack of an explanation behind\n  why this decision has been made. Linux users are greeted by a message\n  apologizing that support isn't offered, but given that support was\n  previously available, and applications such as Banshee are still\n  technically able to use the service if they use another browsers user\n  agent key to download the .amz while, I believe that we deserve an\n  explanation of why this change has been made.\nThank you for your time reading this. What I would like is both for\n  you to please convey my comments along the appropriate channels and I\n  would also like to receive a response stating, 1) why this change was\n  made, and 2) if there are any plans to re-enable Linux devices in the\n  future. Even if the answers to these two questions are not what I hope\n  to hear, a thorough response addressing these issues would likely keep\n  me a loyal customer of Amazon. I would however be rather disappointed\n  with a generic response that I could have found myself in an FAQ. As\n  such, please take your time if you need to ask around to find out more\n  about this situation before responding. Thank you again for your time.\nBest,\nAustin Dempewolff\n\nNote:\n I've written this answer up quickly to try and help those who are also facing this problem.  I would highly welcome other answers that are better illustrated and/or provide alternative workarounds!  I'd prefer to accept a better written/illustrated answer than this one!\n\nA: If you subscribe to the Banshee Team PPA then downloads are now working again as normal.\n\nA: I wrote a Greasmonkey Script that works around Amazons restrictions on downloading .amz files on Linux you can get it here:\nhttp://userscripts.org/scripts/show/426973\n", "Q: Backup /etc/ as normal user Deja Dup? I want a normal (no sudo) user to be able to backup /etc/ and their home directory using Deja Dup. Currently the home folder backup goes fine, but due to lack of permissions /etc does not get backed up.\nIs there a way to create a new group, say 'backupers' add the user to it, and then edit visudo to allow the group 'backupers' to use Deja Dup to perform such backups? \nAt the moment the user can look at files in /etc/ (say with gedit) but can't modify, and that is the way I would like it to stay. But them making a backup is handy.\n\nA: If your purpose in backing up /etc is just to protect against accidental error, consider using etckeeper to store it in version control. Install the etckeeper package, which will automatically set it up, and will automatically commit configuration changes. If you need to revert an erroneous configuration change, use sudo bzr on the /etc/ repository.\n\nA: Not sure if your problem persists but I add what I see on Ubuntu 14.04 for completeness. \nI can easily add /etc to my backup locations in deja dup and it does get backed up. However, there are folders that are not readable to anyone other than their owner, which makes sense e.g. for certain system services, user passwords or private encryption keys. It is not advisable to change their permissions to e.g. group or even world readability as this would lower your system security. For some files that have a limited group readability it is possible to add the users that need to backup them to the corresponding groups, like shadow, but that I still would not recommend.\nAfter the backup finished, there will be a screen showing the files that could not be backed up which you simply have to confirm every time.\n", "Q: How do I configure an Intel HD Graphics 4000? First off, please note that last night I already posted this question to a launchpad mailing list, so this could be considered a cross post. However, I think this is a better place to ask the same question\nThe question:\nHow can I configure my Ubuntu 12.04, with upgraded kernel (3.6), to use the Intel HD Graphics 4000 adapter? (Intel HD 4000 is the standard of 3rd gen Intel Core i7 (Ivy Bridge) graphics adapter)\nFor me this is the first step to getting things working with the 2 video cards the system has (one is in the docking station). If at all possible, I would like to use both adapters (see below). Apparently someone got that working on a predecessor model, but I can't seem to adapt that information to be useful for my system.\nSo eventually, I want to use all the computing power of all adapters that are connected, and be able to connect external displays to any adapter. I do not want to lock to the Intel adapter.\nSystem details\nI do get an X desktop on this laptop. However, dragging windows around and other animations look terrible. The system has two graphics adapters, the second one is an AMD Radeon HD 6700M in a laptop docking station. It doesn't matter whether I boot with/without the docking station connected, the X desktop I'm getting is on the built-in screen only and always looks the same.

So here is my question: how can I update code::blocks to the latest version from the terminal( if it's possible ).\n\nA: Here you got two possible actions.\n\n\n*\n\n*Keep updating your system , once Ubuntu have build the new code blocks , It will place it in upcoming updates . so doing regular update will give you i.e by the Ubuntu updates .\n\n*If you hate waiting , then you can get the packages from the codeblock site and then you can install by your own .\nIf you like action 2 then here you go .\nopen your terminal and type this \nwget http://space.dl.sourceforge.net/project/codeblocks.berlios/codeblocks-10.05-1-debian-i386.tar.bz2\ntar -xvf codeblocks-10.05-1-debian-i386.tar.bz2\ncd codeblocks-10.05-1-debian-i386\n./configure\n make \nsudo make install\n\nhope that helps .\nPS:If you faced any problems while installation then report us back . we will help you .\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: GParted doesn't start when I click the GParted icon I am using Ubuntu 12.04 and I have noticed that sometimes application doesn't start even after clicking the icon, what might be the problem. For example when I try to open GParted through the unity even after providing the correct password it doesn't show up but when I try to open through the terminal sudo gparted it opens up nicely after providing the password.\n\nA: You can edit the desktop entry /usr/share/applications/gparted.desktop and substitute the entry gparted-pkexec with gksudo gparted. That should allow you to call the program from the Unity dash without problems.\n", "Q: Copy Songs from iPod? I've found a lot on the web about being able to manage your iPod through Ubuntu. Is it possible to take songs off the ipod onto disk in a usable form, as my song drive has crashed1 and that's the only back up I have.\nThe closest question I found has the answer using gtkpod (Same with this one), but looking in the software centre reviews, that seems busted in 12.04 and I don't want to throw something buggy at my iPod. \nIf it makes a difference, it's an iPod classic.\n1Yes, I know I should have been taking regular back ups to either the cloud or another disk.\n\nA: The standard Ubuntu music player, Rhythmbox, is able to do that. Just select all the songs/artists you want to copy from your iPod and drag them to the Music tab under Library (all on the left hand side). Once it's done, you can find them in the folder that's under \"music library\" (edit > preferences > music). Rhythmbox also syncs. I don't use that myself but that might be even easier.\n\nA: Songbird Media Player is a media player which can manage iPods on Linux but they discontinued their stable Linux version. So you may be able to manage your iPod with Songbird on Linux by using an old stable version (the last one is 1.4.3 if I remember well) or by using a more recent but unstable Linux build of Songbird. Have also a look at Nightingale, a functionnal fork of Songbird on Linux and which might handle iPods too.\n", "Q: gsettings key not listed in dconf I wonder why in my beta of 12.10. the gsettings key com.canonical.indicator.session is not listed in dconf-editor. I can switch the value via:\ngsettings set com.canonical.indicator.session suppress-logout-restart-shutdown true\n\nbut cannot edit via dconf. That's strange for I remember having altered it via dconf in 12.04\n\nA: My understanding of this is that while gconf copied the entire tree to your home directory, dconf doesn't. So there are a bunch of things that dconf-editor just doesn't see as it may or may not be in your home directory (dconf-editor only seems to work on this scope).\ngsettings seems to give MUCH more consistent results...\n\nA: I'm not sure at which release its dconf path was changes. You can check that (I used Ubuntu 14.04 for the example):\n\n\n*\n\n*Check its schema path\n$ grep -r com.canonical.indicator.session /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/\nBinary file /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/gschemas.compiled matches\n/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/com.canonical.indicator.session.gschema.xml:  <schema path=\"/apps/indicator-session/\" id=\"com.canonical.indicator.session\">\n/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/com.canonical.unity-greeter.gschema.xml:      <default>['ug-accessibility', 'com.canonical.indicator.keyboard', 'com.canonical.indicator.session', 'com.canonical.indicator.datetime', 'com.canonical.indicator.power', 'com.canonical.indicator.sound', 'application']</default>\n\n\n*So it should be in /apps/indicator-session/\n", "Q: How do I preload a program for faster start?  Is it possible to \"preload\"(actually not preload, but kinda emulate the startup) e.g. nautilus (or firefox) startup at login, so the first time I launch it myself it launches faster? Probably to start it on another desktop and close after some seconds?\n\nA: install the preload package\nwith a console type :\nsudo apt-get install preload\n\nAnd that's it. THe package will preload the applications the most used applications after calculating the usage statistic.\npreload an application use ram memory and behave differently than \"cold\" or \"warm\" start an application.\n\n\n*\n\n*Preload = putting everything in memory from the hard drive. Your application is garanteed to be run as fast as possible.\n\n*Cold Start = loading from hard drive to the memory\n\n*Warm Start : reusing what's left on memory and load what's missing from hard drive to ram memory. Your application may run faster if linux didn't had to empty the corresponding cache for another app.\n\n\nThe Cold Start impact is due to the hard drive speed and latency. You can purchase a good SSD drive in order to speed up cold start (it has a real overall impact on the latency of the system)\nBest regards.\n", "Q: Overheating in HP Pavillion DM4-2102EO laptop The features are \n\n\n*\n\n*Intel Core i5\n\n*AMD Radeon\n\n\nTemperatures are \nacpiz 55°C\ncore 0 55°C\ncore 1 56°C\ncore 2 54°C\nRadeon 66°C\n\nIs that ok, what can I do? This did not happen on Windows 7 and the laptop is a new brand.\n\nA: I know this is quite a late answer to your question but in case you still were having these issues and needed an answer:\nHaving a laptop overheat is never a good thing, although when running CPU/GPU intensive tasks I don't consider going up to 55°C-60°C as being too excessive, as long as you don't stay above that limit for too long you won't damage your hardware as far as I know. \nIf you'd like to be able to regulate this and make sure that your laptop stays quite a bit cooler when not doing anything particularly CPU/GPU intensive. I'd recommend an applet called Jupiter (here's a quick introduction explaining what it does). \nThe official Jupiter applet site also gives you some clear information on what it does, I've taken a screenshot below to save you a click:\n\nTo give you an idea of what reducing my CPU usage has done: \nOn average when not in \"Max Performance\" mode my CPU temperature is 37°C, I used to have similar temperatures to your laptop beforehand and I've found from personal experience that it greatly improves your battery-duration as an added bonus when on the go.\nI've tried this on my HP pavillion DV6000 in case you were wondering, so going by the assumption that similarly branded laptops will work in similar ways with this applet I'd give it a try. \nHeres the site if you want to add the PPA to your Ubuntu distro and give it a try, I wasn't expecting much when I did install it, but it turned out to be the best power/heat management solution out there (as of 31/10/2012).\n", "Q: How to add information indicators to a Launcher icon from a script? Some applications place informational text over their icons in the Launcher.\nFor example, Thunderbird shows the unread message count, and Update Manager shows the number of updates available and a progress bar. The image shows these two examples:\n\nI have created some Bash scripts that use yad (a Zenity fork), which adds an icon to the Launcher while running.\nI would like to know how I can create my own information overlay within my script for those icons.\n\nA: This is for Python, perhaps something can be found for another language..\nFrom the update-manager source, UnitySupport.py:\nYou need to:\nfrom gi.repository import Dbusmenu, Unity\n\nto get Unity support.\nYou can then define a function:\ndef set_launcher_icon_num(self, num_count):\n    self._unity.set_property(\"count\", num_count)\n    if num_count > 0:\n        self._unity.set_property(\"count-visible\", True)\n    else:\n        self._unity.set_property(\"count-visible\", False)\n\nAlso, to show urgency(shake the icon), \nself._unity.set_property(\"urgent\", urgent)\n\nor to create a progressbar,    \nself._unity.set_property(\"progress\", progress/100.0)\n\nwhere progress is from 0 to 100. You can then use:\nself._unity.set_property(\"progress_visible\", True)\n\nto show the progressbar and use False instead of True to hide it.\nAs always, searching the source of a program that does what you are trying to do can be worthwhile.\nThese are subject to change at anytime. You can also see the Unity API.\n\nA: I don't think you can do it through bash directly, you have to interface with the API.  There are python bindings through gi introspection.  See this page which has python and vala examples:  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity/LauncherAPI\n", "Q: How do I copy music files in order? Is there a command to copy music files in order? \nI need to copy MP3s which are in folders by \"Artist - Album\" to a USB stick. \nThe MP3s must be copied in order, for example 01 Can You Feel It.mp3 should be copied before 02 Skyway.mp3.\n\nA: You can't copy files in order with commandline or nautilus. But you can use midnight commander to copy some files in order. Install it on terminal with this command:\nsudo apt-get install mc\n\n\nA: If you can't find any ready-to-use software to do this, you can very easily write one. \nIn python, a script to recursively copy all files with there respective folders to a new folder in order, could look like this:\n#/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport shutil\n\ntry:\n    from_path = os.path.expanduser(os.path.expandvars(sys.argv[1]))\n    to_path = os.path.expanduser(os.path.expandvars(sys.argv[2]))\nexcept:\n    print \"Usage: copyinorder <from path> <to path>\"\n    exit()\n\nif not os.path.exists(to_path) or not os.path.exists(from_path):\n    exit(\"Error: both paths must exist.\")\n\nfor dir_path, dir_names, file_names in os.walk(from_path):\n    if file_names:\n        new_dir_path = os.path.join(to_path, os.path.relpath(dir_path, from_path))\n        if not os.path.exists(new_dir_path):\n            os.makedirs(new_dir_path)\n        for name in sorted(file_names):\n            dest = os.path.join(new_dir_path, name)\n            src = os.path.join(dir_path, name)\n            shutil.copyfile(src, dest)\n            print \"copied {0} \\n to {1}\".format(src, dest)\n\nYou could just save it somewhere (e.g. as \"copyinoder\"), make it executable (e.g. chmod +x copyinorder) and run it like this:\ncopyinorder ~/Music/DavidBowie /media/N900/Music/\n\nNote that in this case the \"DavidBowie\" folder will not be recreated. \nNote also, that if the files are not as nicely named as in your example, then sorted might not be the order you wanted.\n\nA: This bit of code should do what you're looking for.  Modify the sort portion to alter the sorting behaviour to taste.\nfor i in \"$(ls *.mp3 | sort)\"; do cp \"$i\" \"/destination/$i\"; done\nETA: This might only work on a single directory at a time, but you can try ls -R, though I don't know if that would copy recursively.\n", "Q: How do I modify these VPN connection settings for Xfce?

In less than a second the problem is fixed.\n\n\nA: If you dual boot ubuntu alongside windows 10 it's probably windows 10's fast start-up that's holding onto your filesystem , it doesnt unmount your hard disks properly.\nto fix this you need to boot into windows 10\n\n*\n\n*Start > Power Settings \n\n*click on Additional power setting on the right\n\n*click on choose what thepower buttons do on the left\n\n*clock on change settings that are currently unavailable\n\n*unmark turn on fast-startup\n\n*save changes\nand then reboot into ubuntu everything will work fine!\n\n\nA: If you want to force your root filesystem to remount as rw, you can do the following.\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\n\nA: Usually linux puts your filesystems in read only when errors occur, especially errors with the disk or the filesystem itself, errors like a wrong journal entry for example.\nYou better check your dmesg for disk related errors.\nGoogle is full of discussion about this and you can pick the ones that is closer to your configuration, but a look at dmesg is usually enough.\n\nA: For me,Rebooting a system solving this issue\nsudo reboot\n\nas he mentioned about it.\nRemember\n\nas System Administrator rebooting should be the latest Solution\n\n\nA: If you were in situations that can not use live disc, e.g. you are remotely ssh into your system, you can still using the command that @Bibhas had answered: \nsudo fsck.ext4 -f /current/filesystem/mount/point\n\nIt will prompt for fixing your filesystem error. You also need to reboot your system remotely. \n\nA: Try running dmesg | grep \"EXT4-fs error\" to see if you have any issues related to the filesystem / journaling system itself. I would recommend you to restart your system, then. Also, sudo fsck -Af answer by ObsessiveSSOℲ won't hurt.\n\nA: Note that sometimes this can be caused by the computer forgetting the system time - disk check fails because the dates in the journal are in THE FUTURE! \nSetting the BIOS time (and checking the BIOS battery) fixed this problem for me, without having to do any disk recovery.\n\nA: The filesystem will usually go into read-only while the system is running if there is a filesystem consistency issue. This is specified in fstab as errors=remount-ro and will occur when a FS access fails or an emergency read-only remount is requested via Alt+SysRq+U. You can run:\nsudo fsck -Af -M\n\nto force a check of all filesystems. As one of the other answers states, looking at dmesg is also very helpful.\nEdit: Don't forget the -M on the command-line.\nNOTE: As mentioned by Bibhas in his answer: If fsck gets stuck after its version banner:\n$ sudo fsck -Af -M\nfsck from util-linux 2.20.1\n\nyou may want to try using the EXT4-specific fsck\n$ sudo fsck.ext4 -f /dev/sda1\n\nProvided the partition in question /dev/sda1 was an ext4 filesystem.\n\nA: In my case it was down to RAID 1 stabilizing after the initial installation. I have /boot and / on s/w RAID1. Having left the system overnight and rebooted, everything is working fine.\nRichard \n\nA: It looks like some mounted files have got corrupted, and as a result, the kernel has set the file system to RO to prevent further damage. To find which file system is corrupted, we could run:\ncat /proc/mounts | grep -i ro\n\nThe output would be similar to the below:\nproc /proc proc rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0\n/dev/sda1 / ext4 ro,relatime,data=ordered 0 0\ntmpfs /sys/fs/cgroup tmpfs ro,nosuid,nodev,noexec,mode=755 0 0\n\nOne of the solutions for this issue could be to remount the corrupted file system.\n\nA: I have had this problem on my computer for over 1 year and tried everything to solve the problem. Suddenly Linux goes into read-only mode. If you are editing something you are unable to save and have to execute fsck command and reset the computer. The computer is also very slow and freezing all the time. I removed the dual boot and left only Ubuntu, upgraded Ubuntu from version 18.04 LTS to version 20.04 LTS, and it didn't work. What was crucial to solving the problem is the use of the dmesg command. The experience didn't work out for me, just this command. The function of this command is to monitor the computer.\nIn my case, the problem was related to the SSD incompatibility with Ubuntu. I used HDD and after I switched to SSD the problem came up. The problem was solved by updating the SSD firmware, which was only possible by partitioned Windowns, because Kingston does not have the program to update firmware through Linux. I also installed the dual boot Windowns and Linux, first installing Windows over the entire SSD, then deallocating space through Windowns and installing Ubuntu,  but it is very unlikely that this was the solution to the problem.\n\nA: Check if you have any faulty hardware.I got this error due to a hardisk loosening. Ran mount -o remount,rw / and it worked fine.\n\nA: I am using the 18.04 LTS release and what I did was, first I unmounted my damaged drives then I went into “Disks” app by seaching in the dash. From there I selected the drive which was damaged. Make sure it is unmounted else it won’t work. In the options menu (the little gear shape), and clicked on “repair file system”. Boom! Worked like a charm.\n\nA: It's misconfigured boot settings (try mounting / as ext2) not drive or partition physical error.\ndmesg | grep \"error\" gave me:\next3-fs (sda2): error: couldn't mount because of unsupported optional features (240) \next2-fs (sda1): error: couldn't mount because of unsupported optional features (240) \next4-fs (sda2): mounted file system with ordered data mode: opts: (null)\n\nIt mounted / as read only due to the fstab error=mount-ro directive.\n", "Q: How to set MANPATH without overriding defaults? I have added extra directories to $PATH by exporting PATH=/my/dirs:$PATH\nBut I am not sure if I should do the same to MANPATH. Because default MANPATH is empty yet man command works. I found a command called manpath and its manual says If  $MANPATH  is set, manpath will simply display its contents and issue a warning.. Does this mean setting MANPATH is not the right way to add directories for man command to search for manual pages?\n\nA: While the title specifically mentions the MANPATH variable, I believe what the original author of the question was partly alluding to was whether there is a way to \"add\" a manpage to the system without touching the MANPATH variable in the first place.\nTherefore, in addition to the accepted answer, I would point out that, in a standard configuration, the manpage command also seems to look at directories in your PATH.\nI have not come across the relevant documentation for this, but from personal experimentation, I think the way this works is as follows:\nAssume you have a directory in your PATH called /dir1/dir2/dir3/dir4.\nThen, dir4 as well as its parent (i.e. dir3) will be searched by manpath, and if one of those directories contains a sub-directory called man or share/man, then the 'man' directory in question will be added to the output of the manpath command.\nIn practice this means that, e.g., if /home/user/.local/bin is in your path, and you also have a directory called /home/user/.local/share/man, any manpages contained there will be picked up. Similarly, if something like /opt/nano/bin is in your path, then /opt/nano/share/man will be picked up.\nNote that by \"picked up\", I mean that the manpath command will include that directory in its output! The content of those directories still needs to be compatible with man for man to pick up valid manpages from within them. In other words, your home/user/.local/share/man directory should contain a man1 directory containing lots of .1 files, a man5 directory containing lots of .5 files, etc, in groff format.\nUPDATE: As per the comments below, the manpath man pages now fully document this behaviour as of man-db 2.10.0.\n\nA: If you simply set MANPATH, it overrides the default and you lose access to the standard man pages. For example, man ls works before setting MANPATH, but does not work afterwards.\nTo append a search directory without overriding the default, prefix a colon to MANPATH like this:\nexport MANPATH=\":/path/to/custom/man\"\n\nAdding the colon gives you access to both the standard system man pages and the custom pages referenced in the MANPATH variable.\nThis answer brought to you by manpath(1):\n\nIf  $MANPATH  is  set,  manpath displays its value rather than\n  determining it on the fly.  If $MANPATH is prefixed by a colon, then\n  the value of the  variable  is  appended  to  the  list determined\n  from the content of the configuration files.  If the colon comes at\n  the end of the value in the variable, then the determined list is\n  appended to the content of  the  variable. If  the  value  of  the \n  variable  contains  a double colon (::), then the determined list is\n  inserted in the middle of the value, between the two colons.\n\n\nA: You should add your custom directories at the end of your PATH:\nPATH=$PATH:/my/dirs\n\nThis is so your custom directories do not override system binaries and libraries, which could cause a security issue.\nYou set MANPATH the same way (MANPATH is empty by default):\nMANPATH=$MANPATH:/my/dirs\n\nYou should not need to set a MANPATH with well behaved packages, so if it is not broken don't fix it. If it is broken, perhaps you are better filing a bug report ;)\nAdd this to ~/.bashrc:\nexport PATH=$PATH:/my/dirs\nexport MANPATH=$MANPATH:/my/dirs\n\n", "Q: How can I get Geforce gt630m working?

I got quite a few requests for setting up a PPA. I thought I'll do it for the upcoming release. Artha in Ubuntu's repository is of version 1.0.2 and I'm trying to create a PPA for Artha 1.0.3.\nI read Launchpad's Personal Package Archive docs, and the PPA is now set up, but this page on versioning says that for a package like Artha which is already in Ubuntu's repos, named artha-1.0.2-1ubuntu1 the PPA version should be artha-1.0.3-1ubuntu1ppa1, so that when Ubuntu's repos update to 1.0.3 of Artha, it supersedes my PPA's package.\nWhen I usually make my .deb package, I get these files \n\n\n*\n\n*artha_1.0.3.orig.tar.bz2\n\n*artha_1.0.3-1.debian.tar.gz\n\n*artha_1.0.3-1.dsc\n\n*artha_1.0.3-1_amd64.build\n\n*artha_1.0.3-1_amd64.changes\n\n*artha_1.0.3-1_amd64.deb\n\n\nand their equivalents for i386. This page on uploading to a PPA says that the files .dsc, .changes and .debian.tar.gz will be uploaded.\nHere's my confusion. How'd I make these files have the aforementioned version? i.e. with the \"ppa\" suffix? Surely, I feel, manually renaming Artha's source package extracted directory doesn't seem the right way.\nAlso should I debuild -S -sd or debuild -S -sa? The Launchpad page says alternative version of an existing package should use the former. This sounds ambiguous for me. What does this mean? Does an updated version count as an alternative version?\nThere're many detailed pages on setting up a PPA. But they're for setting up only once, while PPAs are all about giving updates to a particular package faster and maintainability is very important, I'd be great if someone could point me to such a document which talks about making updates, etc. i.e. about things that happen to a PPA after the initial upload.\n\nA: The version of the resulting package comes from the version number provided in debian/changelog So you must have the appropriate version there.\n1.0.3-1 will supersede an Ubuntu only upload versionized 1.0.3-0ubuntu1\n$ dpkg --compare-versions 1.0.3-1 le 1.0.3-0ubuntu1 || echo \"False\"\nFalse\n\nBut it will not supersede a version originating from Debian with Ubuntu changes, i.e. 1.0.3-1ubuntu1\n$ dpkg --compare-versions 1.0.3-1 le 1.0.3-1ubuntu1 || echo \"False\"\n$\n\nThe tilda (~) character has a special meaning in version numbers. For example:\n$ dpkg --compare-versions 1.0.3-1 le 1.0.3-1~ppa1 || echo \"False\"\nFalse\n\nAs your package is not originating from Debian, I go with a version number like 1.0.3-0~ppa1 This guarantees that it is less than either a version synced directly from Debian or introduced in Ubuntu,\nSo your change log should look like:\nartha (1.0.3-0~ppa1) quantal; urgency=low\n\n  * New upstream release.\n\n -- Your Name <foo@bar.com>  Sun, 07 Oct 2012 13:06:56 -0400\n\n\nWhether to use debuild -S -sd or debuild -S -sa is really a different question, but here's a brief answer.\n-sa ensures that the .orig.tar.bz2 will be uploaded. If you haven't made an upload of this upstream version before, use this.\n-sd explicitly makes it so that only the debian.tar.gz or diff.tar.gz are uploaded. This is for when you are making a change to an upstream version that is already available in you target archive or PPA. This is because th original tarball should already be present there.\n", "Q: Wayland performance on video cards I have read way too many reports/blogs/news about it, but have yet to come up with a way to be sure so I will ask here: Will Wayland have any performance enhancements with video cards (higher FPS, better quality, less resource usage) in comparison to using X?\nUpdated posts include:\nUbuntu 13.04 Will Enable Wayland Support In GTK+\nGood news in launchpad regarding Wayland Support\n\nA: The wise answer is to say : It's too soon to tell.

I would also like to know if this can be done in Chromium or does it restrict similar to chrome?\n\nA: \nA workaround has been created, but it is not pretty. To bypass the\n  protection, you need to download the extension or userscript to the\n  local system. Once there, you need to drag and drop it into the\n  chrome://chrome/extensions/ page in the browser. If you drag and drop\n  it elsewhere, nothing will happen.\nWhen you drop it on the extensions page, you will notice an install\n  option popping up there.\nWhen you select that option, you will see the standard installation\n  dialog that informs you about the rights that the script or extension\n  is requesting.\n\nSourced from: Chrome Fix: Extensions, apps, and user scripts cannot be installed from this web site.\nEdited on 20121125:\nI came across another way which requires starting the browser from the command line.\nFor example, if you are using Chrome and want to install an extension not from the Web Store, the following code entered in a terminal starts Chrome in a \"permissive\" mode for this instance:  \ngoogle-chrome --easy-off-store-extension-install  \n\nExplanation for the switch:  \n\nEnables extensions to be easily installed from sites other than the web store. Without this\n  flag, they can still be installed, but must be manually dragged onto chrome://extensions/.  \n\nSource: http://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/\nThe usual caveats apply. The user should be careful about installing extensions. Commmand line switches come and go and need not work with earlier versions or future versions of the browser.  \nI can't answer about Chromium because I don't use it. \n", "Q: Burned DVD essentially has no content and the DVD is not bootable when creating on Mac OSX I have been unsuccessful when burning downloaded ISOs to a DVD on OSX - the burned DVD essentially has no content and the DVD is not bootable.

I reserved a 120Gb NTFS primary partition for Ubuntu, and installed the 64bit version of Ubuntu 12.04. In windows 7 I can see the Ubuntu folder and about 113Gb free on the reserved partition.\nI wonder what kind of risks am I running to if I override the set limit.\n\nA: There are many cases of Wubi virtual disk corruption. The exact cause is unclear to me although I suspect in many cases it's the forced shutdown/reboot of the Wubi Ubuntu install. There are some cases where the affected users insist that they did not force shutdown so, the truth is - I don't know exactly. But what I do know is that my blog page to correct this problem is the most visited page by far, so it does affect many people.\nThat's why I recommend that if you need to store data you should do it on the /host partition (NTFS) as separate files, rather than all stored together in the virtual disk (that is really just one file). It's simply a question of risk, whether that file is deleted by accident or corruption, you have all your eggs in one basket.\nWhat I also recommend is synchronize the data you do keep on the Wubi install to Ubuntu One. So in that way you can have the convenience of Wubi without the risk.\nThe 32GB limit on the script (which I maintain) is based on the 30GB limit built into Wubi. I have no specific reason or knowledge that anything over this will be more susceptible to corruption (and personally I doubt that it makes any difference), but I don't believe people should be encouraged to create 100GB virtual disks because of the risk. That's the reason.\nI've written about this on my blog which I encourage you to read if you have more questions: \nhttp://ubuntu-with-wubi.blogspot.ca/2011/08/missing-rootdisk.html\nhttp://ubuntu-with-wubi.blogspot.ca/2012/07/whats-wrong-with-wubiubuntu.html\nhttp://ubuntu-with-wubi.blogspot.ca/2012/08/six-wubi-rules.html\n", "Q: How to create an Internet connection using cable in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS?

Can anyone give a detailed procedure of how to do it. Ubuntu and windows partion are primary, NTFS partitions. My ram is 8gb.\n\nA: It sounds like you created the partition already, but it is NTFS?\nI think I would run \"gparted\" from the installation CD/USB, as it will graphically display your disk layout, and allow you to change it.  You will need to choose \"sda\" from the drop-down list on the right, which would default to the current disk, the CD or USB stick.\nOnce you have the hard disk displayed, find the Ubuntu partition, and click on it.  It should highlight that partition in the list below; note the name in the first column, which will be something like \"/dev/sda2\", or possibly a higher number.  This is the Linux method of specifying disks, because the filesystem is mounted to a directory in \"/dev\".\nYou then right-click on that entry in the list, and choose \"format to\", then choose \"ext4\".  To actually apply this operation, you will click on the green checkmark to the right of the icons in the toolbar, or use the menu \"Edit -> apply\".  This step may not be required, but I'm not sure if you can re-format during the install.\nYou also need a small swap drive, probably about 5 GB or so.  I'd resize the last partition to reduce it by that much, to create a blank partition at the end of the drive.  You can also delete the Ubuntu partition, then create a new partition that is 5 GB smaller, and create another after it formatted as swap.\nOnce this is done, click on the icon on the desktop to install Ubuntu, and when you get to the disk partitioning section, choose \"Something Else\" for Manual Partitioning.  Then choose the partition you formatted.  The questions are fairly straight-forward, except perhaps the one that says \"Use As\", where you enter or select from the lis \"/\" for the main filesystem, and for the swap drive, you can select \"swap\" from the list.\nI'm probably a bit vague because I don't remember the exact wording.  This part is close to the start of the install, so if you get stuck, you can always stop and ask questions.\n", "Q: Note book is getting very hot when using Ubuntu 12.04 I have bought a Toshiba satellite Pro L850 note book.

What worked for me was this:\nOpen a terminal and run:\n$gksu gedit /etc/default/grub\n\nfind the line:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"\nand add the command \"acpi_osi=\" after \"quiet splash\" \nso the line will end up looking like this:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_osi=\"\nafter words, in the terminal again:\n$sudo update-grub\n\nand restart your computer.\nThis left the brightness keys of my laptop not working, but the fan now comes on and off as it should and the computer doesn't overheat.\nThis may or may not be a solution that works with your computer, but it may be worth a try if you are still struggling.\n\nA: This is only for beginners...\nI have a dual boot in my Laptop (windows 8 and ubuntu 12.04). After updating I found that I am facing a overheating problem in Ubuntu.\nI think this is a problem is caused by the GPU. I have an ATI redon GPU. A software named xdiagnose is responsible for overheating, I think. Because after removing it my overheating problem is solved.\nFollow this process and remove the xdiagnose software. Then restart...\n\n\n*\n\n*go to software centre\n\n*Select installed from the top\n\n*then select 1st one ( accessories )\n\n*find xdiagnose and remove it\nI know this is not best solution... but it helped me ...\n", "Q: Error when Using ffmpeg I'm trying to create a video file from a series of JPGs using the following command:-\nffmpeg -f image2 -i img*.jpg -s 640x480 movie.mpg\n\nbut it fails after generating a lot of output with the following:-\n<lots of output, removed>\nStream #0.0 -> #89.0\nStream #0.0 -> #90.0\nStream #0.0 -> #91.0\nStream #0.0 -> #92.0\nPress [q] to stop encoding\n[mjpeg @ 0x95dfac0]get_buffer() failed (-1 0 0 (nil))\nVideo encoding failed\n\nWhat's causing the error and how can I fix it?\n\nA: Glob syntax (*) won't work for image sequences. You must use %d for indicating where to look for the number (assuming that your image sequence is numbered, otherwise it will not work).\nAlso you might specify an output framerate with -r\nffmpeg -f image2 -i img%d.jpg -r 25 -s 640x480 movie.mpg\n\nThis takes the images img0.jpg, img1.jpg, img2.jpg... and creates a video with 25 frames per second.\n", "Q: Which Compression Format will give the least size Hi i have a few GBs of files which i am supposed to burn to a DVD for permanent storage, which compression format will give me \"LEAST\" size, thanks\n\nA: I just did a test with the supported formats on File Roller (the default archive manager, ak. Archive Manager) and this result is based on the selected .pdf and as you can see it's sorted by Size:\nAs you can see the Compression Format that won it was: .xz\n\n\nA: There is no single most efficient format. They use different algorithms and the efficiency depends on the data you want to compress. Some data \"suits\" some algorithms better than other. There is no easier way to find out which results in the smallest file than trying.\nIn my experience 7z and rar give good results. Zip tends to be a little bigger. No experience with other formats though. Hope this helps a little.\nEDIT\nA little addition: There are file formats that are already compressed, like most audio, video or picture files. If you compress those you don't save very much space. In some case (mostly small jpg or mp3 files, but can also happen big video files) the compressed archive can even be bigger than the file.\n", "Q: do-release-upgrade hangs at downloading openjdk-6-jre-headless I'm trying to do do-release-upgrade (also tried the graphical version before - same issue with less details).\nIt always get stuck downloading openjdk-6-jre-headless.

This file is about 26 MB (again different?).\nWhy is this? What's the problem? How can I fix it? Or work around it?\nThere are some similar questions, e.g. here orhere. The suggestions cannot really be applied for do-release-upgrade, though (or at least I don't know how).\n\nA: I'm not sure if this can count as an answer but I post it anyway because this is how I solved it now:\nIt seemed that it already modified my sources.conf with the precise (the latest Ubuntu) release. So I just tried with both apt-get upgrade and apt-get dist-upgrade. Initially, I got similar problems with openjdk-6-jre-headless but with some back and forth (I think mostly because of apt-get distupgrade), this somehow resolved. However, this also didn't finished completely and I got a very much messed up system.\nSome follow up questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Could not perform immediate configuration on 'util-linux'\n\n*packages been kept back\n\n*trying to overwrite ... which is also in package ...\nAfter I got this all resolved, I tried the do-release-upgrade again and it seems to work now.\n", "Q: Switchable graphics in Ubuntu Windows in my Acer laptop had a function that made the graphics switch to a lower quality (or something) whenever I didn't have the charger plugged in.\nNow that I'm using Ubuntu, it doesn't seem to work the same way because my computer is practically eating battery power. I guess this has something to do with the drivers which I heard is a bit of a problem in all Linux systems.\nCan this be solved simply?\nI know many people have asked the same question and it looks like it's solvable. Because I don't really understand the answers to similar questions, is there someone that could explain how to do it in a more pedagogic way?\n\nA: AMD switchable graphics is now available in Ubuntu as well but it doesn't support automatic switching. You have to manually select the GPU that you wish to use.\nTo enable it eneter this command in the terminal,\nsudo apt-get install fglrx\n\nAfter the drivers have installed, restart your computer. Once it has restarted,\nsudo aticonfig --initial\n\nand restart again.\nOnce it has restarted again, Run AMD Catalyst Control Centre (Admin mode) from the dash and head to switchable graphics section.

I'm trying to properly install Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS 64-bit PC (AMD64) with the alternate install CD \".iso\" on a lenovo Thinkpad X220.\nDefault Hard Disk (with a pre-installed version of Windows 7) has been replaced with a brand new SSD.\nThe UEFI BIOS of the lenovo Thinkpad X220 is set to \"UEFI Boot only\" & \"USB UEFI BIOS Support\" is enabled (I'm using an external USB DVD reader to perform Ubuntu installation).\nThe BIOS is a Phoenix SecureCore Tiano, BIOS version is 8DET56WW (1.26).

If it booted in BIOS mode, it would try to install grub-pc (for BIOS-based systems), which wouldn't work if your firmware is set to boot the hard disk in EFI mode. I doubt if this is the problem, but I thought I'd toss it out as a possibility. You can check your boot mode by dropping to a shell and looking for the /sys/firmware/efi file; if it's present, you've booted in EFI mode. If not, you've probably booted in BIOS mode, although that's not 100% certain.\nIn any event, at this point your best bet is to do a manual installation of an EFI boot loader. IMHO, GRUB 2 (which is Ubuntu's default) is the worst possible choice; it's flaky and unreliable on EFI systems, in my experience. The easiest to get working is likely to be either ELILO or Fedora's patched GRUB Legacy. If you want to use a 3.3.0 or later kernel, it includes its own built-in EFI boot loader, which is quite reliable and can be very easy to use if paired with rEFInd. My Web page on EFI boot loaders describes all the options and includes installation instructions. Detailing them all here would be impractical.\n\nA: i would say to consult the arch wiki here:\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB2\n for getting your grub installed. then post back to let me know how you got to your OS.:) i'm trying to setup the same exact thing you are but my grub tries to boot to the lvm root instead of the luks container. if i tell grub to look for the luks container, it does, i enter the passphrase and then it doesn't know where to look for the lvm root!\n\nA: I don't know if it applies to 12.04, but on 14.04 I needed to boot up Ubuntu live and install grub-efi before running the ubiquity installer.

This resulted in only booting to Windows XP with no access to Ubuntu. I had to download a disk partitioning program to undo all of this. A tip from the Internet said to create a partition on the C drive for Ubuntu, so I did along with a Swap Partition. I did this manually because the installer on the CD would not do so and would not let me do so from within the installer program. \nWith the fresh partitions created for Ubuntu I let the installer do its thing. The computer rebooted and came up in Ubuntu. I then installed WINE and all was well. Then I shut the computer down for the night. \nThe next day I turned on the computer and it booted directly into Ubuntu. I can see the Windows partition and all the files but it will not allow me to switch to the Windows XP OS. Does not even give me a choice to do so. I have reinstalled Ubuntu several times and each time is the same, I cannot access Windows XP anymore. \nRight now I am in a fresh install with only whatever the installer installed. How do I fix this?! I have tried the hold the shift key to see if something called GRUB shows up, but no. I tried shifting the order of boot in GRUB but that did not work either. I tried using EasyBCD but that will not run. \nOne symptom I do not understand, my monitor will post a graphic when the computer reboots that the cable is disconnected, this is normal. Then when the computer gets to the actual boot process it will display the splash screens etc and it did this for Windows XP as well. But now something new has popped up, while booting Ubuntu after where it probably should be showing me a menu to pick what OS I want to boot, the monitor posts \"Input Unsupported\" until Ubuntu loads. I have never seen it post this before, maybe a clue to someone. \n\nA: Hm, it could be a problem with Grub's GFX mode. You could enable textmode for the boot menu:\nOpen the terminal and edit the file /etc/default/grub.cfg e.g. with nano:\nsudo nano /etc/default/grub\n\nAnd remove the # from the line\n#GRUB_TERMINAL=console\n\nso that it becomes \nGRUB_TERMINAL=console\n\nSave & exit.

When you uninstall wubi via the Add/Remove Program feature of Windows, you are effectively just removing this/these file(s).\nNothing in Windows itself will be removed or lost - just the Ubuntu changes.\nBest advice is to backup any important files to external media such as CD/DVD or USB.

I just tried it with a different one and it worked fine.\n\nA: The errors are pretty self explanatory for what i can see, the first one needs a real mount point, meaning that if you are mounting a filesystem under a folder that does not exist you simply can't; the second one is saying that your filesystem is already mounted, just analyze the output of cat /etc/mtab and see if it's true, probably you will find your filesystem already mounted.\n\nA: In the first instance, the directory that you are trying to mount the device to does not exist.  Even though you will read that directories are actually \"files\" in the Linux filesystem, for the purposes of mounting the mount point must be a directory.  A general mount point that is always available on a Linux filesystem is /mnt so the command \nsudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt\n\nwill always mount the first partition on the first hard drive at /mnt\nThe second error is telling you that the filesystem is already mounted at the mount point you have given it, either with a previous mount command, or by you trying to access it through Nautilus (for example).\n", "Q: Lyrics on mp3 ID-tag Since a few years ago I stopped listening to CDs and began to listen to mp3 only.

My router is doing 'Mode B/G/N Mixed'.\n\nA: It's possible your signal quality is too low to support 11n communications.  11g has less throughput but more reliability than 11n.  If you were really far out of range, your machine would switch to 11b.  I have had machines that do this and I love it.

The unresponsive script window is persistent now.\n\nA: Generally unresponsive scripts are caused due to buggy add-ons, or when add-ons are being used in an unintended manner.\nThe most common solution is to disable all of your add-ons and enable them one by one with intervals of usage until you find out the one causing the issue.\n\nA: For Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Firefox 37.0.2 this is my way of fixing this.\nFrom tools menu, select addons and then, on addons page, select extensions\nDisable all extensions and verify that the problem does not occur anymore.\nRe-enable one extension at a time and detect the one that causes the problem.\n", "Q: Monday as first day in GNOME Shell (instead of Sunday) I've been dealing with different regional settings (US, Canada and other locations in English, as well as other countries and languages), but I cannot get GNOME Shell Calendar to begin with Monday, instead of Sunday.

My primary goal is to learn Linux and Apache/PHP development. I need to keep my Windows OS as main on my machine for work, so I'm trying to virtualize Ubuntu 12.4.1 without luck (many attempts). I have a new HP Envy 4t-1000 with 16GB RAM, and 32 GB SSD caching with 500gb spindle hard drive. Graphics card is an Intel HD 3000 with AMD Radeon 7670M. \nWith installing Ubuntu desktop in VBox, I'm getting this result:\nUbuntu installs failing. Suspect hybrid SSD/spindle drive\nWith VMware workstation 7 (patched), I complete the install of Ubuntu, it reboots, purple desktop briefly flashes then it drops to command line. I bought a beginning Ubuntu book, and it recommends trying to manually configure graphics if this happens. So I tried doing a safe boot holding shift -  I get to the first screen (GRUB) loads fine, and I choose recovery mode. After choosing the recovery mode, I get the recovery mode options, and can arrow down to what the book suggests 'Run in fail safe graphic mode.'  Once I select this option, I get a black screen with a large white dialogue box, at the top it says \"The system is running in low-graphics mode.  Your screen, graphics card, and input device settings could not be detected correctly. You will need to configure these yourself.\"  Then there is an OK button way down at the bottom.

Rebooting at this point just goes back to command line as before.\nI don't know what to do at this point, I've spent too many hours this weekend trying in both VBox and VMware to get Ubuntu going.  Isn't there like a very basic graphic display or something I can use to at least get into the desktop?\nI explored the GRUB some more, and tried to look at the startup and xserver logs - both are blank. No help there I guess?  When I try to choose 'Edit the configuration file, then 'OK' screen just refreshes on same menu options, nothing happens.\nThanks for any advice.

If not, what is the cause, if it is how can I disable it?\n\nA: Firstly, --dport localhost doesn't seem right; 'localhost' is an address, not a port specifier.\nHowever, delays during iptables output are generally due to address resolution. iptables is trying to query the name for the IP address that it prints out, and this may take some time, especially where there's no match.

And, is there a way to show similar commands, including those that aren't yet installed, instead of running the application, ftp for example?\n\nA: Bash uses the command /usr/lib/command-not-found for looking similar commands. This in turn uses Python's CommandNotFound module. \nThe output you see on the terminal(stderr in this case), is also generated from this module. The location of this module is /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/CommandNotFound/CommandNotFound.py, on Ubuntu 14.04 and up. There is a default limit set on number of similar commands in the function CommandNotFound.print_spelling_suggestion(self, word, min_len=3, max_len=15) on line 138. You can modify the max_len value to say 30 (Use sudo nano or gksudo gedit to edit this file).\n\nA: It's quite likely that the 23 \"similar\" commands would not be much more use to you than 'goo', 'god', and 'gord'.  The little trick most bash'ers use to find things is to use the man pages since the search is content based rather than just by name.  For example, try\nman -k ftp\n\nIf you find a likely or insteresting command look at the man page itself by dropping the -k switch:\nman sftp\n\nman has it's own manual page:\nman man\n\nNow you know why, whenever you install a new program or application it very often installs a man page for you as well.\nOh yes, to search in or for man pages you haven't installed yet you might like one of the many online man sites such as this one.\n", "Q: How to solve \"Controller 'IDE Controller' does not support hotpluggin\"?

If there is one of the partitions that is not required then you can delete it and let Ubuiquity make its extended partition.  (you can then have many more partitions inside the extended partition).\nWe need to know what the partitions are currently being used for so that we can advise you on which is the best way to go.  Presumably Win7 is your main partition, however it may just be a Microsoft bootloader.  The recovery partition is the Windows recovery, which can be used to re-install Windows from scratch if you have to.  It's probably a good idea to make the boot DVD's as well, rather than just relying on the recovery partition.  HP_tools and System could be anything - but System could be your real Windows partition.  \nIf system partition is indeed the largest and contains the real Windows system, I think I would backup the data on it and delete it.  You could then use that space for an extended partition which could contain Windows and the Ubuntu root and swap partitions.  Backing up your data at this point would be a very good idea, as is making the Windows install disks - there will be a HP Utility for doing so.  After you make the Windows boot disk, make quite sure there are no errors and that you can boot off it.\nSo that we can help you further, please boot of the Ubuntu LiveCD or LiveUSB and select \"try Ubuntu\".  Next open a terminal windows with ctrlaltt and type \nsudo fdisk -l\n\nand past the results from it into your question.\nThanks, that gives us some idea.  It looks like:\nsda1 hpfs   407551     194MB  208MiB\nsda2 hpfs   946182143  451GB  484445MiB\nsda3 hpfs   29968383   14GB   15343MiB\nsda4FAT32   210991     100Mb  108MiB\n\nIt seems that the main partition is /dev/sda2, 450Gb\nAfter backing up and making sure that you have made the Windows installation disks correctly, you could try deleting /dev/sda2 and make and extended partition in its place. You can then make three partitions inside the extended partition: Windows partition, ext4 Linux partition, and a Linux swap partition at least equal to your RAM size.\nThe problem may be that Windows won't install to a logical partition easily, however a google search finds instructions for this so it should be possible to do so.  This might be a little complicated for the Windows installation, so there are a few alternatives:\nA Wubi install of Ubuntu uses a Virtual Ubuntu boot disk inside of Windows.  It's a good way of using Ubuntu without changing your Windows or the partitions at all. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide\nAn alternative would be to remove the Windows Bootloader on /dev/sda1 as well since installing Ubuntu will also install the grub bootloader, so it is really redundant.  The procedure would be as follows:\n\n\n*\n\n*Backup all important data in the Windows installation and make sure that you can access recovery options for Windows such as the OEM installation partition\n\n*On the Windows main partition run chkdsk and defrag the drive\n\n*Delete the Windows bootloader partition\n\n*Resize the main Windows partition to make room for the extended partition - size is up to you (maybe 50/50?)\n\n*Create the extended partition in the space left by resizing Windows.\n\n*Create two partitions inside the extended partition: 1 swap partition of at least the size of your RAM, and the rest as and ext4 partition for Windows.\n\n*Install Ubuntu in the new ext4 partition.  After install both Ubuntu and Windows should be accessible.\n\n", "Q: Falied installing ATI X.Org binary driver!!

My normal monitor was a 1080p Soniview TV that supports 1920x1080. I use 1680x1050 (16:10) as my common resolution. My amazed is when I see that the launcher icons looks more to a \"correct size\" of 32px to what they show in my Soniview where they actually take about 50% more using the same resolution. They are both the same resolution but in the Soniview the launcher icons look 50% bigger than the ones in the Samsung.\nMy question is then, why the difference between both monitors since they are using the same resolution but are showing different launcher icon sizes.\n\nA: It's probably a difference in PPI (pixels per inch) between the monitors.  There's something going on between the EDID PPI, the actual PPI, and possibly a resolution translation with your other monitor.  For example if you have to change screen dynamics to make the display fit the whole screen, it might get shrunk or stretched to do so.  \nYou would have to compare both screens running in their native resolutions, and take into account the real PPI: Doing so would probably more closely give the results that you expect to see.\n", "Q: How do I change the resolution on an Asus 101mt?

It generally defaults to about 1GB.  You can increase the size of the persistence file with a bit of fiddling, however since the LiveUSB has to boot off a FAT32 partition the size of the persistence file will still be limited to 4Gb - The maximum file size under FAT32.\nI suggest what you should do given your current situation, is to make a full install to the 16Gb pendrive.  This will boot quite a bit slower than the LiveCD, but has the advantage that it is a full install and can be updated and added to up to the limit of the 16Gb which will be available under ext4.\nFind a smaller USB stick to put the LiveUSB on and use that to install Ubuntu to the 16Gb stick as a full install.  If you want speed and functionality at the expense of sophistication, you could try Lubuntu instead of Ubuntu.  This is much more lightweight and will boot faster and be a little more snappy than Ubuntu with Unity while running off a USB stick.\nBe quite certain that you are installing grub2 to the 16GB stick.  A common problem when installing in this mode is that Ubiquity will default to the first device it finds to put the grub bootloader on.  If this happens to be the wrong device, then the 16GB stick will not have the bootloader installed and you will have to do some work to fix it.\n", "Q: MacBook install: no mountable file systems I own a MacBook Pro running Mountain Lion.

Apparently Firestarter is no longer maintained, and it does not have any options in its interface for handling the connection to a VPN. Right now, my VPN does not work if my Firewall is activated.\nI would like to find an alternative GUI firewall manager that will let me make configurations to accomodate my VPN service. Which should I use, and what considerations should I take into account when migrating from Firestarter?\nI did a Google search, and tried to restrict results within the last year, but it seems people are still recommending Firestarter, despite it not being maintained.\nWith almost near certainty, someone will probably suggest that I just manage my \"iptables\" from the command line. Please understand that I am not interested in a command line interface for managing my firewall. Thanks.\n\nA: First of all, the main reason behind Firestarter not being maintained any more is that Ubuntu comes in with the firewall called ufw by default. You can install a graphical interface to ufw by selecting it from the Ubuntu Software Center (package gufw) or by typing\nsudo apt-get install gufw\n\nPlease note that any and every \"firewall\" in Ubuntu will be some kind of interface to the iptables. Some of these interfaces are graphical (like Firestarter), some not (like ufw), some are not graphical, but come with their own graphical interface. You will find more information on this page.\nAlso, please consider the following. Firewall can be of real use if you do understand iptables and the way TCP/IP works. If you do, then configuring the firewall using either naked iptables or some kind of text interface based on config files (like ufw) usually presents no problem.\n", "Q: I need help with Grub and restoring Windows? I started out with Windows XP and then I installed Zorin (a sub distro of Ubuntu) and then I installed Ubuntu. This was working great. Then I installed Windows 8 on yet another partition and couldn't get into my other OSs. \nI asked my tech teacher at school how to fix it and she said just clear the partition that I installed Windows 8 on, so I booted onto a live version of Ubuntu and cleared the Windows 8 partition. Okay then I rebooted and it still went into Windows 8 for some reason. \nSo I got back onto live Ubuntu and it turns out Windows 8 partition didn't clear for some reason so I did it again (and I'm positive it was the Windows 8 partition). I still couldn't fix grub but I needed something out of my XP partition so I mounted it on the live Ubuntu and now all the XP partition have are the folders 'Boot', 'Recovery', 'System Volume Information', 'temp' and the files 'bootmgr', 'BOOTNXT', 'BOOTSECT.BAK' and 'Recovery.txt'.\nAnybody know how to fix this or what I did wrong? Also, if I try booting from my hard drive it shows the Windows and says 'preparing automatic repair' then 'Diagnosing your PC' then restarts.

In this case that is Windows 8, and from experience, wiping out the partition does not remove the bootloader.  \nTo fix this problem, before you go the nuke everything and rebuild phase maybe you can try EasyBCD and create a custom bootloader. It should work fine and should be able to read all the OSes you have currently.

You can try a software like TestDisk or any other similar data recovery softwares to try and Undelete the files you need from your XP partition\n\nA: the problem with windows is it overrides MBR (master boot record) and hence when you installed W8 it just wipes out everything in there. so you are not able to view your any other installations.\nas suggested above you have to install all windows first .. and older version foremost then go on with ubuntu. if you have some data to recover use live-CD / USB to take backup.\nhope that helps.\n\nA: What you need to do is to restore Grub which the Windows 8 installation removed.\nYou'll need an Ubuntu liveCD or liveUSB.\nBoot from your liveCD/USB.\nIdentify your disk by typing in a terminal: ls -l /dev/disk/by-label/ (for example sda, or sdb)\nThen run sudo grub-install /dev/XXX where XXX is the drive name.\nsource: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows\n\nA: Suggesstion...\nJust format your entire hard disk and install the set of OSs again.

(Partitioning from live cd or from windows, windows installation, ubuntu installation, and possible additional steps).\n\n\nThanks in advance\n\nA: I don't recall offhand if Windows really requires anything beyond its C: partition and the ESP on an EFI installation. If it does, the installer will probably create whatever it needs automatically. My own approach would probably be to just leave free space for Windows and let the Windows installer create whatever it needs.\nThere is one major caveat: In my experience, the Windows 7 installer is very fussy about the ESP; it requires a FAT32 ESP. If you've got a FAT16 ESP, as many Linux installers create, Windows will flake out. IIRC, it'll either create a second ESP and become confused after one of its reboots during the installation or it will report that there's no ESP and refuse to install at all. Fortunately, you can change from a FAT16 to a FAT32 ESP by backing up, unmounting the ESP, using mkdosfs, remounting the ESP, and restoring the files. You may also need to adjust the /etc/fstab file if it uses the \"UUID\" (really a serial number) to identify the ESP.\nAs on a BIOS system, there's a possibility of boot loader issues after any OS installation. Thus, keeping a backup of the ESP is wise, and being prepared to deal with problems (via an emergency boot disc or the like) is also wise.\n\nA: Some BIOS have difficulties to find boot files located too far from the start of the disk, so i would:\n\n\n*\n\n*via Gparted reduce the sda2 partition from 83GB to 20GB\n\n*install Windows in the 63GB free space\n\n*Use Boot-Repair Recommended Repair to add a valid Windows UEFI entry in the GRUB menu\n\n\nThis would give something like:\nsda      465.8G  disk \n├─sda1   190.8M  part /boot/efi\n├─sda2      20G  part /\n└─sda3    63.8G  part /windows\n├─sda4   300.0G  part /home\n└─sda5     1.9G  part [SWAP]\n\n\nA: On my Windows 7 hard disk, win7 ignored the EFI fat32 system partition, and made a new 100MB partition in unallocated space at the very end of the disk. To prevent this windows should be installed on a fully partitioned disk, without unallocated space.\nI understand that windows wants to be the first OS at the start of the disk, but I have no personal experience to back this up.\n", "Q: How to resolve \"Network host is busy; will retry in 30 seconds\"? I have added a network printer, a Konica Minolta C253, via cups by its IP (http://10.0.0.42) under the http://localhost:631/ cups webfrontend on an Ubuntu 11.10 client.\nI used the documented KOC353U.ppd in the process.\nI was able to print exactly one page.\nAfterwards, all I get in the printer's status is the message: \"Network host '10.0.0.42' is busy; will retry in 30 seconds\".\nWhat is the problem here and how do I resolve it?\n\nA: don't use ipp.\nuse \"socket://###.###.###.##:port#/\" for your  printer instead.\nport # maybe 9100 or 631\nReason: The first specifications of IPP lacked of some important details. This allowed Microsoft to implement it in a their own way. The result was that printer manufacturer had to decide how to do their IPP support the way Microsoft does.\nTherefore you should use a different protocol, the socket protocol.\n\nA: I solved it by switching to the lpd protocol. Socket lead to a broken pipe problem.\nSo I changed the connection to:\nlpd://10.0.0.42/queue\n", "Q: Audio players that access music library as file browser (and see folder structure) I have a big music library. Nothing special there.\nBut I very much dislike the way usually music library is displayed in most recommended players, according to Artist/Album/Year/Genre tags, ignoring my folder structure or making it hardly accessible.\nThe problem is that not all my music is tagged according to genre etc, but all  is perfectly ordered by folder structure  which takes into account all characteristics handled by tags, as well as many others, which I can change and specify at any time. (I can decide ordering my music by country, inside a sub-category like \"baroque music\", for example).  \nThe advantage of using folder-structure-display of medialibrary is that all the logical structure is displayed, with all sub-categories, which can be sub-detailed, varied, and changed at wish and be all visible at the same time.\nI am looking for some plugins to good players that would provide a solution to this, and I am looking for different solutions to this.\nTherefore I'll display as my own answer some solutions that I have already found and welcome other answers with new and better ways to achieve the same purpose. \n(Most welcome are of course players that, beside having the capability discussed here, would not lack other elementary features like playlists in tabs, search, and the like.) \n\nA: guayadeque \nWe made best experience with guayadeque. We can easily switch between library (tag) view and folder view (see also the nice online manual)\n\n\nFor Lubuntu see this screenshot: Guayadeque - Lubuntu 12.10\n\nA: Try Exaile:\n\n\nYou can update it from a ppa:\n sudo apt-add-repository ppa:exaile-devel/ppa\n sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install exaile\n\nSee: Exaile music player lives on, version 3.3.0 released with many improvements [Ubuntu ppa]\n\nA: I was in a similar situation some years ago but eventually embraced the tagging paradigm, and never looked back.\nI still keep the music in genre and (optionally) sub- and sub-sub-genre folders, but all querying and organisation is done by tags. With a sufficiently powerful searching capability, all my use-cases are solved, and I can now manipulate the library in far more ways than folders alone. Admittedly, though, viewing the hierarchy is much less pretty.\nAs it happens I use (and now co-develop) Quod Libet for this;  directory-based genres can be queried by: ~dirname=/Baroque\\/German/ (or whatever) or you could define a sub-genre tag (and automate).  More recently, there's also a Filter On Directory plugin - might help some simple use-cases. However, if you have a solid idea for a new type of browser, feel free to raise a feature request...\n\nA: The music player quite similar to foobar in terms of its simplicity and ease of use is probably decibel, which you can install it with \nsudo apt-get install decibel-audio-player\n\nInstead of importing all your music, you can navigate the folder structure in the side pain and then drag and drop the selected folder into the main pain and start playing your music straightaway (see the first screenshot). Decibel is designed to provide a very simple and convenient method of retaining the folder structure of your music and it allows you to find what you want very quickly and easily. \nIt may not be the most feature-rich of media players, and may not have everything that you desire, but I find it to be an excellent player. More information is available at the decibel homepage.  \n\nIf you have any problems in navigating your folders, check that your home folder is listed in decibel's explorer by going to preferences > explorer and clicking file explorer (see screenshot 2 and 3 below) and adding it if necessary (see screenshot 3).\n\n \n\nA: First, an example is Foobar2000 in Wine. Foobar2000 has different ways of displaying media library, my favorites being Album list (foo_albumlist,  component installed by default) and especially Facets (foo_facets, component to be manually installed). I am aware that finding something better than Foobar2000 is unlikely. The downside of Foobar is of course using Wine.\n\nDeadBeef has a plugin called File Browser that displays the media library as folder structure. You need to select the path to the library: Edit-Preferences-Plugins-File browser-Configure. Only one such path can be set, which is a limitation.\n\nDeadbeef player has playlist tabs but no library search (as far as I know).\n\nClementine is an excellent player. You just have to select \"Files\" instead of \"Library\". The player has playlist tabs.\n\nsudo apt-get install clementine\n\nQmmp, mostly known fot its winamp-like GUI, has plugins (qmmp-plugin-pack) and one of them can activate a GUI which has the features demanded here.\n\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:forkotov02/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install qmmp qmmp-plugin-pack\n\n\nAmarok. Just like in Clementine, file browsing is available by selection on a left pane. \n\nThereon, it operates much the same way, except there are no tabbed playlists. These are accessible from a separate left-pane, Playlists > Saved playlists; they cannot be created from within the file browser. To create one, the easy way is to create a current playlist, go to Playlists as indicated (Playlists > Saved playlists), select the current playlist content and dra&drop it among the saved playlists.\n\n\nYarok can also access folders as intended here. No real tab playlists,but playlists are easy to create and access. \n\n\nsudo apt-get install yarok\n\nQuod Libet. Choose View - File System, then select one or multiple media library folders (Music-Preferences-Library);these folders are then displayed along the /home folder and mounted partitions and external drives. They can be browsed, but  there is no context menu nor drag-and-drop for folders: to get files into the current playlist one has to browse down to the audio files. Only then, these can be selected and added to a dedicated playlist. Access to playlists is by going again to View-Playlists; there is no common/parallel display of File browser and playlists, and playlists content is accessible only when selected (no parallel playlists like in tabs)\n\n\nFor KDE - Kaffeine - the KDE media player. I was pleasantly surprised how thoroughly this player is satisfying the demands of my question. In KDE it looks better because it is better integrated with the KDE appearance. In KDE  it seems integrated with Dolphin file manager, but it will work very well in other environments and will bring an integrated file manager feature. Without Dolphin  some secondary (Dolphin-specific) features, like preview play/view will be disabled, but the most important features are present inside the player, by just selecting the Playlist tab from the left side of the window. In this way it is easy to navigate to the music files and drag and drop them into the playlist. \n\n\nPragha can add multiple directories into the library and then accesses it by folder structure. It can display folders with or without the top level by clicking to merge folders or not.\n\n\nIt lacks multiple playlists (like Decibel, and unlike Deadbeef, Clementine, Exaile, Qmmp etc.) \n\nI have tested other players mentioned in the other answers and will try to offer feedback on them too.\nExaile  has a GUI that looks very similar to Deadbeef, Qmmp and Clementine and the general experience is similar, given the tabbed playlists.\nGuayadeque is a bit different. Its file browser is focused on the different directories added to the library, and that would not access all the system by default, but only the paths set by going to View-Preferences-Collections, and there by selecting and/or creating a collection and adding new paths. This is an advantage, as useless directories are thus not visible. Playlists are accessible by selecting My Music and then the Playlist view.\nDecibel is more similar to QuodLibet, in that it has no playlists (tabbed or otherwise). By default, its file browser has a two-option switch between displaying whole folders (\"root\") or only  Home folder, but these can be edited, folders can be added or removed as indicated in the other answer, namely here.\n\nGuayadeque, Deadbeef, QuodLibet, Decibel and Foobar2000 have a folder-view access of the music library (that is a way to select the specific target folders), not just a file browser to access any folders. \nOn the whole I tend to favor the players that have tabs for playlists and display them in the same window as the file browser, that is: Deadbeef, Clementine, Exaile, Qmmp.\n\nA: Apart from the facts that it can access the music library as file browser (and see folder structure), and that it is easy to change the music library directory (e.g. to a subfolder), I recommend Banshee above all other music players, for one simple reason:\nmetadata editing that works for all music players.\nWhile it is possible to create new playlists or compilation albums by first copying tracks to another (e.g. work-in-progress) folder (using the file manager) then importing them and editing the track information with other music players, in my experience it is only Banshee that fully updates the track metadata, file name, and folder name, so that it shows up in all other music players including personal/portable music players. (Caveat: the only exception is .wav files, which cannot be fully edited, although the edited metadata does show up in Banshee itself).\nNo other 'Linux' music player/library organiser has this ability. Edited track data in e.g. Clementine, Rhythmbox, or Quodlibet/Exfalso does not show up in any other music player.\nUnfortunately, Banshee development seems to have been abandoned since 2016, but it still works, and it is the only 'Linux' music player/library organiser that comes remotely close to itunes7 (2004?).\n", "Q: should `dist-upgrade` be followed with a reboot? Following a periodic, in my case weekly, run of:\napt-get update\napt-get dist-upgrade\nis there much benefit from rebooting?\n\nA: You only need to reboot if Ubuntu tells you to, e.g. when a new kernel got installed.  (It's even possible to circumvent those reboots via e.g. ksplice, which applies updates to the running kernel.) Otherwise there is no benefit from it. Restarting the specific application or a log out and log in often is enough to get all the benefits from updates.\n", "Q: How to run a command within a time duration per min/sec? I want to run a command/shell script say script.sh from 1AM to 2AM per minute. After observing that crontab can't work it out 'per sec' I had to go with 'per min'.\nBasically, My server.sh file takes backup of my database on server. This is done by three text files with names of tables in it, hence creating three backup archives. These backup archives are named like 'prefixYYYYmmdd', where prefix = heavy/light/weekly according to the backup type.\nNow I want to copy these particular files after they are stored on server. Suppose the backup on server took 15 min. Now I should run the copy script-client.sh on my local computer. As this copy script doesn't know the names of the files just created by server, it should run per sec/min in the interval those files are being created by server and grab that file.\nHow to use crontab per min/sec within that time interval?\n\nA: There's several approaches you could use.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get the script to loop 3600 times with a sleep 1 in the middle (= 1 hour) start it with cron at whatever time suits you.\n\n*Get the script to intelligently look for the files based on the date, then do the copy at a suitable time eg 4AM\n\n*Get the script to monitor when the files are made based on the date and any other relevent information. Do the copy as soon as the files are ready.\n\n\nNote that \"...copy script doesn't know the names of the files just created...\" just means that the script doesn't have the code yet.  You've said the files with have the current date, just work with that. eg:\n#!/bin/bash\nFILE=$(date +\"prefix%Y%m%d\")\necho \"The filename for today is \"$FILE\n\n\nA: I would use rsync for a job like that.

What are the differences between sudo, su, visudo, chroot, and gksu ?\n\nA: SU connects you as root. \nThe terminal will remain as root for the session.\nWith sudo (superuser do) you can perform operations as root while connected as a regular user.\n\nA: sudo:\nSudo (superuser do) allows a system administrator to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root while logging all commands and arguments. Sudo operates on a per-command basis.\nIt is not a replacement for the shell.\nFeatures include: the ability to restrict what commands a user may run on a per-host basis, copious logging of each command (providing a clear audit trail of who did what), a configurable timeout of the sudo command, and the ability to use the same configuration file (sudoers) on many different machines.\nsource\nvisudo\nvisudo is a command-line utility that allows editing of the /etc/sudoers file in a safe fashion. It opens /etc/sudoers, using the vi editor's interface by default (although this can be changed by setting the shell's EDITOR environment variable to a different text editor), prevents multiple simultaneous edits with locks, performs sanity checks and checks for parse errors.\nsource\nSU\nThe su command, also referred to as substitute user, super user, or switch user, allows a computer operator to change the current user account associated with the running virtual console.\nBy default, and without any other command line argument, this will elevate the current user to the superuser of the local system.\nWhen run from the command line, su asks for the target user's password, and if authenticated, grants the operator access to that account and the files and directories that account is permitted to access.\nAdditionally, one can switch to another user who is not the superuser\nsource\nroot\nroot is the user name or account that by default has access to all commands and files on a Linux or other Unix-like operating system. It is also referred to as the root account, root user and the superuser.\nThe word root also has several additional, related meanings when used as part of other terms.\nOne of these is the root directory, which is the top level directory on a system. That is, it is the directory in which all other directories, including their subdirectories, and files reside. The root directory is designated by a forward slash ( / ).\nAnother is /root (pronounced slash root), which is the root user's home directory.\nAlso it may refers to the user root which is the adminstrator of the system with full privileges.\nsource\nchroot\nA chroot  is an operation that changes the apparent root directory for the current running process and its children. for example if you chroot /mnt/chroot-test then the directory /mnt/chroot-test will be your virtual root that you could refer to by /.\nsource\nUses of chroots\nThe following are some possible uses of chroots:\n\n*\n\n*Isolating insecure and unstable applications\n\n\n*Running 32-bit applications on 64-bit systems\n\n\n*Testing new packages before installing them on the production system\n\n\n*Running older versions of applications on more modern versions of Ubuntu\n\n\n*Building new packages, allowing careful control over the dependency packages which are installed\nsource and more information about chroot\n\nA: *\n\n*chroot is a way of entering a folder and 'faking' that folder being / to anything executed inside. This lets you run executables on a non-booting Ubuntu installation by mounting it somewhere other than / and using /bin/bash(the one inside the installation) to get a terminal prompt.\n\n*sudo - Lets certain accounts authenticate to run a program as root or another user. Some programs may not need a password as defined in the sudoers file. Whether the request is allowed or not depends on the user(and group) running sudo, and the command to be run, as defined in sudoers.\n\n*su - Also a way of elevation, but has differences as it performs a full interactive logon as root(or another user), and gives a bash prompt unless specified otherwise with arguments. It uses the target user's credentials as authentication.\n\n*visudo - Edits the sudoers file. This uses a special executable that checks the syntax of the file to ensure you are not locked out of sudo due to a corrupted sudoers file. If you attempt to save an invalid configuration it will stop you, and return you to the editor to fix it.\n\n*gksudo or gksu is the same as sudo except it is graphical and rewrites some paths so that graphical programs do not cause permission issues on the user's profile, especially with ~/.Xauthority.\n", "Q: Is there a Ubuntu for SPARC computer? Is there a Ubuntu for SPARC computer? My friend like Ubuntu and he want to install on his SPARC (UltraSPARC IV, release 2005). \n\nA: Kind of, Yes.  There were SPARC ports of two LTS releases: 8.04 and 10.04 server.  After 10.04 however no-one was actively maintaining the ports so that was the last one.  12.04 does not have a SPARC port, and I haven't heard of anyone working on the port.\nTheoretically 10.04 server is supported until April 2015, however since no-one appears to be maintaining the SPARC ports it seems unlikely that there will be any updates.  What there is of 10.04 for SPARC is here.  Scroll down to the bottom for most of the SPARC downloads\nIt seems unlikely that there would be many people here who have used the SPARC port, but you might ask around the SPARC community to get their thoughts on it.\n\nA: No, at least -- not a recent release. You can still install 10.04 LTS, which has SPARC installation images available.\nAlternatively, you can try Debian, since Debian is continuously being released for SPARC as well as a broad range of other architectures.\n\nA: I guess the best way is to install Ubuntu 10.04, and add Debian repos, then update via those, that would keep things modern, but in effect may remove some things Ubuntu is known for ie branding, design quirks for Debian layouts ie the way gnome is layed out etc...\n", "Q: Connecting to internet after clean install of ubuntu server 12.04 I've installed ubuntu server on my computer.

It used to be that Ctrl + - and Ctrl + + would increase or decrease the text size of the terminal in earlier versions of Ubuntu, which is helpful when you're giving presentations and want to show your code in a larger size. I switched to Xubuntu 12.04, and I'm missing these keyboard shortcuts.\nIs there an alternative I can use? Or if not, is there a way I can define my own shortcut to replace these?\nUpdate: Happy to report that this question is now moot for recent versions of xfce4-terminal!

I didn't go further than making short commands that I can type quickly, so I don't have a clue how I'd be able to configure these scripts to respond ONLY when I'm inside of xfce4-terminal -- meaning that I gave up thinking about how to get the keybindings made for Ctrl+- and Ctrl++ because I currently only know about global keyboard bindings and didn't want to override those Keypress Combos since other applications will need them (ex: web browser, text editor).\nI also thought about having \"zoommin\" and \"zoommax\", to jump to my smallest and biggest fonts when needed, typically when I need to see tons of text VS when I need to show a colleague something on my screen.

XFCE, which is the main environment in Xubuntu, has its own terminal implementation. However, as far as I can tell, it is not possible in xfce4-terminal to change the font size with a shortcut (you can see the list of possible shortcuts when you go to Edit->Preferences->Shortcuts).\nIf you rely on this feature, you can install gnome-terminal, but since the whole point of using XFCE is often that it does not involve the somewhat heavy Gnome libraries, this might be a little unproductive.\n\nA: While the rest of the answers here require you to create some type of 'hack' using custom scripts, which may or may not break when doing upgrades to your system, the actual/other answer was found in a StackOverflow question here:\nCan vim zoom in and out?\nBy user: Chenming Zhang\nEdit > Preferences > Appearance\nYou will see the option: Font\nWhich contains both the chosen font and the size of the font-text.\nI know that you are looking for a 'shortcut', but all the other options seem to require lots of customization, whereas going this route will ensure that you don't screw up your Terminal with any customizations.\nThis answer is also being posted here for anybody that needs an alternate option to ctrl +- for zooming in/out.\n\nA: It is possible, though not through xfce4 proper, using this workaround:\nhttps://github.com/noah/xfce4-terminal-font\n(requires python).\nI use it in awesome window manager like this:\nawful.key({ \"Control\", \"Shift\" }, \"Up\", function () awful.util.spawn(script_dir .. \"/xfce4-terminal-font +\", false)end),\nawful.key({ \"Control\", \"Shift\" }, \"Down\", function () awful.util.spawn(script_dir .. \"/xfce4-terminal-font -\", false)end),\n\nIt's a bit of a hack, but it works.\n\nA: The following script checks if Xfce4 Terminal is running. If it is not, the script exits. This script uses arguments, script-name --in to zoom in and script-name --out to zoom out. It will work for any font type. (Different font types have a different number of words.)\nI named my script terminal-zoom, and I am using Ctrl Alt + for terminal-zoom --in and Ctrl Alt - for terminal-zoom --out.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Check if Xfce4 Terminal is running.

I am trying to find and then change the screen DPI (dots per inch) setting in 12.04 and 12.10. However, I can't seem to find any app or config file that can do this. Is there any app or conf file for this?\nNote that this is for 12.04+ so the following will not work:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I change the font DPI settings?\n\n*How to change the screen DPI in 11.10?\n\n*Is it possible to change font DPI in 11.04?\nMoreover, they are basically changing the font size, not the actual screen DPI.\n\nA: Had a similar problem, on a 2880x1620 screen.\nSee http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2106549\nSolved by putting \nxrandr --output DP-0 --scale 0.75x0.75\n\ninto my ~/.xprofile\nInstead of \"DP-0\", put whatever \nxrandr\n\ntells you as device name.\nYou can tweak the scale of course, but 0.5 somehow did not look nice on my screen.\n\nA: While the xserver-command=X -dpi ... and xrandr --dpi ... given above may have worked very well in earlier versions of Ubuntu, in Ubuntu 13.10 (which is what I have) Unity ignores those settings and keeps the dpi fixed (as far as the X server is concerned at 96 dpi).\nAnd the xrandr --scale ... command does scale the screen as described but scales it in such a way that makes text and icons a little bit blurry. But it works.\nIt appears that in Ubuntu 13.10 the best option might be not to try to change the dpi setting for the X server but instead use the unity-tweak-tool to change the default fonts used by Unity and the default font scaling factor. You can download the unity-tweak-tool from the Ubuntu Software Center. When you open the unity-tweak-tool go to the Fonts button and try changing the font scaling factor to 1.2 or 1.25 (or higher or lower) to get the fonts to appear a good size for you. On this control panel you can also change the default fonts used by Unity. Admittedly this solution doesn't scale everything on the screen, just the text, but it works really well on my laptop with its 166 dpi screen.\nIt appears web browsers like Firefox and Chromium don't notice this setting setting but each both Firefox and Chromium allow you to set a minimum font size in their application settings to scale-up the fonts on web pages in the same way.\n\nA: Install Ubuntu-Tweak http://ubuntu-tweak.com/\nOpen it and go to 'Tweaks > Fonts'.

I'm not sure how it works internally, but the effect seems to be a dpi change.\nTo scale your resolution, first find the name of your display with xrandr:\nlars:~$ xrandr\nScreen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1366 x 768, maximum 1600 x 1600\nLVDS connected 1366x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 344mm x 194mm\n   1366x768       60.0*+\n   1280x768       60.0 +\n   1280x720       60.0 +\n   1024x768       60.0 +\n   1024x600       60.0 +\n   800x600        60.0 +\n   800x480        60.0 +\n   720x480        60.0 +\n   640x480        60.0 +\nDFP1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\nCRT1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)\n\nSo, in my case my laptop display is called LVDS.\nThen run the following to scale your resolution:\nxrandr --output LVDS --scale 0.75x0.75\n\nThe Launcher and Panel might disappear for a moment, but just hover your cursor over them and they should reappear.

In 16.04 (Xenial) 3 steps are needed to set DPI correctly instead of 2.\nI'll explain on the example of the system with Ubuntu 12.04 with Gnome Classic and a monitor with resolution 1680x1050. My starting settings: xdpyinfo | grep dots reported 96x96 dots , xrdb -query | grep dpi reported Xft.dpi: 96 , grep DPI /var/log/Xorg.0.log reported some weird settings NOUVEAU(0): DPI set to (90, 88).\nIn 16.04 the outputs of all these 3 commands were consistent and were equal to 96. Though such consensus is better than the disorder of 12.04, the reported value is hardcoded and far from the real DPI value.\nLet's calculate optimal DPI for my monitor. Actual size of the screen can be found with the command xrandr | grep -w connected (convert output to centimetres) or with a long ruler by hand. In my case: X = 47.4cm ; Y = 29.6cm. Divide them by 2.54 to get the size in inches: X ~ 18.66in ; Y ~ 11.65in. Lastly divide the actual dots amount (based on your resolution) by the size in inches: X = 1680/18.66 ~ 90dpi ; Y = 1050/11.65 ~ 90dpi. So my real dpi is 90.\nBe warned, the manual method of measuring may be more accurate, than the output of the command xrandr | grep -w connected because the newer versions of X server ignore the size reported by EDID and calculate the size using the screen resolution and a hardcoded value of DPI (more info here).\nAnother method how to find the size of the monitor is to read its EDID directly. Install read-edid package and run the command sudo get-edid | parse-edid | grep DisplaySize in the terminal. Its output will give you the actual size of your monitor in millimetres. If not - use the ruler.\nLet's start fixing DPI:\n1) In 12.04 run gksudo gedit, open /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf and add a parameter under [SeatDefaults] section:\nxserver-command=X -dpi 90\n\nThere's no such file in 16.04 by default, so you must create lightdm.conf manually and put it into /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/. The contents of this file are the same:\n[SeatDefaults]\nxserver-command=X -dpi 90\n\nRestart your computer or restart X. Now grep DPI /var/log/Xorg.0.log will  show the desired setting.\n2) In my former answer I proposed to create a file in /etc/X11/Xsession.d/ containing string xrandr --dpi 90. This worked in 12.04, but in 16.04 this setting isn't persistent. In newer systems we can add the desired value on session start. Run \"Startup Applications\", press \"Add\" button, name it \"Fix DPI\" and set the command xrandr --dpi 90 in the field. Save the changes and re-login. Now xdpyinfo | grep dots will report 90x90 dots.\nIf xdpyinfo still shows 96 then add a timeout before running xrandr. Edit the command in \"Startup Applications\" and change it to:\nbash -c \"sleep 15; xrandr --dpi 90\"\n\nReference \nStep 2 is optional for 12.04 because in older systems Step 1 fixes both Xorg.0.log and xdpyinfo values.\n3) In GNOME3 DPI setting is hardcoded to 96 and cannot be changed directly, but the text can be scaled instead. Calculate the desired multiplier: desired_DPI / 96 (in my case 90/96 = 0.9375). Now run the command (or use dconf if you prefer):\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface text-scaling-factor 0.9375\n\nChanges will be applied at once. xrdb -query | grep dpi will report the desired Xft.dpi: 90.\nP.S. There is another method to fix DPI setting which is much more difficult and it is described in this guide. I tried it also and the result was the same (at least in 12.04).\nAfterword: Only Ubuntu developers can say for certain whether values modified by Steps 1 & 2 really matter in modern Ubuntu or they are silently ignored. Only Step 3 produces the changes which are instantly noticeable. Those users who consider that certain apps may still rely on X server settings are encouraged to perform all 3 steps described above. For the rest Step 3 is sufficient - that's the sole way of customization adopted in modern Ubuntu distros.\n\nA: As far as my experience in Ubuntu goes, changing the font DPI setting changes a lot more than just the way fonts are rendered. It also applies to icons and the size of menus for example.\nIt's just that Xorg hints the Desktop Environment on what the physical display's DPI is. And yes, you can override this in the Xorg.conf, but it has the same effect as changing the setting in your DE. For example in Kubuntu/KDE:\n\n\nA: I am using Zorin8 (based on Ubuntu13.x).\nYou could scale the screen with mouse (1024/800=1.28, 768/600=1.28): \nxrandr --output LVDS1 --mode 800x600 --panning 1024x768 --scale 1.28x1.28\n\nOr only pan the screen, so you have to use the mouse to see parts that are not visible on screen: \nxrandr --output LVDS1 --mode 800x600 --panning 1024x768\n\n\nA: You can't actually change the physical ppi of your monitor.  The real ppi is the actual hardware ppi, however most software will assume a ppi of 72 dpi for historical reasons, though 96 dpi is not uncommon now.\nYou can change the resolution of the monitor, which changes the translated ppi, and you can change things like the font size.\nIf you install MyUnity you can change the font DPI, amongst other things.\nIf you had a true 1024x768 pixel (resolution) monitor and it was true 72dpi, it would be about a 17\" monitor.  If you set a font size of 72 then a character would be 1\" high.  If you set the display to 800x600 resolution then the font would be larger, while setting 1600x1200 would make the font appear smaller.\n", "Q: Recovering moved .mod files using grubrescue I did a dumb thing...

How can I create Live USB from terminal? Is there any tool i got to do that ? \nI am using Ubuntu 12.04 .\n\nA: Yes it can be done with mtools (various)  If you have a look at this page, there's instructions for downloading the isotostick.sh script that uses mtools (you need to also install mtools).\nA look through that script will give you an idea of what is involved.\n\nA: You can use the famous (and also dangerous) Linux tool dd for this job. But take note that it will completely erase all the contents of USB drive. Also note that you can't get the facility of persistence storage with the Live USB, which means every boot to the Live System will be new.\nUsing dd\nFirst take note of the device number of your USB drive with the command sudo blkid. Most probably, it will be /dev/sdb or /dev/sdc. Almost all of the time, it cannot be /dev/sda.\nThen open a terminal with the Ctrl+Alt+T shortcut and use this command (I'm assuming your USB drive is /dev/sdb).\nsudo dd if=/path-to-the-iso-file/filename.iso of=/dev/sdb\n\nThe command will run for some time. When you see the prompt $ in your terminal, you're done.\nUsing cat\nYou can also use the cat command. Open a terminal and enter the command like below:\nsudo cat /path-to-ubuntu-iso/iso-filename.iso > /dev/sdb; sync\n\nReplace the /dev/sdb with your system-specific USB drive number.\nPlease note that you need to specify the output device as /dev/sdb or /dev/sdc, not /dev/sdb1, /dev/sdc1, etc.\nUpdate for the updated question\nNot all distros can be made bootable using the dd method. One such example is OpenSUSE DVD (not the live one). So it is not possible to use dd to make a bootable iso for every Linux distro, but the dd method should work for all live distros.\n", "Q: Do I have to be careful if installing ubuntu on hdd with Win 8?

You could just mount the Windows 7 partition and then run update-grub.\nRelated question\n\n\n*\n\n*Unable to mount Windows (NTFS) filesystem due to hibernation\n\nA: I had the same problem and had spent 2 days figuring it out. But today I had this sudden idea in the morning and it worked out. \nYou should review your bios/uefi settings. In my case I had to let Uefi boot first. Otherwise I wasn't able to detect windows from ubuntu. What I had to set was ubuntu > Windows Boot Manager > DISK1 > DISK2 > DISK3. Insted DISK1 > ubuntu > Windows Boot Manager > DISK3.\nI had 2 ubuntu installations one on hdd and one on ssd. Apparently ssd installation wasn't showing as UEFI for some reasone but I wanted boot faster disk first.\nI wasn't expecting that order of boot can influence grub in detecting systems. So it is worth to review that.\n\nA: I had the same issue after I installed the updates from ubuntu. The following commands worked for me perfectly:\nsudo apt-get install os-prober\n\nFirst install os-prober to detect windows and then update grub:\nsudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg\n\n\nA: In addition to the answer of Bartosz Dabrowski, which lead me to solving my problem:\nBe sure that if your Linux uses UEFI Boot/GPT that your other OS (eg. Windows in my case) also uses UEFI Boot/GPT. Coming from an old Win7 to Win10 installation the hard drive still had old school boot and MBR. Somehow os-prober and boot-repair had their problems to fix this.\nEnsure that in BIOS / Boot order there is your HDD with ubuntu (eg. uefi: ubuntu) and your HDD with Windows Boot Manager (eg. uefi: Windows Boot Manager) to be found.\nIf WBM is missing ensure that windows boot disk has GPT. You can check this in Windows using Disk Management (Win + X, then Disk Management).\nThere is a Windows tool: mbr2gpt which can convert your MBR to GPT. After doing so (and booting via UEFI) os-prober and finally update-grub was able to find my Windows installation and added it to the boot options of grub.\n\nA: Okay, so I had the same problem and couldn't find a solution for me out there for a long time, finally got it, so here is my little grain of sand to the world. Before you try, remember to check you are booting using UEFI everytime you can:\nApparently, in the process of installing Debian the Windows data inside the EFI partition was lost, so what I did is a System restore using a Windows 10 USB (I tried fixing the boot but somehow it didn't work, I even tried it on console, anyways I lost no data). After this, now I coulnd't boot Debian, so I run a Debian live CD, mounted everything and chrooted like this (and don't forget to boot the USB as UEFI):\nmount /dev/your_linux_partition /mnt\ncd /mnt\nmount -t proc /proc proc/\nmount -t sysfs /sys sys/\nmount --rbind /dev dev/\nmount --rbind /sys/firmware/efi/efivars sys/firmware/efi/efivars/\nmount /dev/your_efi_partition /boot/efi/\nchroot /mnt /bin/bash\n\nNow, here os-prober didn't detect Windows 10, but I decided to grub-install /dev/sda and grub-update anyways and restart.\nHere is the funny thing, now I couldn't boot Windows 10 and only Debian, BUT!, I tried once again to grub-update and finally found the Windows 10 boot. This doesn't make any sense honestly, but I don't care. Hope it helps anyone as desperate as me :D .\n", "Q: Samsung series 5 ultra - suspend on lid closing is disabled by kernel I have a Samsung series 5 ultra (np530U4c - ivy bridge/Nvidia version).\nThe machine won't suspend on lid closing.\nI has worked on fresh install. \nAfter it I added \"pcie_aspm=force i915.i915_enable_rc6=1 i915.i915_enable_fbc=1 i915.lvds_downclock=1\" to grub defaults. \nAfter It the suspen not worked anymore. ...Neither with extra params nor without them.\nI think the kernel switched off the lid closing detection, because it won't work on windows too.\nHow can i fix this?\n\nMy laptop bricked and the service changed the mother board so I got this problem twice.\n\nA: These kernel bug reports are related to your issue:\nhttps://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=44161\nhttps://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45461\nAccording to the information in those reports, you can temporarily fix your problem by doing the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power the computer down\n\n*Remove AC plug\n\n*Cut the battery power (it's a small hole on the bottom of the device, hold pressed for 5-10 seconds)\n\n*Plug AC power in before you power the device on\n\n\nHowever, the problem will return next time you boot Ubuntu until those bugs are fixed.\n", "Q: How to short this command? Every time I need to use sublime to open a project from terminal, I have to do this:\nnohup sublime . &\n\nIs there a way to short it?\n\nA: You can shorten commands by creating an alias. Aliases should be put in ~/.bash_aliases (not in ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile).\nAlias in .bash_aliases\nYou can create ~/.bash_aliases with the following command:\ntouch ~/.bash_aliases\n\nYou can now edit the file and put your alias in there in the format:\nalias cmd='command'\n\nFor example:\nalias subl='nohup sublime . &'\n\nBe warned that if your define an alias that has the same name as a command, the alias takes precedence. This can be useful:\nalias ls='ls -alF --color=auto'\n\nWill always give you coloured, classified, complete lists when using ls.\nWhy not in .bashrc or .profile?\n.bashrc and .profile are usually filled with all kind of nifty things by default. While this is certainly useful, it's not convenient when adding aliases yourself. Someone has apparently thought of this and added the following to the default .bashrc:\n# Alias definitions.\n# You may want to put all your additions into a separate file like\n# ~/.bash_aliases, instead of adding them here directly.\n# See /usr/share/doc/bash-doc/examples in the bash-doc package.\n\nif [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then\n    . ~/.bash_aliases\nfi\n\nIf .bash_aliases exists, it's loaded by .bashrc and you have an entire file for all your aliases. If you install the bash-doc package there are some examples that can be found in:\n /usr/share/doc/bash-doc/examples/startup-files/Bash_aliases\n\n\nA: You can make command short by editing .bashrc file and add the following line at the end of the file.\n\nalias new_command='long old_command'\n\nFor here you can use \n\nalias newcommand = nohup sublime . &\n\n\nA: You could make a wrapper script something like this -\nmkdir -p ~/bin\necho \"nohup sublime . &\" > ~/bin/sbl\nchmod 700 ~/bin/sbl\n\nNow typing sbl will have the effect you want (though if you didn't already have a ~/bin folder, you may have to log out & log back in once first so your PATH is correct).\nIt's traditional to use aliases for this, but I have always preferred using wrappers because they are more flexible if you decide to edit them to do more complex tasks later.\n\nA: Add following to your .bashrc:\n alias sblm='nohup sublime . &'\n\nThis will create an alias for the command. You can always execute then sblm, which will be evaluated as nohup sublime . & by your shell.\n", "Q: Why can't I checkout with subversion 1.7 on a mounted cifs share?

I noticed that though my laptop was fully charged and plugged in, its battery LED was changing color between orange (indicating charging) and yellow (indicating fully charged) continuously. So I removed my battery and inserted back to its slot (didn't switch off my laptop, so everything else remained same). This solved the issue, and since then the touch-pad is working perfectly fine.\n", "Q: Possibility to encrypt files to only be used on the current PC Is it possible to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Allow user to access anything on PC\n\n*Encrypt information in a way that it can only be accessed from that particular PC.\n\n*If user tries to clone/dd/gpart copy the information it will not work.\n\n\nA: What you want is an encrypted home directory. This will allow you to access all of your files when you are logged in, but anyone trying to view the contents of your home directory from a different account or a Live CD will not be able to access your files. There is an excellent article on How-To Geek on setting this up here.\n\nA: I think this is a bit like \"print-protected PDFs\" -- anything that you'd come up with would work only based on goodwill or indolence. If a file is readable, it can be copied. If a user has admin password on the top of it (otherwise low-level access to hd is not possible, and you explicitly mention it in 3.), the copying becomes trivial.\n\nA: All of the answers to this problem are going to have the same exact caveat: there isn't much you can do if someone has physical access to your data. Your second requirement just isn't possible, anyone with the key to your encrypted drive can access that encrypted data on any machine.\nThe best solution is encrypting the drives with a keyfile instead of a password and then keeping those keyfiles on an encrypted USB stick that uses a password. This way you need both the USB drive and the password to access the drives. Two-Form authentication is currently the best bet against attacks.\n", "Q: Port an existing Quickly app from 12.04 to 12.10? I've developed an app using Quickly on a 12.04 system.  In preparation for the 12.10 release, I'd like to have launchpad build a version for Quantal so that it can be used and tested by people from my ppa.  I'm not willing to upgrade my system yet (I depend on it for work), how can I do this from 12.04 and my current quickly project?  I have a virtualbox with 12.10 installed for testing, but I don't want to copy over the quickly project if I don't have to.\nIdeally, an answer should work with the quickly submitubuntu command so that it is packaged for installation in the /opt/extras.ubuntu.com directory.\nEdit: I posted one solution below, but it makes the numbering go out of sync. If anyone has a better idea, please post an answer\n\nA: Figured it out... This should work for building binaries for any arbitrary release.  Just do the following:\nquickly configure target-distribution quantal\nquickly submitubuntu\n\nYou should be able to just sequentially reconfigure for each distribution. Unfortunately this puts the release numbering out of order. I don't know how to synchronize release numbering over multiple target-distributions.\n\nA: I think this site could help you with the distribution packaging of your quickly app on launchpad. I had the same problem before, and now my app also runs on Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal Quetzal.\n", "Q: How to increase the amount of steps of brightness adjustment-key The screen of my laptop (Dell Vostro 3460) supports 16 levels of brightness: Not only according to the manufacturer, but also as is clear from two OSs: Both Windows 7 and Ubuntu (dual-booted) support all levels. On Windows 7, the hotkeys for brightness adjustment support all levels. \nIn ubuntu it is apparent when going on the brightness slidebar (see picture below) from left to right; I can count 16 different levels of brightness when doing so.\n\nWhen using the hotkeys (Fn+F4 and Fn+F4), however, only 5 levels are supported. How can I adjust these levels and make them in line with what my screen supports?\n\nA: While the question is a little different to your question, I found a possible cure when answering this question Cannot change brightness \nAfter I had completed this, I found that I had the full numbers of steps that I was looking for, rather than the 4 I was being given before.\nBasically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal with  Ctrl + Alt + T\n\n*I typed in sudo gedit /etc/default/grub, entered my password\n\n*I changed the line which read \n\n\n*\n\n*GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"\" to \n\n*GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"acpi_backlight=vendor\" (Note: not the vendors name)\n\n\n*Saved and Closed gedit.\n\n*in Terminal I updated the Grub with sudo update-grub\n\n*I re-booted the laptop\n\n\nA: Same solution as one-liner\nFor this solution no nano knowledge is required. It is also handy for multi-machine installation scripts.\nsudo sed -i 's|^GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash\"|GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"quiet splash acpi_backlight=vendor\"|' /etc/default/grub && sudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: Text based installation for Server I'm trying to install Ubuntu 11.04 server on one of my machines (1U server) but graphics at the time of installation has an issue. Previously I would remove HDD connect it to other computer, install and put it back.\nHowever I want a method to install on 1U server directly as it is being pain to do it so many times.\nI read alternate CD is the only way, and alternate CD contains exactly same packages as Desktop CD. Now here is a problem I want Server packages and Text based installation.\nIf anyone know if there are particular boot options or some way to use alternate CD for Server packaged let me know.\nBTW I've followed http://www.ubuntu.com/start-download (which says everything under link is Text based installer) but I don't think thats the case\n\nA: If you click on the link for Precice Pangolin on that page, then click on ubuntu-12.04.1-server-amd64.iso  for the 64 bit server release, it will download what you need - A text based installer for the 64 bit server edition.  \nDon't forget to also get the md5sums file and check the iso after you have dowloaded and before you try to burn it.\n\nA: We use 11.04 server here.  Maybe try https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+cdmirrors\n for a mirror and then select either 32 or 64 bit under Server install CD from the mirror of your choice. \nOn a lot of servers it is the 3d graphics that mess you up and don't handle the mouse correctly. Sometimes I use a version 10 desktop and run from CD to format and partition drives etc. \nAlso note that some Dell (and probably other brand) servers may not have their drives seen by some versions of Ubuntu. The driver on the setup CD is not fully compatible with the dell raid drives and/or Grub has a hard time with them. In that case the alternate CD usually works or just try an older/newer version to get the install done. \nGood luck  \n", "Q: Juju bootstrap error tried all solutions with no success! Now what?

https://www.dropbox.com/s/a59d2hyabo02q5z/jockey.log\n\nA: Obtain the latest driver here by answering the 5 questions provided. This worked for me.\n", "Q: Windows dual boot installation - will Ubuntu take all the space? I have Windows 7 installed, and it's taking up 51GB of space. I don't know whether or not it is in a partition in my C drive, but I have 450GB free space. \nWhen I install Ubuntu does it use ALL of the free space as a partition for Ubuntu, or does it just use whatever amount it needs? I'm hoping the installer will know how much space to allocate to Ubuntu and not take all the free space.\n\nA: First, The C drive in your Windows 7 is a partition and most likely a primary partition. Your computer may have other partitions, such as the recovery or the systems partition. A computer can have up to 4 primary partitions. If yours came with 4 already, you won't be able create new ones needed for Ubuntu installation without deleting one primary partition. The newer computers with GPT partition table does not have this limitation. Let's say for now, your computer does not have this problem. You should read more about disk partitioning to familiarize yourself with various terms.\nSecond, During the installation of Ubuntu from a Live CD or USB you will get three choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install side by side with Windows\n\n*Replace Windows 7\n\n*Something Else\nThe third choice are for advanced users. The first and second are self explanatory. I think you may want to stick to the first. Read the answers to this question for an overall description: How do I install Ubuntu?.\nThird, when you choose the first option you will be able to decide how much space you want to allocate to Ubuntu and how much to retain for Windows. See this questions for some explanations on this choice: Installing Ubuntu with Windows, which is left and right when allocating space?.\nWhen you make that choice, the installer will use the space you allocated and create the two necessary partitions needed for Ubuntu, the / (in ext4 format) and the Linux Swap. \nAs for how much space you should allocate, that is a different question.\nI hope this is helpful.\n", "Q: I cannot install Ubuntu on my laptop running Windows 8 \nPossible Duplicate:\nInstalling Ubuntu on a Pre-Installed UEFI Supported Windows 8 system \n\nI installed Ubuntu 12.04 (ubuntu-12.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso) to my 4GB USB Sandisk drive so that I could install it on my laptop. I was able to get to the setup but when I would get to the part where it would ask me if I want to replace Windows or install next to it I chose to install next to it and then it would restart the computer. I wanted to try using Wubi.exe to install it from Windows but I'm afraid to do that since all it says for destination is C: which is the place I use for Windows 8. I can run Ubuntu off the USB stick but I'd like to install it next to Windows 8 so that I can dual-boot between the two.\n\nA: Windows 8 introduce two features :\n\n\n*\n\n*UEFI witch is instead of BIOS\n\n*Secure Boot witch prevent anything but the installed operating system (here it's windows) to boot\n\n\nThe procedure is quite complex. Look at this question for further information :\nHow to install Ubuntu on UEFI enabled HP Pavilion HPE h9 tower\n", "Q: Installing UBUNTU 12.10 correctly on Dell Inspiron 6000 with 2 GB ram \nPossible Duplicate:\nThere’s an issue with an Alpha/Beta Release of Ubuntu, what should I do? \n\nI installed UBUNTU 12.10 after creating a Disk from the ISO file. Apparently everything installed correctly but after first reboot, system doesnt run. Any suggestions what I am doing wrong?\n\nA: 12.10 is the development release and is still in beta.  You should try installing 12.04 LTS, or wait until 12.10 is released in a few weeks.\n", "Q: Where is the list with the wallpapers (shown in the appearance window) stored? When trying to add wallpapers from previous Ubuntu versions & those I found on the internet (following these instructions), I somehow messed up the list of wallpapers included in the appearance window: Most wallpapers are doubled, and only one of the wallpapers I added in the /usr/share/backgrounds folder got permanently added to the list shown.\n\nNow, what I wonder: Where is the list stored of pictures shown in the appearance window? Or is there no such list? In the latter case: What factors determine which pictures in the backgrounds folder are displayed (and which aren't)?\n\nA: *\n\n*You will find the wallpaper files -- backgrounds in the directory /usr/share/backgrounds/ (but you already know that).\n\n*The lists of these files are found in XML files in /usr/share/gnome-background-properties/.\n", "Q: \"What's New\" is missing in Software Centre I've just reinstalled Ubuntu 12.04.01 and noticed that the What's New section in the Software Centre is missing. \nHas this happened to anyone else?

At any rate, it looks like X is detecting it in some capacity (unless you hand-wrote that xorg.conf), so the driver is probably already installed.\nMy second suggestion:  Read through this thread and see if you can get any joy using those tips.  The only part that looks substantially different from your setup is the part about \"add[ing] the following to /etc/gdm/Init/Default above the \"exit 0\" at the end of the file:\"\n### set display for attached USB devices\nXRANDR=`gdmwhich xrandr`\nif [ \"x$XRANDR\" != \"x\" ] ; then\n$XRANDR -o 0\nfi\n\nFinally, look through your X logs; sometimes (!) useful info can be gleaned from them.  Or post them here; I'd be happy to take a look at them.\n\nA: I think you might need to specify \nOption \"Xinerama\" \"Off\" \n\nin your ServerLayout section. This would prevent you dragging windows between the monitors, but might help.\nYou may also want to try reducing your Depth to 16 from 24.\nFinally, you could try using the fbdev driver for your Radeon as well - this would seriously reduce the performance of this card.\nMake sure you make backups of your xorg.conf before you make any changes at all.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install Unity 6.x.x on 12.04? Is it possible to get the latest Unity without upgrading to 12.10 on my Ubuntu 12.04 PC or will this be backported?\n\nA: This Works:\nOpen Terminal, then type\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:benkai/precise-unity-backport\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nsudo apt-get remove unity-lens-applications\n\nsudo apt-get install unity\n\nwget http://ppa.launchpad.net/benkai/precise-unity-backport/ubuntu/pool/main/u/unity-lens-applications/unity-lens-applications_6.4.0-0ubuntu2_i386.deb\n\nsudo dpkg -i unity-lens-applications_6.4.0-0ubuntu2_i386.deb\n\nFrom:\nhttps://launchpad.net/~benkai/+archive/precise-unity-backport\n\nA: An official backport won't happen, no.\nBecause Unity 6.0 depends on the latest Quantal versions of Nux and Compiz, which in turn depend on the newer versions of other libraries, like libunity-webapps, indicators, etc. Unity 5.x, however, will continue to be supported for the entire life cycle of Ubuntu 12.04 with stable release upgrades to fix bugs.\nIt would be possible for a community developer to take the source code of Unity 6.0 and dependent libraries, try building it with Precise libraries (many modifications would be needed) and put it up in a PPA, but it won't be worth the effort.\n\nA: Yes, you can get the latest version and build it manually, I haven't tried this, but some people succeeded on doing it:\nHow do I build Unity from source?\nSince it contains only some bug fixes, It's not that great updating it to version 6.\n\nA: I tried to give it a Google and found this link referring to Unity backporting from Quantal to Precise which may be of some use to you.\n\nA: It all depends on dependencies, really. If the dependencies for 6.2 can be satisfied, then it is likely it will be backported to Ubuntu 12.04 in the near future.\n", "Q: How do I change the IP adress given for the shared connection? I currently have my desktop PC dual booting Windows 7 and Ubuntu.  The PC has a wireless card installed.  I run a LAN cable from the PC to my Xbox 360.  In Windows 7, I can bridge the wireless and wired connections so that my Xbox gets an internet connection and its own IP address.  From my router, I can then open ports to my Xbox that it needs.\nWhen I boot into Ubuntu, however, I run into issues.  I have the wired connection set to \"Shared to other computers\" under IPv4 settings as it should be.  The Xbox then has internet connection.  Instead of having a 192.x.x.x IP address which I could open ports to, however, it is given a 10.x.x.x address.  My router won't allow me to open ports to this address since it's on a separate subnet.\nHere's the question:\nHow can I change the connection share so that it keeps my Xbox on the same subnet?  \n\nA: In graphical way u can try this link\nhttp://www.howtogeek.com/116409/how-to-turn-your-ubuntu-laptop-into-a-wireless-access-point/\nfrom command prompt try below\nHi you need to configure hostapd\nI have configure following in hostapd /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf with WPA authentication options for wireless users\n01 interface=wlan0\n02 driver=nl80211\n03 ssid=dontMessWithVincentValentine\n04 hw_mode=g\n05 channel=6\n06 macaddr_acl=0\n07 auth_algs=1\n08 ignore_broadcast_ssid=0\n09 wpa=3\n10 wpa_passphrase=KeePGuessinG\n11 wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK\n12 wpa_pairwise=TKIP\n13 rsn_pairwise=CCMP\nsudo hostapd /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf\n", "Q: How to save machine state without hibernating? I wonder is it possible to capture the state of the machine without actually hibernating? The goal would be to make a \"backup state\", so if the system crashes, one could boot directly to a session with all the windows opened, all the tabs in the browser restored etc.\nI think it might not be doable -- saving a snapshot of the memory, then changing the data on the hard drive, and then again restoring the snapshot would result in broken file descriptors etc. For example, a process opened a file before the snapshot was taken, and when the snapshot was restored, the file is no longer existing.\nBut maybe there is an ingenious way of solving that?\n\nA: If you're willing to keep all of the mounted block filesystems completely untouched (that is, mounted only in read-only mode, as an ext4 journal will be modified even without any changes for example), and unmount others (eg NFS) before freezing, then yes.\nYou can use the kernel parameters noresume and resume= to specify whether you want to reboot into your frozen state or not.\nThe sequence would be:\n\n\n*\n\n*To snapshot, suspend to disk, boot your system without resuming (noresume) or another system altogether (like a livecd), copy the swap partition elsewhere, then reboot with the correct resume= and use your system.\n\n*To go back to the frozen state, boot again with noresume or from another system, copy the swap partition back, then reboot with the correct resume= again.\nI wouldn't recommend this though. Virtualization offers a much safer and tested way to achieve your results with fewer caveats.\n", "Q: Can I share the two lists of downloads with Transmission and Transmission-daemon? I just discovered transmission-daemon so I installed it to use RPC calls. I successfully added a torrent, but when I launched Transmission in Unity, there was no trace of the download.  \nI discovered later that I was in the web interface. So one simple question : can I share the two lists of downloads (Transmission GTK and Transmission-daemon) in both interfaces ?\n\nA: transmission-daemon and transmission-gtk can share torrent lists by specifying the config folder on startup with the -g command line option.\nFor example to start transmission-daemon with the same settings and torrent list as transmission-gtk, you would exit transmission-gtk, then start transmission-daemon with\ntransmission-daemon -g $HOME/.config/transmission\n\nYou wouldn't want to do this while transmission-gtk was still running, of course.\n\nA: Actually, it seems like it's impossible : (sorry, I only found it in French)\n\n\"Les deux applications ne se parlent pas\" (i.e. \"Both applications doesn't communicate\") Ubuntu-fr/transmission\n\nBut, I found that Transmission GTK is already packaged with a web UI and a RPC server. So in Transmission->Edit->Preferences, go to \"Web\" tab, and check \"Enable Web UI\". Be sure to stop the daemon or the two will be on the same port and that will cause some troubles.\nNow, if you go to localhost:9091 or any port number you defined, you will see the same UI, but now with the same download list as in Transmission.\n", "Q: Facebook and Hotmail site don't work In Facebook website, when I enter my username and password and \"log in\", it doesn't allow me to get through.

Not a problem with your internet service or connectivity.\nTo see if this is the problem, log out and log in as the Guest selectable from the login screen and attempt to log in via firefox from there.\nAlternatively install an alternative browser and attempt to log in from for example; Chromium instead.\nIf you can sucessfully log in, then you must change the settings in your firefox browser to allow your sites to store cookies. If you don't have many bookmarks or important history you could just delete the .mozilla directory in your home folder (show hidden files first). Otherwise you should go into the profferences for firefox and allow cookies for those sites.\nI'd also check to see if you have any extensions which could cause these issues.\n\nA: The web browser may be blocking cookies.\nTry to change the settings in the web browser to \"accept all cookies.\"\n", "Q: Can't install Ubuntu one While trying to install Ubuntu one it throws me this error - \nW:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/rabbitvcs/ppa/ubuntu/dists/**DISTRIBUTION**/main/binary-amd64/Packages 404 Not Found,\nW:Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/rabbitvcs/ppa/ubuntu/dists/**DISTRIBUTION**/main/binary-i386/Packages 404 Not Found,\nE:Some index files failed to download.

Is it possible to install Ubuntu on a PS2? How?\n\nA: The processor of the PS2, called the \"Emotion Engine\", is a processor from the MIPS family.

I am running off of Fios Internet and the WiFi keep disconnecting and prompts me to retype the password for reconnecting. If you guys could give me a step by step process of how I should go about fixing this I would GREATLY appreciate it!\n\nA: Your problem appears from your description to be a misbehaving network-manager. To find out more information about the problem it's important to gather up the output from network manager as it's attempting to make a connection to your wifi network.\nBefore you follow these instructions, please save these instructions, what we are about to do with disable your internet on the machine and you may loose the ability to read how to switch it back on if you don't save them.\nThe instructions to gather the information will need you to go into a command line, you can simply go to the search button in the left top corner and type in 'command', you'll see a little black screen icon called 'Terminal' click on it.\nFirstly we must stop the network manager by copying and pasting this command. This will ask you for your password:\ngksu service network-manager stop\n\nNext we want to start the manager and capture the information from it:\ngksu NetworkManager --no-daemon &> ~/Desktop/debug.txt\n\nIt shouldn't return you back to the prompt. Now with this running attempt to connect to your wifi service through the normal means. You should have noticed the network icon in the right corner disappear when you stopped the service and reappear when you started it again. Try a couple of times to record a few instances in the log file.\nYou'll notice a new file on your desktop called debug.txt, you need to send this to who-ever will be debugging your problem. In this case you should attach it to this question by editing the original question (don't post a new answer) add in the log file contents.\nTo start the network-manage properly you should hold [ctrl] and press [C] this should stop the special network manager service and return you to the prompt. Then simply type this command to start the normal service again:\ngksu service network-manager start\n\nWe'll work out what your problem is from there.\n", "Q: Compatibility Ubuntu with GIGABYTE GA-Z77X-UD5H-WB WIFI I want to buy a GIGABYTE GA-Z77X-UD5H-WB WIFI motherboard.\nCan I install Ubuntu or another Linux OS on a computer with this motherboard?\nIf this is possible: where I can download the drivers for this motherboard or are they already in the Ubuntu installation package?\nThank you.\n\nA: From what I've read on the specs it looks as though you should be good to go. I've used GIGABYTE motherboards before and they work out of the box. No need to install additional drivers, that is unless you have a dedicated video card.

Switch -server KNOWN to -server IGNORE and -client IGNORE to -client KNOWN.\nThis will make the -client flag \"known\" to the java executable, and make it ignore the -server flag, thus making it the default. \nThe original file (client vm as default):\n# Copyright (c) 2003, Oracle and/or its affiliates.

After some status text flashed by, you should arrive at the menu again, but with network drivers loaded. From there, select the option root to \"drop to [a] root shell prompt.\"\nYou can then use sudo apt-get remove to remove the packages in question.\nAlso refer to fabricator4's answer to get info on what packages should be removed.\n\nA: Start by loading the network drivers before dropping to the root shell, then reverse the installation of the Intel module:\nsudo apt-get remove xserver-xorg-video-intel\n\nDo you in fact have an Intel video card?  Which one.  You can get some information on it from\nlshw -C display\n\nif you are not root when you try to do this you will need to prefix it with sudo\n\nA: Ok, I managed to find a work around.\nFirst select dpkg on recovery menu, then select root and execute dhclient eth0 to load the network drivers.

I finally got Windows XP to work again. So I blitzted the Ubuntu partition and the swap partition and was about to install the sixth try when it occurred to me that ought to ask how is is \"supposed\" to go. My installer will install Ubuntu on the Linus ext4 partition I created by hand in Windows on my C drive. But the installer keeps insisting on installing the OS on my D drive unless I intervene. So if I choose \"do something else\" it will accept installing Ubuntu on the C drive in the partition I previously created, but it insists on putting the \"Device for boot loader installation\" on the D drive. I can select a different drive at this point (where I could not with the \"along side windows choice) but what drive to I choose??? It lists sda, sda1, sda5, sdb and sdb1. The five times before this all ended in disaster letting the installer choose. So I need human intervention. Where is the safe place to do this. The results from the previous attempts left me with only the Ubuntu that would boot, the boot to windows from the grub menu failed every time. Is there a better version of Ubuntu I can use? Is V12.04.01 messed up? My goal is still to use Wine on it to run PC programs. I would like to find a shell or skin or something that makes it seem like windows but have the security and power of Linux under the good. I have seen this type of system and it worked very well. I know I am getting long winded but I have been though at least four of the seven rings of hell already, so I want this install to be the last.\n\nA: You should allow GRUB to be installed to sda which is your master boot record (mbr). If Windows will not boot from the GRUB menu entry at first, then select Ubuntu from the menu to boot. Once Ubuntu has loaded open a terminal and enter sudo update-grub. You will need to enter your password here to complete the operation. This command will have GRUB probe for all OSes on your machine including XP and will add them to your GRUB menu. Now when you reboot and select Windows from the GRUB menu, it should boot normally.\n\nA: Is this set of installs your first experience with Ubuntu or Linux in general? If so i would recommend that you install using wubi. You should be able to just insert the disk while windows is running and let autorun install ubuntu as if its any other application. Its a lot simpler for you to try it out for the first time, rather than giving up due to frustration (you seem to have higher thresholds than most i know tho..)  \nGetting back to the problem at hand. It appears that you are using 2 physical harddisks, from the sda-sdb drives (C drive and D isnt clear since it typically refers to partitions and not necessarily drives). You should be able to follow matt davis's advice and force the installer to install in sda, any other option would render ubuntu unreachable since windows doesnt know what linux is... \n", "Q: Wine settings to correct color palette?

I have tried many different distros, including ubuntu, lubuntu, xubuntu, linux mint, peppermint os,etc, and with all of them, I have had the same results.\nEver since installing ubuntu, I faced problems with getting my wireless card to work. The network manager applet would tell me that I was connected with a wireless Port, but I would still be unable to use the internet (Browsers returning \"not connected to network\").

Or is there a method to cool down my laptop, even when I am charging? (My laptop doesn't heat up when I run windows 7.)\nThanks!\n\nA: Well, most of the laptops heat up when you connect to charging. You can fix this most of the time by installing a proprietary display driver. Goto Settings>Additional Drivers and see if you can activate a proprietary display driver. \n\nA: You may want to update to the latest kernel (3.8 may be the best). It may also help to use a driver that is in the kernel instead of a proprietary driver. Often times, more than one driver can handle a device. Non-proprietary drivers are usually better to use on Linux system than the proprietary counterparts.\nYou may also be interested in filing a Linux kernel bug on Launchpad.net so that the Ubuntu developers can offer better support for your hardware and not heat up your CPU.\n", "Q: Automatically disable a ppa Is there a way to automatically delete or disable a ppa that does not work anymore?\nWhen I do apt-get update I get a lot of error message regarding some ppas that cant be found.\nI have disabled them by hand for now, but is there a way to disable them automatically?

First it checks the ppa .list (input by user) is present or not. Then put or remove a # in front the lines accordingly.\nThe code acts in a very interactive manner. When someone runs this along with ppa name as its argument, it will display the PPA's current status and what the code is going to do on successful execution. Then it will ask permission of the user. Only if the user inputs 'y' to confirm the code will change the status of the PPA and activate/deactivate it. It will immediately abort if the user puts an 'n' for no.\nNote I proposed this code in this answered. glutanimate helped a lot to improve the code.\n\nA: Disabling a PPA using the Ubuntu Software Sources is a big hassle, as there is no way to filter or order (in a humanly useful way) the PPAs.

I was reading the latest issue of Full Circle (issue 63) and there was an article comparing boot times under various configurations. One of the comparisons was with an installation in a primary partition and with an extended partition. Now, I was shocked to see a graph see significant increases in boot times when the system was installed on an extended partition. \nQuickly after, suspicion set in: How is it that simply being in a workaround environment to get around the limitations on the number of partitions allowed magically decreases I/O performance? Is there something I'm missing?\nText from the article:\n\nTo my mind, the internal hard drive and the SD card represent just\n  about the respective best and worst physical speeds available for our\n  test computer.\nAt the same time, I also wanted to know if using a primary hard drive\n  partition (/dev/sda1) or an extended partition (/dev/sda5) had any\n  effect at all. What I got is shown [below].\n\n\n\nA: I think that rather than the logical structure, which should not have any impact on performance, you might be observing a difference in speed due to physical locations of the partitions on the drive. The first partition might be faster than the last one.\nThe key to a fast boot process is low access speed (rather than transfer rates); this is why SSD will allow you to boot in seconds rather than minutes. \nHowever, the access speeds in a hard drive can vary depending on the physical location that the reading heads need to access; the access speeds may vary as much as twofold. The main reason behind that is that as rotation speed is constant for the whole disk, more area passes under the heads on the rim rather than the area near the center of the plate. Some more information about that here.\nAnother thing that might influence the access speed is the partition size: the smaller the partition, the higher the speed. Here you will find the results of a test that shows how the performance can drop depending on how large a partition is.\n", "Q: How to format a USB drive? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to format a USB flash drive?\nHow do I clear everything (data, viruses) from a thumbdrive? \n\nHow to format a pen drive in Ubuntu?\nI have this pen drive which I made bootable using some other system (OS).\nBut I need to format it from my Ubuntu 12.04.

I have three files containing names of mysql tables line by line. My script has this line -  \nmysqldump -h localhost -uroot --lock-tables=false db < $2 > ~/backup/$name'.sql'\n\nI am using getopts to handle some options. So basically $2 is the file I am going to provide. This file has - table1 and table2. So this command should only take backup of these two tables. \nBut when I cat the ~/backup/name.sql file it shows all the backup of db. I am not sure if it is the combined backup of all the tables from all the 3 files or the whole db.\nBut it is taking backup of whole db instead of two tables.\nWhat am I doing wrong?\nIt works fine when I put it like this -  \nmysqldump -h localhost -uroot --lock-tables=false db table1 table2 >  ~/backup/$name'.sql'\n\n\nA: The reason why it fails is that mysqldump does not read the standard input; table1 and table2 are (optional) arguments, but you are providing them not on the command line, but on stdin. \nIf $2 is the filename of a file that contains one line with the text table1 table2, then the following should work:\nmysqldump -h localhost -uroot --lock-tables=false db `cat $2` > ~/backup/$name'.sql'\n\nBash will expand this command line to\nmysqldump -h localhost -uroot --lock-tables=false db table1 table2 > /home/user/backup/somename.sql\n\nwhich is what you want to run.\nHowever, since you are using getopt anyways, maybe you could put \"table1\" in $2 and \"table2\" in $3, and run just\nmysqldump -h localhost -uroot --lock-tables=false db $2 $3 > ~/backup/$name'.sql'\n\n\nA: It depends a bit on how your running the script but you should be able to use back-ticks and cat the file.\nmysqldump -h localhost -uroot --lock-tables=false db `cat $2` > ~/backup/$name'.sql\n\n", "Q: How to change sort order for  mail in thunderbird I am using Ubuntu 12.04 and Thunderbird came installed by default.

Create a script, say /home/user/testidea.sh (where user is your actual username, of course), containing\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n/opt/idea/bin/idea.sh 2> /tmp/idea.err > /tmp/idea.out\n\nMake it executable\nchmod a+x /home/user/testidea.sh\n\nAnd replace the respective line in the idea.desktop file by\nexec=/home/user/testidea.sh\n\nMaybe that will work, but if not, at least (hopefully) you will find what is wrong by inspecting /tmp/idea.err and /tmp/idea.out.\n\nA: In order to start debugging you can try to run the desktop file from command-line and see the response. The topic of how to cover this seems to be covered in this post.

In other words, your Windows will still run within VirtualBox (there is no way around it!) but instead of installing it on a virtual disk image (VDI), you use an existing partition with an existing Windows installation.\nYou still have to create the virtual machine, but make it use a real disk.\nAs far as I can tell, this is possible. However, you might want to read the Virtualbox manual.\n\nA: No, it won't work.\n\nDo not experiment with this on a productive machine\n\nUbuntu and Windows 7 are different operating systems. They can by definition not be run at the same time without the help of a virtualization software. As it may be possible to access a physical hard drive from a virtual machine (see this question) it is\n\n\n*\n\n*very unlikely you can actually boot the same Windows on both, a real machine and a virtual machine.\n\n*not recommended to do so as anything writing to your system files may damage the OS to become inoperable.\n\n\nYou may convert an existing Windows to a virtual machine (see this question) but then it is not much more than an additional VM that will probably clutter your hard disk space more than a newly created machine.\nMy recommendation in case you still need to dual boot to Windows would therefore be to sacrifice the hard disk space needed for a newly created Window 7 virtual machine for testing Windows 7 applications while still running Ubuntu. You may want to consider to install a reduced version of Windows 7 in this machine. This can be done with RT seven Lite.\n\nA: I've done this in the past with VMWare Player.  Before this was a pretty manual process, but now you can add a physical HDD easily.  There is a trick to initial creation, however.\nFirst create the new virtual machine, you will be forced to create a virtual disk, just set the size to 0.\nAfterwards, edit the newly created VM, remove the HDD and add a new one.  Choose 'Physical Device' and choose the device or partition.\n\nAnd now the catch.  The hardware on this will be different than the hardware on your actual machine.  It's very likely Windows will have no trouble setting this up as VMPlayer uses pretty generic hardware, but you can never be sure if you trip some Windows Genuine Advantage crap.  I never had much trouble with it, but you never know.\nThis really is no different than pulling the hard drive out and plugging it into another motherboard or something.\n", "Q: Disable/remove Cinnamon keyboard shortcurts I installed Cinnamon on Ubunt 12.04 using:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:gwendal-lebihan-dev/cinnamon-stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install cinnamon\n\nNow I am looking for a way to disable the keyboard shortcuts Alt + F7 (move window) and Alt + F8 (resize windows).\nI already disabled those key bindings under Keyboard → Shortcuts.

In order to cd into an SMB share, you have to mount it.  \nIn your case, it sounds like the SMB share was already mounted and accessible from nautilus.  That means the SMB share is already mounted somewhere in your local VFS.\nIn Ubuntu 15.04, I believe the default mount point for SMB shares (at least the ones you connect to using nautilus) is:\n/run/user/$UID/gvfs/smb:host=$SERVER_NAME\n\nSo instead, try:\n$ cd  /run/user/$UID/gvfs/smb:host=server/path/to/file.txt\n\nEdit: For a more in-depth explanation of this, here is a similar question on unix stackexchange with some great answers\n\nA: You cannot use just cd smb://server/folder from a terminal.\nTo access the folder from terminal you need to mount the folder first.\nsudo mkdir /mnt/server\n\nsudo mount -t cifs //remote/folder /mnt/server -o username=user uid=name\n\nOr just type smbclient //hostname/folder and type the username/password. After successful login you will able to access the folders.\n\nA: The shell (bash) does not use unique resource locators (URLs). \nIn addition to other answers that tell you how to mount samba shares manually, if you can access it with the file manager, it has already been mounted using gvfs. You will be able to access it throught the .gvfs/ directory in your home directory:\ncd ~/.gvfs/\nls\n\nIf I'm correct, you should see a directory called folder on server/.\n\nA: The smb protocol cannot be used like this from bash. If you want to use it, you have to mount the smb share with the mount command, or to add it to your /etc/fstab, for example (taken from my fstab):\n\n//server/smb-share /my/path/where/to/mount/it cifs  guest,uid=1000,iocharset=utf8,codepage=unicode,unicode  0  0\n\n\n\nA: If the others don't work (as is my case), you'll likely find this will:\ncd /$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/gvfs/smb-share\\:server=yourserver,share=yourshare/\nReplace yourserver and yourshare appropriately.\nIf you're using tab completion, beware of your shell incorrectly escaping out commas, dollar symbols and slashes. The colon, however, should be escaped.\n\nA: go to 'files' folder (left panel) in ubuntu, open shared folder ....^  .Then rightclik and select 'open in Terminal' >> copy address like bellow in front of your cd command\ncd /run/user/1000/gvfs/smb-share:server=xxx.xxx.x.xxx,share=[your shared folder in other system]\n", "Q: ZTE USB Modem AC2726, connection not possible in Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS It's a long post but nearly covers all my experiments and changes I did to my NM.\nHope the information is complete and if there are still question, more information can be provided.\nI've a ZTE AC2726 USB Modem (CDMA modem) which worked fine in Ubuntu 10.04 /11.10. I recently switched to 12.04.1 (precise pangolin) All 32-bit. after the switch the first issue I faced was to connect to internet using my USB modem (ISP: Reliance Brand: Netconnect).\nTried to run the drivers provided by Reliance but they are old and won't support Kernel 2.6.30 above. since the code was not downloaded with ISO image (of 12.04) i couldn't compile the files provided in such driver.\nlsusb does detect it as Modem with output similar to\n19d2:fff1 ZTE CDMA technologies inc. (or similar as i didn't note it down)\nIf it is detected as USB storage it shows 19d2:fff5 (as per few online forums, i may be wrong here).\nI used the network Manager and configured the modem to dial #777 (default) and the ISP provided username:password combination. It tries to connect to internet (3-4 times automatically)but fails to get online. \nonce I was able to connect in the monring hours and the message was flashed 'registered on CDMA home network'. I was able to run an update. the kernel was updated with 3.0.2 -pae OR something similar (can find out if required). I surfed the net for about 2 hours later before restarting. \nAfter the restart, again the Modem was not able to get me online. I kept trying for many times. I tried changing the setting in NM. \nOne evening after dark I was able to connect to network with same message flash 'registered on CDMA home network' (the message was similar, i'm not precise here,sorry). I was able to surf the net for nearly 3 hours before I switched off my Laptop.\nI'm not able to get online after that day, It's been 3 days now. I'll try the observered theory of late/early hours sometime soon as mentioned below.\nLaptop configuration :\nMake:  Lenovo \nModel: B480\nProcessor: Intel B950\nRAM: 4G DDR3 \nHDD: 500 G\nBroadcom Wireless/Bluetooth/Ethernet LAN\nOS: FreeDOS / Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (dualboot) - 32 bit\nKernel 3.0.2-pae -32-bit\nISP: Reliance Communication (India)\nUSB Modem: ZTE AC2726 (Black/silver)\nObeservation : I'm able to connect to internet in those hours when generally the speed is high (low usage by other network (wireless) users). like in early mornings or late nights. This is strange as connection should not be dependent on bandwidth usage.\nAny help would be appraciated to fix this issue. before I decide to cahnge the OS or ISP.\n\nA: I also faced the same issue, but somehow it worked for me after some tweaking.\nSolution 1: (If you have access to Windows Machine)\nJust go to the Reliance Netconnect Plus UI in Windows machine and in Settings change the 'Mode' to 'Hybrid'.\n\nBy doing this I found that the Reliance Netconnect Plus is recognized by Ubuntu quickly and   \nNow log in back to Ubuntu and connect to the internet through 'Network Manager'.\nUsing this method you will be registered on CDMA home network and can access the internet quickly.\nThe main disadvantage of this method is that we are running it under 'Hybrid' mode, which means that the internet may switch to 'CDMA 1x' mode and the internet speed will go down. \nFor me this happens only for 5-10 minutes then I'm again switched to fast Netconnect+ mode.\nTo overcome this disadvantage you may use Solution 2.\nSolution 2: (Using WVDIAL)\nIf the Reliance Netconnect Plus modem works in Solution 1 then after connecting to internet, install WVDIAL\nor\nIf you have access to GSM mobile(or GSM Modem) with cheap GPRS plan, then connect your mobile to Ubuntu through Network Manager and install WVDIAL. I have never experienced any difficulty with GSM Modem when connecting to Internet through Network Manager.\n(i) Open Terminal (Keyboard Shortcut: Ctrl + Alt + T ) and type\nsudo apt-get install wvdial\n\n(ii) Open up wvdial’s configuration file using this command\ngedit /etc/wvdial.conf\n\n(iii) Paste the below code into the window that pops up ( make sure to enter your relevant details )\n[Dialer Defaults]\nInit1 = ATZ\nInit2 = ATQ0 V1 E1 S0=0 &C1 &D2 +FCLASS=0\nStupid Mode = 1\nModem Type = USB Modem\nISDN = 0\nPhone = #777\nNew PPPD = yes\nModem = /dev/ttyUSB0 (This may also be dev/ttyUSB2 depending on where you plugged in your device)\nUsername = 9xxxxxxxxxx (your username, should be a number )\nPassword = 9xxxxxxxxxx (Your password , should be the same number)\nCBaud = 460800\n\nDelete all the comments in the brackets . The fields you should edit are Modem , Username and password the only ones with comment .\nSave and exist .\n(iv) Thats it.

I'm thinking to install the newer version i.e 12.04 , so still   is there that heating problem with Acer laptop? \nNote: There is no such heating problem with my laptop while running windows.\n\nA: As said, your problem is related to your graphics card. The Optimus dynamic graphics card switching works great on Ubuntu. You only have to install Bumblebee. Bumblebee allowed manual switching and since version 3 it allows automatic switching\nOptimus technology switches off your Nvidia card and use Intel hd graphics in your Core i5 processor when there is no need for high graphics, but switches back to Nvidia when the need comes.\nTo install bumblebee, do the following in the terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*add bumblebee repository and check updates:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable\nsudo apt-get update\n\n\n*check kernel version \nuname -a \n\nexample output:\nLinux  3.5.0-23-generic  \n\n\n*Install Bumblebee using the proprietary Nvidia driver, change number and suffix of Linux header according to Linux kernel.

When I play a video after starting the system it plays fine. After some time the video is not displayed and I can only hear sound. If I reboot my PC then the video is again displayed. I installed vlc player but it did not solve my problem.\n\nA: I had a similar problem with video and discovered that turning off screen effects- i.e. the compositor, fixed the issue. Go to the Xfce menu and click settings > settings manager > window manager tweaks and click the compositor tab so that it looks like the screenshot below. Now your video should play fine- try it with vlc and smplayer, for example. \nThe compositor seems to interfere with video playback and particularly hardware accelerated video; as you describe, video will play for a few seconds and then goes black and you are left only with the audio. Your problem seems the same as mine, so this solution will probably work for you. I am running 12.04, but the settings should be in a similar area in earlier versions as well.\n\n\nA: Check your settings in both screensaver settings, advanced tab, and Power Management to insure video is not set to turn off. Either one is fully capable of shutting down video, and not all machines respond to a keypress to turn it back on. Also, as a test, try tapping the SHIFT key every 5 minutes. If the video does not turn off, then you need to find the setting that is causing it to shut the monitor off.\n", "Q: Is it possible to revert from dualboot back to uniboot (Windows 7 Starter only)?

I am new to Ubuntu and recently started working, i wanted to set a Roaming Profile on Ubuntu Server. So user can login in from any computer and there worked can be saved directly to the Server. \nAny help suggestion wou\n\nA: One way is to install LDAP and possibly Kerberos. Kerberos will let you control the shared NFS directories with better security. If you add Samba, you can use the roaming profiles on Windows machines too.\nYou can start looking at Ubuntu Server Help Center for LDAP/Kerberos authentication and for NFS4 with Kerberos. I have this working perfectly since 2007.\nAnother way is to use Samba4 but afaik it is still in RC release. I never used it but people seems to have it working already. Maybe it is worth to give it a look to see where they are as you are starting a new install.\n\nUPDATE\nIn your comment you said you are using mysql to authenticate and you want to have roaming home directories so a possible way to do this is to export the home directories from a file server with NFS and mount them on each machine.\nI think the way to change the place of the home directoriy (if needed so you can leave the local users on /home and the network users on /nethome for example) is to use a field in MySQL like (if you didn't change nss-mysql conf file):\nhomedir varchar(32) DEFAULT '/bin/sh' NOT NULL\n\nI never did that with MySQL authentication but it should work like with LDAP.\nWhen you do this, I think it is better to use NFS with Kerberos authentication for many reasons but mainly because with it you can avoid a local root to su to any network user and access the other user home directory.\n", "Q: I want to make Tomcat7 autostart at boot I installed tomcat servlet but I need to autostart it on boot.

However, Software center keeps showing updates for rhythmbox and transmission enough though these were probably the first things i uninstalled.\nHow do i stop Software Center from showing updates for them ?\n\nA: It's possible that these packages are \"related packages\" (for lack of better term) to Rhythmbox, et. al.; libraries and dependencies that your uninstall overlooked (as often happens).\nI suggest you use the \"Computer Janitor\" utility to clean-up everything no longer needed. It's safer to do a clean-up after uninstalling this way rather than removing the packages manually.

However, even if I supply the proper credentials, it denies me access, apparently because Windows does not allow Linux connections (as they told me); sure enough, I got in when I tried to checkout from my XP partition. While I have my box dual-booted, it is inconvenient to switch just for SVN.\nSo, does anyone know how I can access that SVN repo from Ubuntu? I've tried installing TortoiseSVN and Windows Subversion under Wine but I can't even get them to run; they were asking for some DLLs that I don't know how to supply. I've thought of installing a virtual XP just for SVN but I consider that too extreme and I'd be glad if anyone can advise a simpler workaround.\nHopefully-relevant note: When I access the repo on Windows, I use the prefix file://; svn:// and https:// results to an error.

I understand that backport repository sometimes contains the newer versions of Softwares (major upgrades) and which might be included in the next Ubuntu release. But not all of the softwares aren't backported to the previous release even if it is an LTS. \nI don't really fully understand the reason behind this policy. Does this measn the next release (development version) is more important than an LTS release? Or I have missed something?\n\nA: When an Ubuntu version is released, it features get frozen. The updates provided for it is mostly security updates and patches. But major changes of software will not be released (included in the repository) for this release. \nThat is why the default enabled Ubuntu repositories include security-updates, updates and proposed repositories. The first two repositories include bug-fixes and security updates and proposed is used for testing the newer updates.\nMainly the backports repository's function as said in the Wiki is --\n\nBackports offers a way to selectively provide newer versions of software for older Ubuntu releases. Most commonly, the Backports team will provide new versions of standalone applications which can be safely updated without impacting the rest of the system. \n\nThat means, while it was perfectly valid for Canonical for not providing any newer version of standalone software (major releases), You still have a chance to install softwares which are backported. But these are only provided by backporters and they try their best to ensure that, nothing will break. (but it can break the existing softwares sometimes). That means this is a  best-effort support and that is why it is labeled as unofficial updates in software-source (software-properties-gtk).  \nIn short words, Backports are not provided by Canonical and you should be glad that some developers tried their best and invested time and energy to bring you new versions of the softwares even after the version is freezed.\nI think, I have made it somewhat clear. \nAlso take a look at this thread\n\nA: Just to add to what @Olive Twist said, LTS versions of Ubuntu are not about giving you even more cutting edge software, its about stability for the long term.\nIt is aimed at people who do not want and sometimes can not afford (like in multiple station installations, servers etc.) to install new OS or risk upgrade the OS (not to mention the time it will take to upgrade 50 machines every 6 months).\nThey can't have their system broken by some new software, and that is why LTS versions contain LESS new stuff, and are NOT using debian unstable packages (correct me if I'm wrong).\n", "Q: phpmyadmin 404 error on fresh ubuntu 12.04 install I regularly set up Virtualbox ubuntu setups to run as local webservers.

The sole reason for the critical trip point is to avoid permanent damage of the system due to thermal overrun. \n\nA: I know this an old question, but...\nCritical trip point is defined in BIOS and communicated to the OS via ACPI. Assuming the trip-point is set to some reasonable value and the OS is reading it correctly: maybe the computer is trying to tell you it's overheating.\nCheck to see if the fans (if any) are still working and the heatsink is not plugged up with dust.

How to handle it? I should print this file on paper, but it is heavy (2,3 MB) and the printing process is very slow.\nBut this is not the whole problem. I should first create another .pdf file (grayscale) with four pages on each sheet. When I try to print this file as a .pdf file, the process of creation of the new file is even slower than the printing process, and the output file is much heavier than the original (hundreds of megabytes).\nHow can I shrink the pdf file? Is there a way to create a printer friendly .pdf version of the file? Before you ask, I can't simply print it on pages. I must create this .pdf file with four pages on each sheet.\n\nA: The trick is to convert the PDF to images and back. For example, by using ImageMagick.\nInstall ImageMagick unless you have it:\nsudo apt-get install imagemagick\n\nConvert the document to images and back:\nconvert 2_gdp_issues_ita.pdf pg.png\nconvert pg*.png doc.pdf\n\nThis will give you a fast PDF document with each page as an image. You will also have several pg*.png files, one per page.\nTo get the 2x2 slides per page use montage. I added the geometry option to avoid fuzzy slide images:\nmontage  -geometry 660x -tile 2x2 pg*.png doc2x2.pdf\n\nYou can use convert to make a grayscale document:\nconvert -type Grayscale doc.pdf doc_gray.pdf\n\n", "Q: FTP won't open a connection to client I am running Windows server 2008 on Ubuntu server 12.04.1 via devstack and I am trying to download a file from an ftp server using the windows command line ftp client.\nWhen I run the ftp get command I get the following error message:\n\n500 I won't open a connection to 10.0.0.2 (only to XX.XX.XX.XX)\n  425 No data connection\n\n10.0.0.2 is the internal IP address of the instance, whereas XX.XX.XX.XX is the external address.

At home, I have a dock with dual monitors. I have a pretty decent setup - things work almost perfectly (hence the reason I'm reluctant to upgrade... that and I'm not 100% sold on Unity). \nAnyway, the only annoyance I have is that when I'm on travel, I use the laptop screen. When I un-dock the laptop, I need to manually go into nvidia x-server settings and change the resolution from 'Auto' to 1920x1200, or it will think I have two screens, and my mouse pointer will be able to go way off the left side of the screen. This isn't a big deal, but I need to do it every time I restart the x-server (so if I reboot, or have to kill it, etc...)\nWhat would be really nice is if there was a way for it to automatically detect whether or not there is external monitors (which it seems to do already), and switch into the mode I select, depending on which monitors are connected.

My aim is to have the janitor running at startup, with a pre-configured profile (e.g. clean old packages and empty the browser cache), much like CCleaner's /AUTO parameter on Windows.\nThe website is lacking any documentation or usage instructions, and I could not find any information on this here on AskUbuntu as well.\nI tried, naturally, to start Ubuntu Tweak from the command line, hoping additional API exists that will come through in this (allegedly) simple task.\nI only got as far as: \nubuntu-tweak -f janitor\n\nwhich is a step in the right direction, but what's still missing is a command for the clear action. Is such a command available, or is there any better way of achieving the described behavior?\n\nA: for the moment the answer is no...\nLet me expand on that statement.\nIn many ways, your question is similar to this Q&A:\n\n*\n\n*How do I create a quicklist for Ubuntu Tweak?\nUbuntu Tweak only offers (currently) a limited API call for the executable itself.\nTherefore - when trying to invoke a Ubuntu-Tweak feature when starting from startup applications or via a quick list, you can only use the command line parameters that have been made available.\nubuntu-tweak -f janitor is one such feature.  There are no command-line parameters (currently) for what you are seeking to do.\nYou can test this yourself by running ubuntu-tweak -h.  The linked answer above shows the typical result you could expect.\nSome programs - once running - expose an interface such as dbus that allows you to invoke features via an external program.  Rhythmbox is one such software with its rhythmbox-client which can be called externally.  Ubuntu-tweak unfortunately does not offer the same external interface.\n\nWhat you'll need to do is submit a patch to the author that would add a command-line parameter to do the function you are seeking.\nAlternatively - add an externally callable interface such as dbus when ubuntu-tweak is actually running.\n", "Q: How to install Canon MP610 printer on Ubuntu 12.04 x64 I'm running 64 bit Ubuntu, but my canon printer driver's only come in 32 bit.\nHow can I install a Canon MP610 in 64-bit Ubuntu?\n\nI've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Adding repository like it is written here:\nhttp://www.iheartubuntu.com/2012/02/install-canon-printer-for-ubuntu-linux.html\n\n\n*\n\n*it did NOT work; the printer was installed but every print JOB goes somewhere unknown (probably to /dev/null)\n\n\n*installing ia32-libs via 'sudo apt-get install ia32-libs'\n\n\n*\n\n*This also did NOT work (it was already installed)\n\n\n\nA: Making a wiki because it doesn't seem like Arkadius is going to adhere to the site guidelines and move the answer out of his question.\n\n\n*\n\n*Ensure you do not have any other canon drivers, either from canon it self or from other ppas by remove all other cannon PPAs you may have tried to install to fix this issue.\n\n\n*Remove any previously configured versions of your printer.\n\n\n*Remove the cnijfilter driver if it is installed:\nsudo apt-get remove cnijfilter*\n\n\n\n*Add the following repository:\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:robbiew/cups-bjnp\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install\n\n\n\n*Install cups for cannon and gutenprint:\nsudo apt-get install cups-bjnp printer-driver-gutenprint\n\n\n\n*Restart CUPS:\nsudo restart cups\n\n\n\n*Add yourself to group lp:\nsudo usermod -G lp -a your_user_name\n\n\n\n*Add the  printer:\n\n*\n\n*Click the Cog up in the right-hand corner of the screen and select Printers.\n\n*Turn on the printer and > make sure it is connected.\n\n*When the Printers windows appears, click +Add and wait a few minutes.\n\n*Your printer should appear within the configuration wizard.\n\n*Click the defaults and continue on.

Do not forget to also backup hidden dot-files in your /home to safe you personal application settings including keys.\nDo replace your drive as soon as possible. Make continous backups until you have done so. In case the operating systems got damaged by a harddisk defect (likely because of boot failure) you will have to install them rather than restore them from backups.

The LAMP installation guide on the ubuntu site is incredibly easy to follow and I have only experienced my issue this one time...\nwhen I navigate to domain/phpmyadmin I'm getting my sites homepage. My .htaccess file has ErrorDocument 404 / which is redirecting it. I'm not sure what I should check to fix this. Like I said, I've never had any problems until this installation - my .htaccess + phpmyadmin never gave me a problem before.\nI've tried reinstalling phpmyadmin using synaptic package manager, which usually fixes these weird missing file situations.\nAny suggestions? let me know if you need more info..\nThanks!\n\nA: Have you checked the Apache configuration file that defines virtual hosts?  I'm pretty sure it's normally accessed at /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default (I say pretty sure, because this is normally a link to ../sites-available/default, and sometimes people change these files around a little).\nFirst, I'd look more closely at .htaccess (something I'm not as knowledgeable about as I'd like to be).  But you might try substituting a vanilla .htaccess temporarily to see if that makes it work to confirm whether it is the culprit.  Or you can just temporarily rename it to disable it.\nIf you find this is the culprit, then disabling individual lines one at a time should narrow it down to something tangible.\nI'd next look for an entry for phpmyadmin, possibly for a \"VirtualHost\" entry for it with a Directory entry to domain.  Normally, phpmyadmin isn't in this file, though.\nI don't think there's anything about phpmyadmin itself that would cause this.

They are a massaged version of the proprietary nVidia drivers. I can say they have always worked without a problem. Just add this repository from Launchpad and install. They will also update through the Update Manager as new versions become available.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nAnother option is to open the System Settings menu. This can be found by clicking the gear and wrench icon on the launcher bar or as the first item on the top panel power button menu. On the System Settings menu there is an item called Additional Drivers. Select this item and it will perform a scan and will detect your video card. A menu will pop-up with your driver options. Here you may then select the \"Recommended\" option and click \"Activate\". \nNo matter which option you choose for installation, you will be required to restart the computer to begin using the new driver.\n", "Q: Where can I find the supported way to deploy hadoop on precise? I want to set up a small (6 node) hadoop/hive/pig cluster.\nI see the work in the juju space on charms; however, the current status of deploying a single charm per node will not work for me.\nI see ServerTeam Hadoop which talks about re-packaging the bigtop packages.\nThe cloudera CDH3 installation guide talks about Maverick and Lucid, but not precise.\nWhat am I missing?  Is there a straight forward way to deploy hadoop/hive/pig on 6 nodes that does not involve building from tarballs?\n\nA: I think there is no \"supported\" way yet (by \"supported\" i mean packages in the default repositories maintained by Canonical).\nFrom the links you provide, “Hadoop Ubuntu Packagers” team has 3 ppa's with packages to precise (dev, testing and stable). If using a PPA is an option then choose the one best fits your needs.\nCDH4 provides packages to precise (although it seems quite different from CDH3). Despite not being supported you can try to use maverick repo in precise.\nAlso Hadoop provides compiled versions of Hadoop, so you dont need to build them from source, but you probably will need to setup the init scripts and configure Hadoop manually.\nHope this helps somehow.\n", "Q: How do I sync music to my Sony Walkman (Z Series) using Rhythmbox? I have recently purchased the new Walkman Z from Sony. I can transfer music by mounting it as a drive, but I would prefer to use Rhythmbox to do so. My other Android devices and MP3 players from the past have always just shown up without any tweaking.\nUsing Nautilus to transfer the files is possible but for some reason Nautilus still makes a trash folder on removable drives. Deleting the trash folder anew is really annoying to do every time I delete music from the device.\nHow can I use Rhythmbox to transfer and remove songs instead?\n\nA: I found this really old article on how to work around the bug.\nCreating an empty file called .is_audio_player in the root of the SD card  solves the problem, I can transfer and delete files from Rhythmbox now.\n", "Q: ubuntu 12.04 live cd installation process is extremely slow It is on an older dell laptop( inspiron 1150 ) but it has 512mb ram, NVIDIA GeForce and an upgraded CPU.

I have booted this laptop in other Linux distros such as SliTaz and DSL. I suspect the problem has to do with drivers but unsure exactly what i should do.\nLaptop does not have internet access ( it's IEEE 802.11a only )\n\nA: I would suggest a different OS that is less resource hungry Xubuntu\nXubuntu 12.04 is a Long Term Support release and will be supported for three years. This contrasts with Edubuntu, Kubuntu and Ubuntu 12.04 which, while also LTS releases, will all be supported for five years.\nXubuntu 12.04 incorporates many changes including that the i386 images use a non-PAE kernel, some default shortcuts were altered and new ones added, plus there were many appearance changes, including a new logo and wallpaper. Fixes were included for Greybird, Ubiquity, Plymouth, LightDM, and Terminal themes.\nThe release shipped with the Linux v3.2.14 Linux kernel. Pavucontrol was introduced to replace xfce4-mixer as it did not support Pulseaudio. The Alacarte menu editor was used by default.\nThe minimum system requirements for this release were 512 MiB of RAM, 5 GB of hard disk space and a graphics card and monitor capable of at least 800x600 pixel resolution\nAn official derivative of Ubuntu using Xfce. Xubuntu is intended for use on less-powerful computers or those who seek a highly efficient desktop environment on faster systems, and uses mostly GTK+ applications.\n", "Q: Windows minecraft on Ubuntu I've got a Minecraft version for Windows, which runs with an .exe file. I've tried to make it run with java directly and it didn't an Ubuntu message appears \"Fatal: Read Error: Could not read or parse the JNLP file\" (Show more details), when I tried with Wine, a Wine message appears \"No JVM could be found on your system. Please define EXE4J_JAVA_HOME to point to an installed 32-bit JDK or JRE or download a JRE from www.java.com\nIs there a way I can make it run? It's all because I cannot make the mods work on my Minecraft's Linux version\nThanks.\n\nA: It should be possible to install a windows version of Java in wine, not sure if winetricks supplies it. This is according to an answer here which further refers to winehq - java \nYou can try this and see if it fixes your issue\n\nA: This is what I found: \nHow do we install Java in Wine?\nBut I don't have any problems with mods on my linux machine so I'm wondering if there could be another problem. Do you have Forge or ModLoader installed? I would make sure the JDK is fully up to date on the linux machine, Forge updated, Minecraft updated, etc. \nThe minecraft EXE is a relatively new development and everything ran off of the same .jar file previously; there really isn't a difference in the program, I believe it's something to do with your software or OS. \n", "Q: reliably restarting services using upstart or runit I want to reliably restart my app and web server processes on crash. \nIf I understand correctly, runit starts every service as a child process. If the child process crashes this sends a signal to the parent process which in turn respawns the service as a child. \nHow does this work in the case of upstart. Does it also spawn a child process like runit?\nI am considering using runit for this. Is that needed, or is upstart good enough for this ?  \nI am using nginx for my web server and gunicorn (python) for my app server.\n\nA: Upstart is perfect for it, see respawn stanza: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#respawn. Upstart is an init process, pid 1, parent of all other processes.\n", "Q: How to remove Microsoft Office icons? I know that there are countless questions about how to install office and what not. But the issue I have is now that I have installed it onto my system (and it never worked, just fyi) I am now stuck with these office icons in the unity browser. Has anyone come across this issue and how can I fix this? I imagine there are some images stored somewhere and I just have to remove them because when I select the program nothing runs.\n\n\nA: I was able to remove these pesky icons by deleting the ~/.local/share/applications/wine/Programs/Microsoft Office 2013 folder. I uninstalled Wine, PlayOnLinux, but this folder was snuggly hidden, not under .wine or .playonlinux. Found it thanks to this discussion.\n\nA: Right click on the Microsoft office icon and then select unlock from the launcher menu.\n\nA: If you did not install anything else in wine you could simply delete the .wine folder in home.\nBTW, I installed Office 2007 using winetricks and the latest version of wine from their ppa and it works.\n\nA: If you still have the installer for MS Office, try running it again (via Wine), and selecting the uninstall option.  Better yet, your version of MS Office may have an uninstaller as well.  \nSince you mentioned that it doesn't run anyway, I would say this is the best way out.\n\nA: As to getting rid of the files there in the search window, you can drag an icon off the search window onto the Desktop.  There its name will become something.desktop, and if you open gedit then you can drag the .desktop file into gedit.\nyou cannot double-click this \"untrusted launcher\" and choose to open with... or anything, so you have to drag it onto a gedit window.  Otherwise you can remove the .desktop extension and add .txt, then open it as any text file.\nOnce in gedit, look at the exec= line for the path and file name, then you can go there and sudo rm the file from MS Office in t5he terminal.  Once done, it5's gone from the search results.\nThe launcher you dragged off the search onto the Desktop \"untrusted\" because its permissions are not set  to execute.  Once that permission is set the launcher assumes the icon associated with it.\n", "Q: How to block downgrade of a package using dpkg? I want to prevent installation of lower version of the package over higher version using dpkg.\n\nA: dpkg has option --refuse-downgrade which will do just that.\n(The apt tools have a different, more complex mechanism for managing version preferences, which resides in /etc/apt/preferences and /etc/apt/preferences.d.)\n", "Q: My hard disk suddenly full I am a Ubuntu beginner and I started to use Ubuntu 12.10 beta 2 last week.\nI found that my hard disk is full.

Without futher investigation, it is nearly impossible to say what causes your disk to get full. If you get that additional info, you should post that in your question to get more precise answers.\nFor me, the downloaded packages (.deb files) are often a source of high disk usage and you can clear that using the command apt-get clean.\nAnd like the other answers state, I can't see why your disk shouldn't be mounted correctly.\n\nA: I have a few questions first. What makes you think that the disk is not mounted correctly? Is your hard disk's 240 gb or is it very different?  \nAssuming its a file or bunch of files which might have caused this, you can try du -sh / in terminal to see which folders are abnormally large and then run the command on that folder and so on to track down the offending files if any\n\nA: You can investigate the problem with the Disk Usage Analyzer. It wil show a graphical representation of the size of files and directories on your hard drive and you can quickly drill down to the problem areas.\nI see no indication that your partition is mounted incorrectly, unless you have more partitions on your hard drive that should have been mounted as well. The following command gives a list of partitions, which may help us to identify the problem:\nsudo parted /dev/sda print\n\n\nA: As pointed out by @user121884, it may be because of your .xsession-errors file or .xsession-errors-old file (mine was around 110GB!),\nwhich you have to remove from your system either through terminal sudo rm .xsession-errors  or through your file explorer and then Trash. The method worked for my linux-mint 20.04.\nOne other possible reason may be some backup service going on in background, like timeshift, which sometime bloats up the system memory. If this is the case, try to login through TTY and delete some unimportant big file. This will give you time to login into system, close timeshift backups and then safely delete any large and unwanted timeshift backups.\nIf you don't have anything critical to backup, turn off timeshift. Or you can use MEGA or Dropbox to sync your important folder to cloud.\n", "Q: Restoring rEFIt on Macbook Air My Macbook Air dual boots Mac OS X and Ubuntu Precise.  Normally when you turn it on the first thing you see is the rEFIt menu which allows you to select which OS to boot.

I've restarted it a few times and it seems that rEFIt will not show up anymore.  How can I fix this so I can boot into Mac OS X again?\n\nA: *\n\n*Hold Command-R while booting.\n\n*Quit Utilities.

In my local repository see below, I have many versions of same packages downloaded and stored in deb package directory. As Ubuntu always prefer to use the highest version, I don't need the earlier versions downloaded and used. (All are in a same folder). \nHow can I delete the earlier versions of packages from my local deb's folder ? It is not a feasible solution to delete them manually. (You can't examine the versions in thousands of files) \nAny ideas?!!\nMaybe a script that checks the version of each package keeping the newer version and deletind older ones can solve this issue.\nI am seeking for such script or if some software is founded would be great\nI have made my local repository following this how to tutorial.\n*** A local repository is an offline storage of packages already downloaded, so that you don't need to download it again) \nNote: I'm not referring to clearing the cache of downloaded packages, which can be done with apt-get clean command.\n\nA: I've deleted the old versions of same packages following this. I used the inversion of the feature of dpkg-scanpackages's multiple version scanning feature. \n\n\n*\n\n*First install dpkg-dev package\nsudo apt-get install dpkg-dev\n\n\n*Then generate a file with the name of packages (only newer will be listed) dpkg-scanpackages without the -m option. The default is without -m option. \nIf you have .deb files in a folder named deb, run the below command from the parent of this folder\ndpkg-scanpackages deb /dev/null 2>/dev/null | grep Filename: > filenames\n\nThis will create a file with name filenames which have all the .deb files' name listed in a format Filename: deb/packagename_version.deb. \nWe now have all the names of files with newest versions in a file named filenames\n\n*The task is now simple, modify the script to move all those files in another folder.\n\n\n*\n\n*First replace the Filename: with mv \nsed -i 's/Filename:/mv/' filenames\n\n\n*Now create a folder in the parent directory of deb folder. I named it newest (junk-free could be a good one ;P). \n\n*Again change the filenames file to move the .deb files in the newly created newest folder.\nsed -i 's/\\.deb/.deb newest/' filenames\n\nThis will make our filenames file a list of mv commands moving .deb files from deb directory to newest directory\n\n*Now guess what. Execute the file filenames\nsh filenames\n\n\n*The last step is delete the folder with older obsolete .deb files. Check the newest folder too as a pre-caution. \nUpdate with one liner\nAfter installing dpkg-dev packages, \ngenerate the move script with a single command, use this one by going to the parent of the .deb files' folder. \n dpkg-scanpackages deb /dev/null 2>/dev/null | grep Filename: | sed 's/Filename:/mv/;s/\\.deb/.deb newest/' > filenames\n\nThen create a folder named newest and execute the file filenames with `sh filenames* command.\n\nA: Update with one liner To Delete (not to move)\nthis one liner will delete only old versions of same packages\nrun it as root\nsudo dpkg-scanpackages /var/cache/apt/archives 2>&1 >/dev/null | grep -Po '((\\/.*?deb)(?=.*?repeat;))|used that.*?\\K(\\/.*deb)' | xargs rm\n\n\"/var/cache/apt/archives\" replace with your .deb directory\nit works very good in Ubuntu 12.10\n\nA: I had the same problem: I created a local repository using apt-mirror and this tool downloads new packages but leaves all the old packages in place. I did the following to cleanup my local mirror:\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the location of your top of your mirror (the directory where the dists and pool directory are located, in my setup /var/spool/apt-mirror/mirror/ftp.nl.debian.org/debian)\n\n*Create a list of all packages in your pool: \nfind pool -type f | sort -u > files\n\n\n*Create a list of all packages in your mirrored distribution: \ngrep \"^Filename:\" `find dists/ -name Packages`|sed \"s/^.*Filename: //\"|sort -u > packages\n\n\n*Now create a diff between the two files and convert it into a cleanup script:\ndiff files packages | sed \"/^[1-9]/d;s/^< /rm /\" > cleanup.sh\n\n\n*Execute the generated script\nMake sure you have write-permissions on the repository (or execute using sudo). Instead of removing you can also move the files to a temporary location.\nThe idea behind this is that you can remove the files that are not mentioned in one of the Packages files, as they are replaced with newer versions or are deprecated. If files are not mentioned in the Packages files they cannot be found by clients connecting to your repository.\n\nA: Nice workaround from \"Anwar\" (in the first answer)!\nOnly this line I would change:\nsed -i 's/\\.deb/.deb newest/' filenames\n\nbecause if you have a Package called: packagename.debian_123.deb your line will only replace the first \".deb\" in this line and that would look like this in the end:\npackagename.deb newest_123.deb\n\nTake this line instead, and only the last .deb in every line will be replaced:\nsed -i 's/\\(.*\\).deb/\\1.deb newest/' filenames\n\n\nA: In Thunar:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open /var/cache/apt/archives\n\n*Select files based on access time:\n\n*\n\n*click View >> View as Detailed List\n\n*click View >> Configure Columns >> enable Date Accessed\n\n*click on the Date Accessed table header, to sort the files\n\n*ctrl-click to select multiple files, shift-click to select a range of files\n\n\n*Delete the files, either via right-click >> Delete (if Thunar was opened with sufficient privileges) or:\n\n*\n\n*Right click >> choose Rename\n\n*choose Insert/Overwrite, set a custom prefix\n\n*open a terminal, sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/customprefix*.deb\n", "Q: How do I install turbo c++? I am used to Turbo C++ and I am new to Ubuntu.\nI really need Turbo C++ to get started.\nCan somebody please help me to install Turbo C++ on Ubuntu.\n\nA: The Borland Turbo C++ compiler is no longer available. On Linux, a C++ compiler is provided by the GNU Compiler Collection, which you can get by installing the 'build-essential' package. Many Ubuntu applications are actually written in C++.\nYou can edit your code with a simple editor (e.g. Gedit) and complile from the command line (command g++). Or you can install an IDE, of which there are many to choose from. I'm not a C programmer, but people seem to like Eclipse CDT (package 'eclipse-cdt').\nIf you have a body of Turbo C++ code that you want to reuse, it will probably be necessary to convert it. The Turbo C++ libraries may not be supported by GCC. I can't really help you there, but you can probably find help for specific cases on the Internet.\n\nA: Although may be possible to use Turbo C++ in Linux i think you are best served with native linux tools. In Linux the most common C/C++ compiler is gcc/g++. A basic development setup can be achieved installing build-essential package.\nIf you need an IDE to write yours C/C++ programs you have many choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*Eclipse C/C++ Dev. tools\n\n*Anjuta IDE\n\n*Code::Blocks\n\n*...\nAs i said unless you really need to use Turbo C++, give a try on those tools. You will have a much more modern development system with more features.\n\nA: Turbo C++ installation with problem solving\nI finally fixed my problem. I was trying to run \"Turbo C++\" in Ubuntu and I was facing a problem and then I solved it. Please read this to the end.\nInstallation\n-Open \"terminal\".\n\n\n*\n\n*Type sudo apt-get install dosbox to install DOSBox.\n\n*When it is installed download TC (download this Turbo C++), extract it, and paste it in home directory.\n\n\n*Type dosbox in the terminal to open it.\n\n*Create a configuration file by typing this command in the DOSBox console.\nconfig -writeconf dosbox.conf\n\n[Note: By default dosbox.conf file is created in the home directory.]\nWrite these commands in  the DOSBox console.\nmount c ~\n\nor\nmount c ~ /home/your_username/\nc:\ncd tc/bin\ntc.exeortc\n\nNow, when I tried \"tc.exe\". it was just getting closed/crashed and showing this in the terminal.\nDOSBox switched to max cycles, because of the setting: cycles=auto.   \nIf the game runs too fast try a fixed cycles amount in DOSBox's options.\n\nExit to error: DRC64:Unhandled memory reference `\n\nFix Problem shown in terminal\nI did this and everything is working fine:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open \"dosbox.conf\" present in your home folder.\n\n\n*Change things like this:\ncore=normal\ncputype=normal\ncycles=normal\n\n\nor if you want you can try \"simple\" instead of \"normal\", but \"normal\" works fine.\nThis is it.

You have to have USB legacy support activated. This option translates USB input to PS2 which the BIOS can handle. You have this option activated or else the Isku would not at all work in BIOS. But: If you wan't to access BIOS with an USB keyboard you have to wait until BIOS has activated USB Ports and with it the legacy support in the boot process.

It may be of course that the kernel is not able to resume to the point where processes are unfrozen and logging starts to occur in /var/log/pm-suspend.log on the resume.  But this is a good place to see if any specific device resumes are causing the hang.\n\nA: I had the same problem: the computer would not resume from sleep, turning on but showing a black screen (not establishing a connection to the monitor). I resolved it by turning off my bluetooth keyboard (via hardware switch on the keyboard), allowing it to automatically disconnect from the computer (~10 sec.), and only then could I sleep so that my computer would resume. I would suggest doing this with any bluetooth/wireless device you have like a mouse or keyboard.\n\nA: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man8/pm-action.8.html\nIt seems Ubuntu has two \"flavors\" of suspention: one is the normal suspend-to-ram where you do not need swap, the second is a hybrid with hibernate - the system state is written to disk before going to suspend-to-ram state.\nI guess what you are experiencing is either the hybrid suspension or even the hibernation (I couldn't make Ubuntu go into either suspend modes, only hibernate). This means you need enough swap space to write the contents of your RAM into.\nThat would usually be at least 2 GB swap for up to 4 GB of ram or at least 4 GB of swap for up to 16 GB of RAM according to Red Hat's recommendation (two years ago you'd be told to have two times the size of your RAM. If you have less than 4 GB of ram Id say take 1.5-2 times your RAM in swap.\nTo re-size swap you can use GParted from the live cd, as it can shrink and move partitions. \n", "Q: Docky often dissappears I use the latest Docky for Ubuntu 12.04 Precise.

What exactly does that mean?\nI am comparing two VPS from two provider, this one always has a large amount there (70% of the used memory) and the other VPS provider always shows 0.\n\nA: That number before cached is the amount of physical memory that is being used by cache buffers for your filesystems.  \nIt's not actually related to SWAP, despite being on the \"Swap:\" line.\nTo verify my answer with a little experiment try the following:\nRun top and note the value of 'cached'. Now run\ndd if=/dev/zero of=~/trick bs=1M count=128\n\nif you run top again you'll notice that 'cached' has grown by 128M\nNow remove the file \nrm ~/trick\n\nRun top again and you'll see 'cached' has dropped by 128M\nSo for Mem: \ntotal = used + free and \nused = <all apps> + buffers + cached \n(where buffers is basically metadata for the cached).  A bit confusing of a UI.\n\nA: the Linux kernel will use available memory for disk caching, unless it's required by a running program. \nThis is considered good; say you have 4 GB RAM, and your programs are using only 1 GB. The other 3 GB are going to waste. Despite the \"feel-good\" impression from knowing you're only using 25% of your memory, the counterpart is that the other 75% is going unused. So the kernel uses that for caching files which significantly improves performance. It's automatic; unlike older operating systems you don't need to decide how much to devote to disk cache, or manually configure it.\n\"The Linux disk cache is very unobtrusive. It uses spare memory to greatly increase disk access speeds, and without taking any memory away from applications. A fully used store of ram on Linux is efficient hardware use, not a warning sign.\"\nThis is such a common question that there's an entire website devoted to it:\nhttp://www.linuxatemyram.com\nThe website even has a way to empty the disk cache so you can then run some applications and see how much faster they are with the cache enabled :)\n", "Q: Nginx and directory list doesn't work: I have done just as in the tutorials but is simply not working:\nserver {\n    location /abc {\n        autoindex on;\n        root          /home/user/abc/;\n    }\n}\n\nIt gives me 403 Forbidden, what I'm doing wrong?\nthanks; I've tried to use a \"/\" at the end, and also without but no changes.\nWhen I go to myip/abc I hope to see some directory list but no.

I am facing some problems with current installation of Ubuntu 12.04. I'd like to go for fresh installation of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and I don't have a separate partition of Home folder.\nI have started doing simple jobs like package migration and PPA uploading etc with Ubuntu.\nMy request is, what are the files I have to backup to make sure my new installation is ready for development?\n\nA: This really goes for any coder, not just ones that work on Ubuntu or platform code, but here's what I'd go after:\nCode Files Obviously, if you're writing code, these should be backed up somewhere (and versioned). I highly recommend somewhere like bitbucket (for private repositories) or GitHub (for public/open source ones). In the future, one thing that can help with this one is to keep a separate \"data\" drive or partition, that way your data is separate from your OS (you can also use this for some programs, such as SublimeText or Eclipse, which don't actually install in the usual sense).\nScripts This should go hand-in-hand with the code files, but any scripts that you write, such as build or deployment scripts, you'll want to back up so you don't have to rewrite them.\nDatabase files Depending on the database technologies you use, you might need to backup the actual files for existing databases. For example MongoDB might store these files under /var/lib/mongodb. Alternatively, you may be able to export your database using the database's available tools.\nSettings/Config Files You've taken the time to set up Sublime/Eclipse/Bash/Vim/[insert tool here] set up just the way you want it, and you don't want to go through that again, so make sure you grab the config files that you can. There are a bunch in ~/.config and even just ~/ (ie - .bashrc), but some applications store them elsewhere, so make sure you find all the ones you use, and write down what goes where. Don't forget about your library/tool configs (ie - Apache/Nginx configs and vhost files, the global gitconfig file, etc).\nOther Support Files Do you have code templates or snippet libraries that you use? Make sure you grab them, too, so you don't have to re-find them again.\nVirtual Machines If you have any virtual machines, make sure to grab them, too, so you don't have to worry about reinstalling them as well.\nWhy not the whole home directory? Depending on what troubles you're having with your install, the issue could be with your home directory, itself. If that's the case, then backing the whole thing up and restoring it will continue your problems. However, if you know that your home directory isn't the issue, you can back it up and restore it after install.\nA list of all the applications and libraries you need Ideally, it'd be good to script this, but to start, make a list of all the programs you need to get up and running. That way, you can stick them all in an apt-get install call and have them installed all at once, and for the things not available in apt, you can go grab those while apt is doing its thing. By doing this, you get up and running as quickly as possible, without having to have a bunch of starts that are stopped because you forgot a particular library or application.\nUPDATE 2013-04-03 12:45 PM UTC/GMT: added database files as a category\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 shutdown does not finish When i shutdown my ubuntu 12,04 appears the \"shutdown screen\" and it never finish, keep shutting down... i use \"tab key\" to see the log and the last line says \"Stopping Puppet Agent\"... and it never ends (i need to either keep pushing power button or disconnect the cord)\nI Tried stopping the puppet service before shutdown but the problem persists..\nThanks in advance\n\nA: Well, after i removed several services (puppet, virtual box, etc).

Where are Clumsy Chameleon and Awesome Antelope?\n\nA: There isn't any release named with A or C for this time. But on 17.10 the name is \"A\". And also the 18.10 with \"C\" name.\nLook here for additional information: Development Code Name\n\nA: The first two release was named randomly and came from a joke. And from the third release they decided to use alphabetical order in release names. This is documented very well in the Ubuntu Wiki page\nFrom Mark Shuttleworth's writing, I'm quoting this from the wiki page:\n\nMany sensible people have wondered why we chose this naming scheme. It came about as a joke on a ferry between Circular Quay and somewhere else, in Sydney, Australia:\nlifeless: how long before we make a first release?\n     sabdfl: it would need to be punchy. six months max.\n     lifeless: six months! thats not a lot of time for polish.\n     sabdfl: so we'll have to nickname it the warty warthog release  \nlifeless is Robert Collins. sabdfl is Mark Shuttleworth.\n\nSo, the naming convention or policy wasn't fixed before the first release as you might have been assuming. That convention is later introduced and of course it is one of the greatest feature of Ubuntu OS. \n\n\n*\n\n*Read the history in Wiki page\n\n*Also read all the dashing naming suggestion given for upcoming releases\nThough they decided to use alphabetical name after Breezy, they also decided that they might avoid some letters. I think that is why there isn't a C name after Breezy. The relevant part form the Wiki page is \n\nWe might skip a few letters, and we'll have to wrap eventually\n\nAnd from 17.10 the release names will be wrapped up and will be restarted with A. So, don't forget to suggest your awesome names.\n\nA: Apparently versions that were released after 6.06 were alphabetically incremented in their alliterative letter. So chances are good that there will be an A... A... coming with version 17.10 and a C... C... coming with version 18.10. For the release history with numbering and names, see below or the List of Releases on the Ubuntu Wiki.\n 4.10 Warty Warthog     \n 5.04 Hoary Hedgehog    \n 5.10 Breezy Badger\n ...    \n 6.06 Dapper Drake      \n 6.10 Edgy Eft      \n 7.04 Feisty Fawn       \n 7.10 Gutsy Gibbon      \n 8.04 Hardy Heron       \n 8.10 Intrepid Ibex     \n 9.04 Jaunty Jackalope  \n 9.10 Karmic Koala      \n10.04 Lucid Lynx        \n10.10 Maverick Meerkat  \n11.04 Natty Narwhal\n11.10 Oneiric Ocelot\n12.04 Precise Pangolin\n12.10 Quantal Quetzal\n13.04 Raring Ringtail\n13.10 Saucy Salamander\n14.04 Trusty Tahr\n14.10 Utopic Unicorn\n15.04 Vivid Vervet\n15.10 Wily Werewolf\n16.04 Xenial Xerus\n16.10 Yakkety Yak\n17.04 Zesty Zapus\n17.10 Artful Aardvark\n18.04 Bionic Beaver\n18.10 Cosmic Cuttlefish\n...\n\n\nA: The first such release was Warty Warthog (released with \"warts and all\"), so it was certainly out of order, too, although at that time there really was no system for naming the releases.  The next release was Hoary Hedgehog (staying with the \"hog\" idea, I guess), and after that came Breezy Badger, and then Dapper Drake.  It appears the alphabetical idea came along with - or right after - Edgy Eft, so the \"A\" and \"C\" names weren't used just because the system wasn't yet in place.\nOf course, there's also no reason to think that such a naming convention should start with the beginning of the alphabet, anyway, as after Zany Zoophyte it can just wrap around; I guess the alphabet can start wherever one prefers.\n", "Q: VSFTPD installed, but I can't restart/stop it I've installed VSFTPD on my VPS running Ubuntu server 10.04.

The thing is, that after some time you've got a lot of unwanted files from the old backups bloating your backup device. Also, if you'd accidentally delete your full (first) backup file, then the differential backups would be corrupted (you wouldn't be able to restore them).\nThe thing I'm looking for is a program, that would backup files simply by copying them. It would check the backup device whether it contains the file (unchanged):\n- if yes, it should proceed to the next file (we've got current version backed up)\n- if no, it would copy the file to the backup device\n- if the device contains a file that is no longer on our disk, the program would delete it from the backup device\nIs there any such utility, that would work this way? If not, do you have any hints on how to backup fairly big amounts of data (around 20gb) quite frequently with incremental backups and not be exposed to those unwanted effects of backup size puffing up?\n\nA: rsync can do everything you described with the --delete switch.

I have a touchscreen, but the drivers are not working properly and interfere with my mouse. \nIs it possible to disable my touchscreen , so that I can work again properly?\n\nA: You can try disabling the input device with the xinput command. First see what input devices you have, just type:\nxinput\n\nAnd you should see a list like:\n$ xinput \n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Atmel Atmel maXTouch Digitizer            id=9    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ TPPS/2 IBM TrackPoint                     id=13   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad                id=12   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n...\n\nThen you can disable the input device you want with this command:\nxinput disable 9\n\nWhere 9 is the id of the device you want to disable. You can also use the device name between quotes.\nIn xinput version 1.5.99.1 , you need to do xinput set-prop 9 'Device Enabled' 0 instead.

I want to automate it i.e. by executing a shell script which will automatically add CNAME in DNS Zone, How it could be possible. \n\nA: I discovered that the only way to do it is to install our own DNS serve so that we can edit our zone file inside our server and add cnames. So, in this way we can write a shell script to automate the process of adding DNS each time we add content of a website. The best DNS server is BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) . \nHere are some useful links for BIND: \n\n\n*\n\n*Official page\n\n*Wikipedia page  \n\n*How to Configure\nHope I helped others who are looking for solution to the problem same as me.\n", "Q: How to fully utilize RAM to increase overall system performance I have a low profile machine but with a lot of fast RAM, 4 Gb, which is really an amount of memory that i probably will never use, not even an half, since i just use this machine for coding and browsing the web.\nThe HDD is really slow and so the overall performance are bad when booting, caching or starting new program, I'm wondering if Ubuntu can provide some setting or utility to solve this situation and let my system rely more on the RAM usage.\n\nA: What is RAM?\nRAM, or random access memory, is a type of storage system known as volatile storage. That is, it only holds data while it has power. In other words, any changes you make to it, if you don't write it to a persistent storage device, will be lost at any time the RAM loses power.\nWhat is a hard drive?\nHard drives, or disk drives (or hard disk drives), are a different type of storage system known as persistent storage. This means that the data stays even when deprived of power. CDs, DVDs, floppy disks, and USB thumb drives also fall under this category.\nWhat happens when I boot, write to cache, or start new programs?\nIn order to maintain your system between reboots, the OS has to write what it has in the RAM into a persistent storage device, usually the primary hard drive. Conversely, in order to restore that information, or to start applications, it has to load that data into the RAM from the storage device. This even happens with live CDs, even though everything is running in memory, it has to first read everything from the CD (or USB drive). It also happens even with the tools/ideas cauon and Ugo have suggested, because at some point or another, data has to be read from or written to a disk in order to persist between boots (specifically Preload will not improve boot time).\nIf you have fast RAM, then your bottleneck will be somewhere in the read from/write to disk process, usually either in the speed of the data connection or the speed of the drive.\nWhat can I do to improve the speed of these operations?\nTo improve the speed of all three of your mentioned operations, you'll need to do some hardware upgrading.\nGet a faster connection. Parallel ATA connections (PATA, the gray ribbon in older machines) is going to be slower than SATA connections (Serial ATA, the newer, smaller cables). If you can and haven't already, upgrade to a SATA drive. If you go the USB drive route (outlined below), then make sure you're using a USB 2.0 (or, even better, speed-wise, 3.0) drive and port. USB devices and ports will clock down to the speed of the slower thing, so even if you have a 3.0 port, if the device it 2.0, you will only get 2.0 speeds.\nGet a faster storage device. Platter-based hard drives are measured in RPMs, and generally come in three speeds - 5400 rpm, 7200 rpm, and 10k rpm. If you have a 5400 rpm drive, upgrade to at least a 7200. Additionally, Solid State drives (including USB thumb drives) are faster than platter-based drives. If you can afford it, upgrade to a solid state drive. Alternatively, you can install Ubuntu on a USB drive and run it from there (keep in mind, though, that such a set up will be limited to the speed of your USB port, so make sure you use at least a USB 2.0 port and drive).\n\nA: You should install Preload which will preload the software you use the most in your RAM (it'll learn which software to preload on its own). That's very easy to setup:\nsudo apt-get install preload\n\nYou probably don't need to touch it, but if you want you can edit the options in /etc/preload.conf\n\nA: You can add the following line to /etc/fstab to mount your /tmp directory into the RAM.\n\ntmpfs   /tmp       tmpfs   defaults,noatime,nodiratime,mode=1777   0  0\n\nThis can be done with other directories, too. E.g. when you are compiling your code you can put the folder where the object files are placed and linked into RAM.\nBut pay attention. Data in folders that are mounted this way will be lost on any case of shutdown. Keep that in mind.\nBesides from my knowledge there are many other helpful ressources available on this topic. For example this thread.\n\nA: try zram (once called compcache), it is a compressed swap in the memory!\nthe package for ubuntu 12.10 is zram-config, no need to boot.\nswapon -s will show something like:\nFilename                                Type            Size    Used    Priority\n/dev/sda2                               partition       1023860 0       -1\n/dev/sdc4                               partition       976892  0       -2\n/dev/zram0                              partition       761876  0       5\n/dev/zram1                              partition       761876  0       5\n/dev/zram2                              partition       761876  0       5\n/dev/zram3                              partition       761876  0       5\n\nI have 6GB ram and 4 core cpu, so one swap for each core using half in a total, of the ram! (for a good reason)\nRead what ppl is saying about compcache and zram!\nwell, if non zram are being used, boot or try to, IYKWYAD (if you know what you are doing), swapoff them, to see zram ones be filled and improve overall performace.\n", "Q: Installing a new theme on 12.04 How can the \"Clearlooks compact\" theme be installed on 12.04 running Unity and MyUnity?

thread  with a similar problem. You can try the fix given there by lucacerone:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*close eclipse\n  \n*open a terminal (CTRL+ALT+T)\n  \n*type: sudo apt-get --reinstall install tzdata-java\n\n", "Q: set up WLAN on a Ubuntu desktop to connect with wireless device I'm using a desktop computer with Ubuntu 12.04 OS. This PC is connected to internet and a local network which is also connected by a wifi router.\nCan I use this PC to connect to other wireless devices (via the wifi router)??\nThis is a bit tricky since it's Ubuntu\nCould anyone help me with some hints??\n\nA: YES! If other computer/devices are connected to the router...Just install Samba a network homegroup sharing utility just like the one in Windows OS. After that you have to configure the software, router and the other devices. \n\nA: http://www.howtogeek.com/116409/how-to-turn-your-ubuntu-laptop-into-a-wireless-access-point/\nHow to Turn Your Ubuntu Laptop into a Wireless Access Point\n", "Q: how to connect to a remote desktop behind a router? Here's my setup: I have a laptop that I roam around everywhere with, and I have a desktop computer at home that is connected to the web using a router with NAT.\nMy objective here is to create an SSH server which I can use for the purpose of file storage/access as well as using it as a proxy server. However, the problem is that the desktop (which i'm using as the SSH server) is on a router behind a NAT. This means I can't connect to the server from outside my home network. \nI want to be able to connect directly to my desktop from an outside network using the laptop. Here are the options I've found on the web so far:\n\n\n*\n\n*Teamviewer - I really don't want to use this, I tried it and didn't like it one bit.\n\n*Configure port forwarding on the router - Again, not an option since the router is actually operated by the ISP and they won't let me reconfigure it. \n\n*Using a program called pwnat which I found here - This seems like the most viable of all my options, but I haven't been able to figure out how to get it to work. Also, from the poor documentation, it seems to be quite a pain to use as well. \n\n*Reverse tunnel as show here - This cannot work as I don't have a \"middle\" computer\nIs there some way I can make the connection through SSH from the laptop on a regular basis? Otherwise, is there some other alternative that will let me use the desktop as a file server and proxy? \nEdit: There was another alternative provided below by ObsessiveFOSS\n\n\n*\n\n*Using the gogo6 client - Seemed like a good option, but I couldn't make it work. Possibly because my ISP/Router doesn't appear to support IPv6.\n\n\nA: You can use Gogo6 and get an IPv6 address at the same time:\nOn the server, download and install the Gogo6 client with:\nsudo apt-get install gogoc\n\nAnd get an account at http://www.gogo6.com/freenet6/registration for Freenet6.\nThen, run gksudo gedit /etc/gogoc/gogoc.conf(still on the server) and set the following settings:\nuserid=your_user_name_you_set_up_with_the_link_above\npasswd=your_password\n\nSave and reboot. You can now access your_user_id.broker.freenet6.netas long as the SSH client is set up to bind to that interface. You can just bind it to 0.0.0.0, which is the default IIRC.\nIt should allow access from IPv4 hosts, but I will check on that.\n", "Q: My ethernet is not been detected in Ubuntu 12.04 I'm very new to Ubuntu, all of a sudden my internet is not working in my Ubuntu machine.\nBut fortunately the internet is working in my Windows machine.

Thanks in advance.\n\nA: Yep... you need a driver. The best plan is to get the driver on your windows machine, then boot to linux and compile it. You can follow the steps found in this guide at the Ubuntu Forums:\n\n\n*\n\n*Download the driver and expand it into a new directory. cd to the\ntop directory in the expanded directory.\n\n*sudo make clean modules\n\n*sudo make install\n\n*Verify that a new file named r8168.ko exists in the directory\n/lib/modules/3.2.0-24-generic/kernel/drivers/net/ethernet/realtek/.\n\n*blacklist r8169.\n\n*Edit /etc/initramfs-tools/modules and add a line with \"r8168\" in it.\n\n*sudo depmod -a\n\n*sudo update-initramfs -v -u -k uname -r\n\n*Reboot\n\n\nA: Ok it seems that your network card is recognized, so it should be a problem with your network. Try those steps:\nsudo dhclient eth0\n\nCheck if you have internet now (without closing the terminal window). If it works you should create a new Wired connection in Network Manager(with Method as \"Authomatic (DHCP)\").\nIf you still dont have internet you should inspect your Windows network configuration. Probably you have a fixed IP address that you can gather from there, and supply it to Network Manager.\nEdit\nLooking at your configuration it seems your network is configured using DHCP. So, go to Network Manager, delete any Wired network you could have there, and create a new one.\n\nThen select DHCP in IPv4 tab:\n\nAfter that try to connect manually through the newly created connection. If it still don't work try to select \"Automatic (DHCP) addresses only\" (step 3) and add the information \"DNS servers\" you got in the Windows screenshot.\n\nA: This is as a bug in Ubuntu 12.0.4 (bug: #145382 | broken 70-persistent-net.rules)\nThe fix is:\n\n\n*\n\n*look into your settings what is your NIC MAC address and remember it > $MAC\n\n*nano /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules\n\n*Look up for: \n\n\nSUBSYSTEM==\"net\", DRIVERS==\"?*\", ATTRS{address}==\"$MAC\",\n  NAME=\"eth5\"\n\n\n*Rename it as NAME='eth0'\n\n*Make sure your /etc/network/interfaces is correct\n\n*Reboot\n\n", "Q: how to recover missing files on shotwell 0.12.3-0ubuntu0.1? \nPossible Duplicate:\nTool for recovering deleted data from a flash drive \n\nI recently \"imported\" some pictures from a memory card to Shotwell, but apparently I did not import them correctly, now they all appear in the Missing Files. The pictures are no longer on the memory card I imported them from. Is there a way I can recover these pictures?\n\nA: It sounds like you chose 'Import in Place' when you added the photos. For future reference, you want to choose 'Copy Photos'.  \n \nIf this assumption is correct, then you have a chance at recovering the files, as long as you haven't continued to use the memory card. There are several duplicates of this question, you are facing a simple 'recover deleted files' problem already answered here. I've used testdisk following the how-to linked from that answer and it's pretty easy. I recovered all the files no problem. TestDisk is in the Software Center, you don't need to download it from a third-party site.  \nThe only other thing to check is where you have Shotwell set to import to. In the remote chance that you did import properly, but then disconnected the destination drive, check Shotwell's preferences in Edit -> Preferences -> Library (tab) -> Library Location -> Import photos to: and make sure that is set to the Pictures directory, or some other location that is mounted. If you did a normal install of Ubuntu onto a single hard drive (this is the most common setup), then you can ignore this entire paragraph and just hit the link to the TestDisk answer in the paragraph above.

What I really like about GNOME shell is that the user can easily place different applications in different workspaces, thus giving each application the entire desktop. The pain in that is that the user has to manually switch the applications between workspaces. \nThere is an extension that forces specific applications to be opened in predesignated workspaces; for example, Firefox would start at workspace 4, Banshee at workspace 3, etc. But the drawback of that is that if the user is working in workspace one and wants to start Firefox, he/she would have 2 empty workspaces between 1 and 4. Not only that but also programs that aren't configured would still open in the current workspace. \nIs there an extension or a script that forces new applications to start in the last open workspace (the empty one), no matter how many workspaces are open?\n\nA: Check out this extension: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/16/auto-move-windows/.

With enough memory and understand that \"enough memory\"\nwill be OVER 4GB for this recipe. Have in consideration that you are\ngoing to run several high demanding processes at once, thus the\nmajority of the RAM will be consumed at the very launch.\n\n*Once you've sifted the computer with the proper pieces of software,\nadded to the latest Ubuntu OS, we need to start cooking in the next\norder:\nMake sure all your devices are well recognized in the Webcam Studio\nSoftware. This can be done by checking out how many small icons\nappears in the \"Devices section\" of Webcam Studio, see the next\nillustration:\n\nAs you can see, I have 2 live Devices, I also included several\nImages, a movie and a song by using the \"Sources/Add a folder to\nscan\" option, so that I can choose between several sources for my\ntransmission.\nOnce you have all your live devices recognized in the software, make\nsure you include everything you need for the broadcast in the\nSources section (upper left).\n\n*Next, let's reach our web based broadcast service. For this example\nI am going to use the Ustream Website and use the \"Live\" button (\"En\nVivo\" for the Spanish Version), as shown in the next screenshot:\n\n\n*When Clicking the \"Live\" button, you will be shown with the live\nbroadcaster in which you can choose the audio/video sources (by\nclicking the small gear icon), choose the \"WebcamStudio video\ndevice\" and you'll be presented with the video output of your Webcam\nStudio software. For this example I have chosen an image from my\ncollection with the internal audio source (switchable -of course-\nthrough the sound preferences). See the next full screen\nillustration:\n\n\n*And that's it. When you're ready simply hit the \"Start Broadcast\"\nbutton (Iniciar broadcast in spanish) and if you wish to keep an\nuploaded version of your broadcast hit also the \"Start recording\"\nbutton (Iniciar grabacion in spanish) and you'll be on-air.\n\n*You can have as many webcams, hi-definition cameras\n(USB/FireWire/iLink/iEEE1394,etc.), video sources (VTR, VCR, TV\nTuners, etc.) as you wish in each layout and unlimited layouts in a\nsingle project. Projects can be saved inside of the Webcam Studio so\nthat you can bring them back when needed. Of course, you will need\nto first make the devices to work in Ubuntu and be recognized by\nWebcamStudio but I am quite sure that you will find a way to calm\ndown when needed and do a great job.\n\n\nServing suggestions\nThis recipe can be served individually on owned website or via social network (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) by hitting the corresponding buttons: Twitter and Facebook will deliver the proper message to the corresponding services while hitting the link in \"Your URL\" will take you to a page, where you can gather the proper portions of code (tuneable) that can be used for the embedding of the video player in your own website. See the next screenshot for an example:\n\nWhen you finish the broadcast, you will have the recording (if you hit the proper button) to download a ready-to-use video file. Additionally you will be prompted for the ready-to-serve video link which will already be uploaded in the Ustream servers.\nALWAYS REMEMBER!!!\nTo serve it cold and in companion with your favorite drink.\nSome extra useful explanations:\n\n\n*\n\n*You will need to use the freshest and latest ingredients, specially the newest Java platform that you\ncan get in the market (I am using 7, I think).\n\n*If you can't get Java somehow, you can also run this process with\nOpenJDK or another Java Alternative (IcedTea is doing an awesome\nwork also).\n\n*If you experience some issues when launching Webcam Studio, please\nrefer to comment 16 in this link for reference on how to patch it:\nhttp://code.google.com/p/webcamstudio/issues/detail?id=75\n\n*Just for the record. For the examples and illustrations I am using\na Core i5 CPU M 450 (2.4Ghz x 4) with 4GB RAM in a 64 bit version of\nthe Precise Pangolin Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS Operating System and if you\ncheck, the average system load (lower left corner) of Webcam Studio\nis reading a 100%, which means that you will need AT MINIMUM a\ncomputer like this to run a broadcast with no problems. (Remember:\nsmall portions won't satisfy any guests, so make sure you use bigger\nportions for this recipe).\n\n*When serving, make sure you get a glass of 13 years old Havana Club\nfor me, just with mineral water, salt, lemon and two ices. :)\n\n\nGood luck!\nOh! yeah! I almost forget it...\nWindows Based OSs recipe.\nWell, this is long enough and I don't feel like writing anymore. So I will only include this recipe on demand. Please drop me a link to a place where you have the proper question in order to continue.

Ok. I have been banging my head against the wall for over a week now trying to get 3 monitors to work. \nI have:\n\n\n*\n\n*Nvidia 8600 GT 512MB PCIEx16\n\n*Nvidia GT 240 1GB PCIEx16\nThey are not running in SLI (obviously). I have tried to use everything from tutorials to a few templates, all the way up to nvidia-settings, etc etc etc.. From what I hear, Xinerama doesnt like gnome 3 because of the compositing, although I have read a lot about using Xrandr instead, and getting the compositing working, but alas, I cannot. It always either crashes X and I have to replace the xorg.conf with my backup, or it defaults to the gnome-classic desktop, and on top of that, when it does default, it keeps adding more and more panels. \nBasically, I want to be able to use all 3 monitors (yes, just like in windows) to drag and drop from different windows.\nI have xorg-edit, but I am still not too sure on how to set this up? Is there any way to:\n\nA> Get compositing working with 3 monitors, 2 nvidia cards, xinerama,\n   and gnome 3?\n\nor\n\nB>Use twinview with 3 monitors (I have heard it can be done by manually editing xorg.conf)\n\nor\n\nC>Set up Xrandr to draw all 3 monitors with compositing. \n\nor\n\nD>Use separate X for each monitor, and be able to use gnome with compositing, as well as drag between all 3\n\nor\n\nE>ANYTHING. lol. I just want this to work. \n\nAny help you can provide would be greatly appreciated. BTW, I am running an ubuntu mini install with gnome. Everything works great but this. I can run it fine with 2 monitors and compositing, but not with 3. \nAlso, what is the best GUI tool for editing xorg.conf? Im not finding anything that is up to date at all, and also is understandable by humans. haha. Im actually an engineer by trade, and have been working with computers a LONG time, but this xorg.conf stuff is really confusing the crap out of me. lol\nThanks!\n\nA: lol I love the multi-monitor questions :) If I recall correctly, TwinView is, as the name implies, for 2 monitors. The issue with XRandR is 2 fold in multi-monitor setups. It creates a large virtual display and each monitor gets a piece of it. If the total resolution is too high (2048 X 2048) it might not work... Framebuffer issues and such. You should be able to increase the fb size in xorg.conf but it comes at a performance loss iirc. Also, if the monitors are of different resolutions, there could potentially be areas that are either black, or windows fall off of your displays.\nXinerama is capable of multi-monitor setups. Let's try a mix of xinerama and TwinView first. If that fails, just comment out the TwinView lines with #. Here is an example /etc/X11/xorg.conf file. Use it as a skeleton and replace the appropriate info. Try it first with the TwinView settings as in the example.\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier     \"TriHead\"\n    Screen      0  \"Screen0\" 0 0\n    Screen      1  \"Screen1\" RightOf \"Screen0\"\n    Screen      2  \"Screen1\" RightOf \"Screen1\"\n    Option         \"Xinerama\" \"1\"                # Enable xinerama on the whole\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device0\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"Nvidia GT 240\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:1:0:0\"                   # Use lscpi | grep VGA to get the BusID\n    Screen          0                            # Note the Screen numbers\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device1\"                     # A device for each screen\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"Nvidia GT 240\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:1:0:0\"\n    Screen          1\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device2\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"Nvidia 8600 GT\"\n    BusID          \"PCI:2:0:0\"\n    Screen          2\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"Gateway HX2000\"\n    HorizSync       31.0 - 83.0\n    VertRefresh     56.0 - 76.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier     \"Monitor1\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"DELL 1907FPV\"\n    HorizSync       30.0 - 81.0\n    VertRefresh     56.0 - 76.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    Identifier     \"Monitor2\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"DELL 1907FPV\"\n    HorizSync       30.0 - 81.0\n    VertRefresh     56.0 - 76.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen0\"\n    Device         \"Device0\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor0\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"NoLogo\" \"True\"\n    Option         \"Coolbits\" \"5\"\n#    Option         \"DoubleBuffer\" \"True\"\n    Option         \"TripleBuffer\" \"True\"\n    Option         \"TwinView\" \"1\"                # Enable TwinView for the shared card\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen1\"\n    Device         \"Device1\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor1\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"TwinView\" \"1\"\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen2\"\n    Device         \"Device2\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor2\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"NoLogo\" \"True\"\n    Option         \"Coolbits\" \"5\"\n#    Option         \"DoubleBuffer\" \"True\"\n    Option         \"TripleBuffer\" \"True\"\n    Option         \"TwinView\" \"0\"                # No TwinView on this screen\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nI should also mention that the additional Options such as \"Coolsbits\" are not recommended as it enables overclocking and adjusting fan speed. \"TrippleBuffer\" is helpful when using VBlank sync.\n\nA: Well, I got this kind of working.

Also tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*To manually control the brightness by configuring the ACPI level (setting values by echo [some_value] | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/[vendor]_backlight/[some_key], without success.\n\n*Installing the Intel graphics driver, thinking it's missing.

Then again I removed the cd from drive and forcefully restarted computer and now I'm on my ubuntu desktop.\nI want your comments. Is everything well? All seems to be normal now but I still want to talk with you. :/\n\nA: Everything sounds normal to me.  While the live Linux system is shutting down, it reads off the CD for the shutdown programs, and when that's done, it prompts you to remove the disk for restart.\nSince it's a read-only system on the CD, there's no danger of shutdown while in the middle of doing something, which is probably stuff like seeing if it needs to write logfiles (it doesn't), shut down servers gracefully (who cares, they don't save their state), etc.\nSo, don't worry, be happy. :)  Enjoy your new system.\nPS.  Don't be afraid of problems; consider them to be challenges.  You'll learn a lot more that way, like it or not. :)\n\nA: Since you successfully got to your desktop, I would assume that everything is alright now. \nWhen you first removed the disk, did you wait for the computer to tell you when to remove it? Once it says you will need to restart, if you go ahead and tell it to restart, it will eventually tell you to remove the installation medium and then you are good to go. \nLike I said, since you made it to the desktop, it sounds like everything is cool.

I'm testing out Edubuntu to see if it is a better fit for our school, but I'm running up against a problem I can't resolve. \nOne of the programs we use is Carnegie Learning Online, a Java program that I've managed to get working on both Ubuntu 10.04 and 12.04. After updating Java (all distros), when you access the website a .tt applet file is downloaded. With Java installed you can select the IcedTea plugin to open it. \nOn 10.04/12.04, this then opens a new window, Java runs a setup of some sort, and then a new window with the Carnegie program opens. On Edubuntu however, once you've told IcedTea to run it....nothing happens. No errors, just nothing. I've tried this with an older update of Java as well as the newest. Any ideas?\n\nA: First check that there are no hidden error screens.  Sometimes child processes have trouble and the error or confirmation box does not get focus and it can only be found by minimising applications in the foreground.  (in one case we came across here the confirmation box was on a different workspace - see the question on running rapidminer).\nAn alternative to iced tea might be to install the Oracle java JDK.  Webupd8.org have made a ppa for it you can use:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer\n\nYou might like to look at the relevant Webupd8 page.\nIf you still have a problem it might be necessary to remove the iced tea plugin.\nEdit: I'm assuming that when you say \"updated java\" that you mean openJDK.  Oracle changed their licensing so java can no longer ship with Ubuntu, or even be in any repository; hence the need for the webupd8 PPA.\n", "Q: ubuntu-12.04.1-desktop-i386, boot error, wrong kernel \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I install 12.04 on a non-PAE CPU?

You can set it to a specified number or a name in /etc/default/grub:\nThere is an entry at the top that says GRUB_DEFAULT=0, or some other number.  Zero means the first menu entry will be the default, usually Ubuntu or whatever distro installed this grub.  You can change that number to a different one.\nYou can also set it to a specific name, so that the numerical order won't matter - but it needs to be the exact name, such as: GRUB_DEFAULT=\"Microsoft Windows XP Professional (on /dev/sda1)\"\nYou can set it so the last chosen OS becomes the default until you choose a new one, by adding this line below the GRUB_DEFAULT setting:  GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true\nFrom Grub2 - Community Ubuntu Documentation:\nSaving an OS can be achieved by running sudo grub-set-default if GRUB_DEFAULT=saved is set in /etc/default/grub. It may also be saved if GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true is also set in /etc/default/grub. In this case, the default OS remains until a new OS is manually selected from the GRUB 2 menu or the grub-set-default command is executed. \n", "Q: Touchpad not working on an Acer One 725 I installed ubuntu on a usb drive on a acer one 725, and cannot seem to be able to make the touchpad work....here is what i have\nxinpbig-marc@Big-Marc:~$ xinput  --list\n⎡ Virtual core pointer                      id=2    [master pointer  (3)]\n⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ Logitech USB Optical Mouse                id=10   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n⎜   ↳ ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad                  id=13   [slave  pointer  (2)]\n\nany can help me out....\n\nA: I installed Unity 12.04 on an Acer 725, everything worked but the touchpad.\nThis got it working.\nopen terminal:\ncd /etc/modprobe.d\ngksudo gedit options.conf\n\ntype into file:\noptions psmouse proto=imps\n\n\nin terminal:\nsudo modprobe -r psmouse\nsudo modprobe psmouse\n\nclose terminal, log out, Fn+F7 should now toggle touchpad\n\nA: got from this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2020719&page=4\nthis solution works on Mint 14 (Ubuntu 12.10, linux version 3.5.0-21.32), and also with this solution scroll can be enabled.. just create a file:\n/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-acer.conf\n\ncontaining this line:\nblacklist acer-wmi\n\nin terminal:\nsudo modprobe -r psmouse\nsudo modprobe psmouse\n\nthis solution works on 3.5.0-17.28, without needing to do steps above, just create a file:\n/etc/X11/xorg.conf \n\ncontaining:\nSection \"InputClass\"\n    Identifier \"ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad\"\n    MatchProduct \"ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad\"\n    MatchDevicePath \"/dev/input/event*\"\n    Driver \"synaptics\"\n    Option \"TapButton1\" \"1\"\n    Option \"TapButton2\" \"3\"\n    Option \"TapButton3\" \"2\"\n    Option \"VertTwoFingerScroll\" \"1\"\n    Option \"HorizTwoFingerScroll\" \"1\"\n    Option \"CoastingSpeed\" \"10\"\n    Option \"EdgeMotionMinZ\" \"30\"\n    Option \"EdgeMotionMaxZ\" \"40\"\n    Option \"EdgeMotionMinSpeed\" \"100\"\n    Option \"EdgeMotionMaxSpeed\" \"400\"\n    Option \"FingerLow\" \"9\"\n    Option \"FingerHigh\" \"12\"\n    Option \"EmulateMidButtonTime\" \"0\"\n    Option \"ClickPad\" \"True\"\n    Option \"SoftButtonAreas\" \"50% 0 82% 0 0 0 0 0\"\nEndSection\n\nthen, reboot..\n", "Q: How to restore .bashrc file?

I assume your ~/.bashrc file istoast, and you have WSL. If either of my two assumptions are incorrect stop reading; this isn't going to work for you.\n\n*\n\n*First off you are going to need, GWSL, (aka Windows Subsystem Server for Linux). The GWSL server connects Windows to the Linux distro, and gives access to the Linux file system.\nBelow is what the menu should look like when you open it up from the task-view buttons on the right side of the taskbar (assuming you have your taskbar located in its default location at the bottom of your desktop).\n\n\n\n*Just hit the Linux files button, then select the distro you are using (assuming you have more than one distro to choose from, for 99% of people this will be Ubuntu, or Debian.). If it is the first time I have used the GWSL server in a while, sometimes it will make me select from a 3 menu, where there is another Files option (it didn't pop-up for me this time, so note that its called files something).\nBelow is an image of a screenshot taken from my desktop. Your filesystem should like like this.\nIMPORTANT: Make note of the file-path in the Windows filebrowser\nNOTE: The file path should be to the distro that you deleted your ~/.bashrc file from. If it's not, you're going to be fixing (or breaking) a distro, that was never broken in the first place, and you're going to have to do this twice.\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n*I forgot the arrow on this one, but you want to open the etc folder — which is the same as the /etc/... directory when your navigating the file-system from the file-system from a native terminal using your shell, (bash in this case).\n\n\n\n*Once you pop etc open, open the folderskel. Again, this is the equivalent to etc/skel/.... This directory is copied each time a new user is added to the system, it keeps a defaultly configured ~/.bashrc file, because every user needs one, which is why you're doing this, because you no longer have one.\nDon't just double-click the /etc/skel/.bashrc file. Read step 4 first.\n\n\n*Like I said above, you should see a .bashrc file. right-click it, and open it with an editor. I like to use VS Code personally. It should pop up right as day if you followed the instructions correctly. DON'T EDIT IT, OR COPY & PASTE IT YET.\n\n\n*Go back to your Windows file-navigation window that you opened up your Linux filesystem in, and navigate back to your distros home directory, mine reads \\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu-20.04, if you use the general Ubuntu distro it should read \\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu.\nNOTE: Depending you have Windows configured the path may look different, but when you copy and past it, it should look like the paths I just posted (remember we're in Windows now, so we are using backslashes, rather than forward slashes).\nFrom your distro's base directory — which in Linux would be a simple forward slash / — open the folder home (in Linux this is /home).\nYou should see a folder with the name of your user, open it.\n\n\n*You should now be in \\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu-20.04\\home\\$YOUR_USER_NAME (obviously $YOUR_USER_NAME is not literal semantics, and should be replaced w/ \"your user name\".) I have learned over time, that sometimes these small things need to be said, for those with less experience, so I apologize to the experienced users looking for a quick solution.\nOnce you're in \\\\wsl$\\Ubuntu-20.04\\home\\$YOUR_USER_NAME right-click and hover over new in the right-click menu. It should open another menu where you can select a file type select a file type (I select text), any file works, we're going to get rid of the extension anyway.

It is much simpler than using a full bind9 server.\n\nA: Well, if the network is really simple and static, you could just modify /etc/hosts on all devices to have lines like:\n192.168.1.42  universe\n172.17.18.19  foobar\n\nIf you have too many devices or they change too often, dnsmasq (available in the repository) provides you with either a DNS server or a DHCP server, or both.

I think that the best way to fix this is through a script file, so that you don't have to enter the commands every time you want to play the game.\nI have written a script file that, among other things, will fix the Dungeon Crawl Tiles window to consume only one desktop, instead of spanning across two. You may download or view it here. \n\nA: I don't think there is any clean solution to this right now. The easiest workaround is to use xrandr and set it to only use one monitor before starting the game with:\nxrandr --output LVDS1 --off\n\nAnd when you are done with the game reenable both monitors with:\nxrandr --output LVDS1 \\\n         --mode \"1366x768\" \\\n         --panning 1366x768+1600+75 \\\n       --output VGA1 \\\n         --mode \"1600x900\" \\\n         --panning \"1600x900+0+0\"\n\nAnother alternative is to start the game in a window-mode and then remove the screen border with some hackery. I have written a tool for that, available at:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://github.com/Grumbel/fullscreen-tools\nBut it's not really end-user ready or anything. You use it like this (move you mouse pointer over the game window before the 2 seconds ran out):\nsleep 2 && ./windowtool.py -keep-above 1 --decorations 0 -m 1366,0 ACTIVE\n\nIf the game doesn't provide a resolution that fits your desktop, you can use xrandr to set your monitor to a resolution that fits the game.\n", "Q: Should I dual boot or get rid of Windows and just run Ubuntu? For the last 3 years my laptop has been dual boot Ubuntu and Windows Vista. I hardly ever go into Windows at all. I am going to replace my laptop next month with a Dell XPS 13. The SSD is only 128GB which isn't a huge amount of space, especially if partitioning for dual boot. Is there any reason I should keep Windows at all, or should I just get rid of it and have it dedicated to Ubuntu? \n\nA: If you need Windows for anything, like Netflix streaming, iTunes, etc, you can either keep it, but with a small partition, or better yet - assuming you have a bootable Windows CD, use VirtualBox to create a Windows VM so you don't even need to leave Ubuntu to run the windows programs.  I use this method, and it works well, although I use it with XP, which is probably less resource intensive.\nIf you're keeping your old laptop, you could just use that for your emergency Windows usage.\n", "Q: cannot delete IPv6 default gateway The commands below should be pretty self-explanatory.

Be aware that if you delete it then it will probably come back on its own within 5 minutes when the router sends out another advertisement, as it will normally do periodically. If you don't want your machine to listen to router advertisements then what you probably want is to do this:\necho 0 >/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/eth1/accept_ra\n\nIf you do that, you don't even have to bother removing it manually: it will disappear within a few minutes when it expires naturally.\nNevertheless, if you want to, you can remove it manually. It's just that it looks like the route command isn't able to do it. Use the ip command instead:\nip route del ::/0 via fe80::20c:29ff:fe87:f9e7 dev eth1\n\nIn fact, if you are working only under Linux then I recommend that you always use the ip command as a modern replacement for all of the following commands: route, ifconfig, and netstat. Its syntax is much easier to handle that any of those other commands, it unifies them all together, and there are functions (like ip rule and ip tunnel) that are only available through it.\n", "Q: Literally 50 SH Zombie processes is system monitor This bothers me now for a while: I have a huge list of Zombie processes whenever my system runs for a while as you can see in my gnome-system monitor.

First of all I searched for the command to see my disk space... I discovered my drive was full, so after an LS I realise the \"Documents\" folder... I cd there and some of the things from windows that Ubuntu was trying to import were there... So I deleted the whole folder and rebooted. That fixed my issue!

If you want to use this, it tells you how at the top of fstab, but at a terminal, you enter the command sudo blkid to get a list of UUIDs, which you can then cut and paste into fstab.\nMy NTFS drive is set with these options; I am the owner:\n#sdax good idea to add comment here\nUUID=C61460BE1460B2DB  /mnt/foldername  ntfs-3g auto,users,uid=yourID,gid=yourID,utf8,dmask=002,fmask=113  0  0\n\nI mount it in /mnt/foldername, and yourID should be changed to your login name.

If there are no problems, I test to see if the results are what I want.  If not, I unmount that directory only, using sudo umount /path/mountname, make another edit to fstab, save, and repeat until it's working.\nIf there is a syntax error, then before closing the file, I usually comment out the entry if I can't get it fixed, and try again later.\n", "Q: No wifi connection with Atheros wifi card ar2143, gui only works in wired connection So I've been having multiple issues installing both 12.04 and natty narwhal 11.04.\nI installed from a usb drive both times exactly as ubuntu.com said to onto a custom build desktop with a Atheros ar2143 pci wireless card.

I tried the player preview with my my existing nomachine nx server setup, without upgrading the nx server.  It seems to work.  I am not sure if it is disabling the render extension, but at least there is no major slow down like before.\nThere are more artefacts on screen when switching window or drag-and-dropping, but they go away, so so far is pretty useful.\n[/EDIT]\n\n[Edit] I later realized my issue only occurs when I am using NX to remote access my machine.  Therefore I edited the title and description.  \nI have also found the temp solution, which is to \"disable render extension\" in the custom display settings.  But doing so makes the NX experience very slow laggy, and not that nice to look at.\n[/EDIT]\nI did a fresh install on a new computer, and was trying to setup my fonts.\nWhen I log in remotely via NX, my the text are missing on all gtk based interfaces.\nThat means most menues (except for unity), right click menues, applications themselves, terminal, and so on.\nAbout the only thing unaffected is firefox.  all the texts are showing just fine for firefox.  So that probably already says something about text permissions.\nI went to check if my fonts have the correct permissions and they do.\nI removed my custom settings from /etc/fonts/config.d, and still the texts are missing.\nThere is a work around by using \"disable render extension\" in the custom display settings.\nHow do I fix this issue permanently? \n\nA: I have found solution for identical problem in Arch forums.\nYou need to downgrade libcairo2 to 1.10 version (I have downloaded it from precise-updates repo - http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise-updates) and make order in resulting dependency mess.\nI had to downgrade as well following packages: libcairo2:i386 (my system is amd64, but e.g. acroread depends on the 32-bit version of the library), libpoppler-glib8, and poppler-utils. The last two downgrades demanded installation of libpoppler19. All the poppler packages was taken from precise repos:\nhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/precise\nOf course it is not a permanent solution, but everything works fine. I'm afraid we need to wait for some patch for the cairo library.\n", "Q: Issues with TDAmeritrade thinkorswim I installed thinkorswim (\"ToS\") to Ubuntu 10.04LTS on a 64-bit AMD setup in January and used it without issues through August 3. The system was continually kept updated all that time.\nIn mid-August I attempted to install ToS on a different 64-bit AMD computer under a fresh 12.04 install (with updates).  Although ToS installed and ran, it crashed the system.  The only way to recover is to remove the battery.  Installing Sun Java 6u35 solved the problem (see post \"Thinkorswim crashes 12.04\"). ToS will now install and run, but the kill button causes the ToS icon to disappear and the only way (that I know of) to restart ToS is to reinstall (run the ToS installer script).  Minimizing also causes problems. The 12.04 update of October 10 has only made the problem worse (kill/minimize/maximize buttons disappear, buttons respond only after very long delay).\nAlso, ToS will no longer install to a fresh 10.04LTS install. (first observed in mid- to late September on a third 64-bit AMD setup).  The script runs, but the Java installer fails, emitting a message saying that it cannot connect to an X server.  Attempt to install to openSuSE 12.2 fails also.  Installing Sun Java 6 makes no difference.\n\nA: Installing is a matter of making sure permissions are set correctly, since the ToS installer doesn't.  If you install to your home directory and allow write and execute permissions in the ~/thinkTDA directory, you should be set.  Ubuntu may ask to confirm ToS as trusted.  Once you confirm that it is, the ToS icon will display on the desktop and/or launchpad.\nI have now successfully installed and am using ToS on Ubuntu 12.04 and also Linux Mint 13 \"Maya\" and Linux Mint 14 \"Nadia\".  It won't install on openSUSE 12.1.  ToS runs just fine with each native openJDK (both 6 and 7), though pulseaudio sometimes causes exception errors, which require ToS to be restarted.\nIf ToS requests to be restarted, do so.  If you continue, it will SEGFAULT and you will probably have to remove and then restore power to recover.\n\nA: OK, so it isn't nice to \"respond\" to one's own posts.  But, here are the solutions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Make sure the subdirectory to which ToS installs (and all its files and lower lever subdirectories) are read-write and execution enabled.\n\n*Unless you want to install Oracle's Java 6 and link the ToS installer to it, disable the ToS splash screen.  If you can't do that, call Tech Services and ask them to disable it for your account.  Although I have experienced some crashes over the past five months, ToS has been running well for me with the splash screen disabled under Ubuntu 12.04 and the openjdk that comes with it.\n", "Q: How do I choose which way to enable/disable, start/stop, or check the status of a service? If I want to start a system installed service, I can do:\n# /etc/init.d/some-svc start\n# initctl start some-svc\n# service some-svc start\n# start some-svc\n\nIf I want to disable a service from running at boot, I can do:\n# rm /etc/rc2.d/S99some-svc\n# update-rc.d some-svc disable\n# mv /etc/init/some-svc.conf /etc/init/some-svc.conf.disabled\n\nThen there are similarly various things I can do to enable services for starting at boot, and so on.\nI'm aware of the fact that upstart is a (relatively) new thing, and I know about how SysV init used to work, and I'm vaguely aware of a bunch of D-Bus nonsense, but what I don't know is how one is actually intended to interface with this stuff.  For example, I don't know how to easily determine whether a service is an Upstart job or a legacy SysV thing, without actually reading through the source of its shell scripts extensively.\nSo: if I want to start or stop a service, either at the moment or persistently, which of these tools should I use, and why?  If the answer depends on some attribute (like \"this service supports upstart\") then how do I quickly and easily learn about that attribute of an installed package?\nRelatedly, are there any user interface tools which can safely and correctly interact with the modern service infrastructure (upstart, and/or whatever its sysv compatibility is)?  For example, could I reliably use sysv-rc-conf to determine which services should start?\n\nA: Functionally, there is no difference between any of these invocation methods.\nstart and stop are symbolic links to initctl.  service is a shell script that determines whether to execute the init script or use initctl.\nThe simplest way to see what is an Upstart job is to take a look at /etc/init/.  Everything in there is an Upstart job.  If you ls -l /etc/init.d/ you'll see every service and system task.  The SysV init jobs will be real files, while the Upstart jobs will be symlinks to /lib/init/upstart-job which will properly invoke the Upstart job.\nIn other words, you can also invoke Upstart jobs by calling, for example, /etc/init.d/apport restart, though the output will suggest using service, start, or stop instead.\nSo, in practice it makes no difference (yet!).  But if I were scripting something, I would certainly use service, start, or stop as there is almost no chance that will deprecated, whereas calling services through /etc/init.d/ could go away down the road (though probably not any time soon).\nA note on disabling services:  renaming the .conf file works, but I don't recommend it.  You might disable a service that way, but if there is a package upgrade available, dpkg will copy down a fresh copy of the Upstart job and without intending it, your service is enabled again.  The correct way to disable an Upstart job is to use a .override file which leaves the original job intact.\nFor example, to disable apport, simply create a file called /etc/init/apport.override that contains the word \"manual\".\n# echo \"manual\" > /etc/init/apport.override\nPersonally, I would avoid using sysv-rc-conf.  It may be safe enough to use it to modify SysV jobs, but I'm not sure; it doesn't seem to support Upstart jobs, and there's no way to tell form the interface which is which.  I would stick with update-rc.d for managing SysV scripts.\nFor more Upstart information see:\n\n\n*\n\n*The Upstart Cookbook: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/\n\n*The command man 5 init: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man5/init.5.html\n", "Q: Show image tags of flac on Nautilus When I was on Arch Linux, using gnome-shell, nautilus was able to show all images tagged on my music files using Easytag as thumbnails.

It also adds an entry to the boot.ini file so that when you boot Windows you have the option of either booting Windows or Ubuntu (Both of which physically exist on the Windows partition, but are logically separate).

The instructions are for gconf though, the correct command for the newer dconf should be:\ndconf write /org/gnome/sound-juicer/paranoia \"['disable']\"\n\nto reset just run: \ndconf reset /org/gnome/sound-juicer/paranoia\n\nThe article also notes that there should be an option to enable or disable to use error correction for extracting audio CDs in the KDE control center, where enabling error correction will disable paranoia mode and speed up extraction.\ncdparanoia itself can be used from the terminal and lists options like --disable-paranoia and --disable-extra-paranoia on its manpage which might also be handy if you can figure out a way to pass these options through the GUI application you are using, but as I said, ideally you want to have accurate results.\n", "Q: Unable to enable wireless on a Vostro 2520 I have a Vostro 2520 and not sure how to enable wireless on my machine.

Now on Desktop Contribute Page, I can donate only using PayPal. Will I be able to donate in the future, using, for example, VISA credit card?\n\nA: You can indeed donate with your credit card with Paypal, so that might have been a bad example.\nThe ability to use Paypal gives you a range of options if you have a Paypal account, including credit from items that you sell (such as Ebay items) and even linked bank accounts.  It's one of the more secure ways to do business online because only Paypal gets to see your card or account details; it significantly reduces the risk.\nIf you are looking for other financial ways to support Ubuntu and Canonical, you might like to have a look at some of the great Ubuntu merchandise available:\nhttps://shop.canonical.com/ \n\nA: We definitely will add other ways to contribute in the future, for this release we only had time to integrate one system and there was an existing mechanism that used to be in our /community section that used PayPal and had an account ready to go, so it was, by far easiest to just use that initially. \nAs other have mentioned, you can just use use a credit card on PayPal, you don't need to setup an account.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.x on HP Pavilion g6-1d21dx What would it take to ensure that Ubuntu 12.x is supported seamlessly on \n\nHP Pavilion g6-1d21dx with AMD A6 APU and Radeon HD 6520G\n\n\nA: Why not download a liveCD and see how it handles? That's really one of the easiest ways to find out.\nThat said, generally speaking, the only issue I've ever run into when it comes to compatibility/support is in the graphics cards. I've found driver support for cutting-edge ATI/AMD video cards to be sketchy, but that's been a while (I generally use Nvidia cards, because I'm pragmatic, and I've had good experiences with their proprietary drivers). However, a quick Google search for the card in your laptop brings up this chart, which suggests that it shouldn't be an issue, just make sure you keep your drivers up to date.\nAlso, generally speaking, the most recent versions of Ubuntu are widely supported. At this point, things have matured to the point that most systems are supported out of the box, or with just a little bit of configuring. So you're pretty often in the clear. As I said earlier, though, when in doubt, toss in a live CD and see how it handles (keeping in mind, of course, that the live CD will be slower than an installed copy).\n", "Q: How can I play different sounds each time I startup? I have read questions on Changing startup sound in Ubuntu and Changing startup music in Ubuntu.\nI understand how to rename 'desktop-login.ogg' and copy the sound I want as 'desktop-login.ogg'.  \nMy question is -is there a way I can play different sounds (i.e. choose a random file from a set of files in a defined music folder) each time I login?\nIt may sound silly, but if possible I would like to play different sounds.\nI am guessing that this may be perhaps possible by running some kind of script which replaces/renames the desktop-login.ogg file each time I shutdown, so that a new file is ready to be played on the next startup.  But I don't know how to copy a new file from a particular folder to desktop-login.ogg upon each shutdown, nor do I know where the script should reside.\nI would appreciate it if someone could tell me how to do it, or if there is an easier way of doing this.\nThank you\n\nA: Assuming you want a music file to play from a defined folder of files, this is one way to go (open a terminal to execute the commands):\n\n\n*\n\n*Choose the music player:\nI am suggesting vlc but other choices like mplayer also work.

I think that the time is ripe to have my whole Ubuntu synchronized just as my Dropbox folder is.\nGiven that we are always talking about files and directories, what's the difference between my Documents folder and my /usr system directory? Almost none, except for their location.\nIn fact, I think that there is just one big issue that prevents people to have their beloved installations mirrored wherever they go: symlinks.\nDropbox, Google Drive, Ubuntu One, Sugarsync, Skydrive, none of these services support symlinking. This means that if I push a symlink in one of the synced folders, locally the symlink is kept as is, but remotely (in the cloud or on the other synced machines) the symlink is resolved to the actual file that was originally pointed to.\nThis completely disrupts Linux installations, thus these services can't be used for this purpose.\nSo the question is: Does anybody knows a way to achieve a completely synchronized Ubuntu, always synchronized with a remote running copy, but still locally stored on both disks?\nMy best guess is that I could use NFS. But the main difference between Dropbox and NFS is that NFS is a remote filesystem that always forces to remotely access the files, while Dropbox pushes modifications to local filesystems (and thus would perform better). I've also heard about NFS caching. Does anybody knows if this solution could approximate Dropbox in this sense?\nP.s. I know that /boot, /dev, /proc, /run, /tmp and device-specific mount points in /mnt and /media will have to be left out the sync mechanism. What I'm interested in is the principle. Can this be done with reasonable performance, having reasonable resources (e.g. ~ 1Mbps upload bandwidth and a public IP address)?\n\nA: http://www.howtoforge.com/setting-up-unison-file-synchronization-between-two-servers-on-ubuntu-11.10\nThis tutorial shows how to set up file synchronization between two Ubuntu 11.10 servers with Unison. Unison is a file-synchronization tool similar to rsync, but the big difference is that it tracks/synchronizes changes in both directions, i.e., files changed on server1 will be replicated to server2 and vice versa.\n\nA: My inclination is that you are opening a bit of a pandora's box here.\n\n\n*\n\n*How do you deal with different architectures? Some parts of the filesystem consistently include the architecture as part of the path (/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu and friends), but I don't think this applies everywhere, and in any case you then have to determine which symlinks (and hardlinks) should be copied, and which are architecture specific.\n\n*How do you detect when significant files are changed? Should a program be restarted if the binary is replaced, or configuration files updated? Some will detect such changes with inotify, some not. If you are just synchronising files while the system is running, it is hard to know what running processes might be affected. (You could look in the apt file lists, or at open file descriptors, but there will still be edge cases). (Consider what happens if your sync mechanism replaced libc or something similar).\nI am inclined to think remote management (eg, using puppet or Ubuntu's apt synchronisation mechanism) is more appropriate than continuous synchronisation of the whole machine image.\nYou should probably include /var in files not to sync (merged logs from multiple systems seems to make little sense).\n", "Q: sync music with a iPhone 4 iOS 6 Is there any way to sync an iPhone iOS 6 with my PC?

I don't think you can \"sync\" it (as in downloading music FROM the phone), but you can definitely put transfer music from any Linux computer onto an iPhone 4s. \nThe app is called \"EZMP3 Player. It uses a web interface so you transfer files over the network. Once you download the app it provides you with a wi-fi and 3G IP address. You then point your browser on your computer at it and you will be presented with a page that you can select audio files to transfer to your phone.\nYou have to use the app to play the music but the player is fully featured (it plays music with the screen locked, you can skip tracks, etc..).\nThis is the only feasible solution that worked for me ( after spending days messing with Windows on VirtualBox, RhythmBox, Amarog, GPodder, etc..). \nI have an Ubuntu 14.04 box.\n", "Q: How to install multiple versions of XAMPP? I'm having trouble installing multiple versions of XAMPP on my machine. I am currently using version 1.7.7 and installed it in /opt/lampp, but I also need to install the previous version which is version 1.7.1. So I downloaded and installed version 1.7.1 in /opt/lampp2. \nBut when I run /opt/lampp2/lampp startcommand to start 1.7.1 version, why does XAMPP show that the version that is currently running is 1.7.7, when it should be  1.7.1?\n\nA: The solution is have separate directories and create a sym link to /opt/lampp\nKeep 1.7.7 as /opt/lampp.1_7_7 and 1.7.1 as /opt/lampp.1_7_1 you can create a sym link to /opt/lampp. Based on the version choice you can change the sym link.\nBut the pain is if you have to switch versions you have delete the link and recreate a new one. So to avoid this, I found a script that can do the job.\nRefer to this article (dead link, web.archive.org backup) to create the sym link \nScript  can help you to:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*gives a choice of available versions of XAMPP (based on folder names\n  containing them, based on the pattern shown above),\n  \n*stops the XAMPP\n  server processes,\n  \n*deletes the existing lampp soft link,\n  \n*creates a new\n  soft link pointing at the folder containing the the chosen version of\n  XAMPP.\n  \n  \n  Source\n\n\nA: Follow the idea to create a link, I try to make this works.\nRemember that I am not a pro, I was looking for a solution and make this script to my self and share with you. \nJust to future questions if you want to install 2 versions of xampp on Linux you have to install: Example:\nxampp php5 on /opt/lampp  then rename it to /opt/lampp5, then do the same with the php7 bin installer (or tar) and rename it to /opt/lampp7.\nthen copy this code into a new script.sh file, make it writable chmod +x script.sh, then run it $ ./script.sh or $ ./script.sh 5 start\nhere is the code example running fine on ubuntu 16.04, its just a simple script to make it work on this kind of problem, since on windows we can do it at the installation steps.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nLAMPP_VERSION=$1\nLAMPP_ACTION=$2\n\nLAMPP=\"/opt/lampp\"\nXAMPP=$LAMPP\"/xampp\"\n\nfunction stopall {\n    sudo $XAMPP stopapache\n    sudo $XAMPP stopmysql\n}\n\nfunction startall {\n    sudo $XAMPP startapache\n    sudo $XAMPP startmysql\n}\n\nfunction stopmysql {\n    sudo $XAMPP stopmysql\n}\n\nfunction stopapache {\n    sudo $XAMPP stopapache\n}\n\nfunction startmysql {\n    sudo $XAMPP startmysql\n}\n\nfunction startapache {\n    sudo $XAMPP startapache\n}\n\nfunction checklampplink {\n\n    # check if exist a link and delete it\n    if [[ -L \"$LAMPP\" && -d \"$LAMPP\" ]]\n        then\n            echo \"$LAMPP is a symlink to a directory: try DELETE!\"\n            sudo rm -f $LAMPP\n        else\n            echo \"NO $LAMPP LINK WAS FOUND!\"\n    fi\n\n    # create a new link\n    echo \"try to create LAMPP link ...\"\n    cd /opt\n    ln -s \"$LAMPP$LAMPP_VERSION\" \"lampp\"\n\n    ## check if is created\n    if [[ -L \"$LAMPP\" && -d \"$LAMPP\" ]];\n        then\n            echo $LAMPP \"created!\"\n        else\n            echo \"LINK not created! exit 1\"\n            exit 1\n    fi\n}\n\nfunction checkservices {\n\n    # check if services exists and try to stop property\n    PIDS_MYSQL=$(ps -C mysqld -C mysqld_safe -o pid=)\n    PIDS_APACHE=$(ps -C /opt/lampp/bin/ -o pid=)\n\n    if [ -n $PIDS_MYSQL ];\n        then\n            stopmysql\n        else\n            echo \"NO MYSQL TO KILL\"\n    fi\n    if [ -n \"$PIDS_APACHE\" ];\n        then\n            stopapache\n        else\n            echo \"NO APACHE TO KILL\"\n    fi\n\n}\n\n### begin ###\n\n\n\n####\n# get an action\nif [ -z $LAMPP_ACTION ];\n    then\n        echo\n        echo \"ACTION: ( start | stop | restart)?\"\n        read LAMPP_ACTION\n    else\n        echo \"ACTION SET TO: \"$LAMPP_ACTION\nfi\n# if action is stop exit\nif [ \"$LAMPP_ACTION\" == \"stop\" ];\n    then\n        stopall\n        exit 0\nfi\n\n####\n# get a version\nif [ -z $LAMPP_VERSION ];\n    then\n        echo\n        echo \"VERSION: ( 5 | 7 )? \"\n        read LAMPP_VERSION\n     else\n        echo \"VERSION SET TO: \" $LAMPP_VERSION\nfi\nif [[ \"$LAMPP_VERSION\" = \"5\" || \"$LAMPP_VERSION\" = \"7\" ]];\n    then\n        echo \"GOOD version continue ...\"\n    else\n        echo \"Wrong version exit 1\"\n        exit 1\nfi\n\n## if action is start or restart do the same\ncheckservices\n\n# check folder link\nchecklampplink\n\necho\n\necho \"Select an option to START:\"\necho \"1) ALL current installed services on xampp\"\necho \"2) Apache and Mysql - phpmyadmin\"\necho\necho \"Type enter to start option default ( 1 ) \"\nread USER_START\necho\necho \"Starting services ...\"\necho\n\nif [ -z $USER_START ];\n    then\n        startapache\n        startmysql\n     else\n        if [ \"$USER_START\" = \"1\" ];\n            then\n                startall\n            else\n                startapache\n                startmysql\n        fi\nfi\n\necho \"Done\";\nexit 0\n\nif this code have any syntax problem, sorry I just paste here.\ngood luck!\n", "Q: Ubuntu Live CD: How to switch user on LiveCD to \"root\" I have created my customized live CD by following the instructions @ Ubuntu Forum Thread 688872\nThe Live CD gets created fine and it is able to bootup as well. I see my customized setting in place.\nI created the Live CD using Ubuntu 10.04 Server edition. \nMy issue is, when the system boots up with the live CD, it logs in automatically as \"ubuntu\" user. I want the system to login as \"root\". Because I will be running quite a few perl automation script off of the live CD and I need to have root privileges.\nNow, i know the \"sudo\" way of doing it, But I am least bothered about the security aspect and want my system to switch to \"root\" user the moment it boots up.\nIs there a hack to achieve the same?\nUPDATE: If you cant resist to down vote my question, then please free to do so but do me a favor and let me know why you are down voting by dropping a comment.\n\nA: The live CD will forget everything you did during your session, so I'd recommend booting from a USB key with a persistent session. Root has no password in live session, so in the CLI, if you do sudo su, it'll just go to root, and not ask for a password. You could easily make a bash script to go to root and then run your perl scripts.\nBy default root will timeout after 15 minutes, but you can change that, see this page.\n\nA: Hmm... not sure if this exactly relates, but as I described in How is ubuntu live user graphical session (startx) started up in a LiveCD? - if I start with a Mini remix (which ends with text/console login for the live user ubuntu); and then I configure startup of X (or the desktop environment) through /etc/rc.local - then the desktop environment is seemingly started under the root user. Unfortunately, I do not know how to switch to the root user already at login, so that the text mode console starts up as root as well...\n", "Q: Ubuntu starts a bit unexpectedly When I first installed Ubuntu 20 days ago, it started like a purple screen appears with Ubuntu written and loading points and then the login screen. But now when it starts, it is like a purple screen appears and after 2 seconds it goes off and again it appears with Ubuntu written and loading points. Is this normal behavior?\nThis time when I installed Ubuntu I removed CD from the drive before restarting. I didn't let Ubuntu to first restart and then remove CD. \nIs that behavior related to this happening? This CD thing I've explained here. Please explain me.\n\nA: This is not a problem at all. My Ubuntu starts in blank and at the final stage the spash is shown and then I presented with the Login screen. So, if you aren't experiencing other problem, I would suggest you to ignore this issue. \n\nThis time when I installed ubuntu I removed CD from the drive before restarting. I didn't let Ubuntu to first restart and then remove CD\n\nActually you need to remove Ubuntu CD before restarting, i.e after clicking the restart button (after installation is finished) you will be asked to remove the CD. And technically speaking, there is no harm in removing the CD if your installation says, it finished with success. So, no need to worry about it. \n\nA: Dont fix it if it ain't broken.\nSo if it starts without giving you trouble and works without an issue, then dont let that purple screen bother you. This is not related to you removing the CD and if the Ubuntu setup said that it finished with success then it doesnt make a difference whether you remove the CD before or after restart.\n", "Q: Linux ps aux results - wierd processes of late ive noticed multiple processes that arise looking like this.

A server for hosting games.\nIf you didn't install it, somebody has hacked your server. They are running games off your hosting, using your CPU allotment and bandwidth. Take a backup immediately and talk to your host about fixing this (changing your FTP password may not be enough if they broke in via a dodgy script you're hosting).\nBefore you restore a backup, make sure as far as you can that everything is updated for the same reason as above. You don't want to let these people back in.\nEdit: You might want to be more forensic about this. The person who launched the games appears to have SSHed in at some point (to start the screen process and then hlds) so see if they're still active in a session by running who. If you can see somebody there with an IP not yours, consider talking to your local law enforcement.\nDo this after making a backup but before you tell the host. The police will need logs and maybe access - they'll get neither if the host has already nuked everything and backups may not be substantial enough evidence.\nBe aware that you may have obligations to close the hole ASAP if you're under contract with the host and/or third parties (PCI-DSS boards) so make sure you're legally able to play the waiting game before you consider it.\nIf you find an IP address of an attacking party, and you have other logs (web logs, etc) scan those for their IP. You might get really lucky and find the point of intrusion. It's very rare you'll ever get that lucky but every so often when the stars line up and you get a really lazy script kiddie :)\n", "Q: Automatic Hard Drive Access I run QBittorrent for torrenting on Ubuntu, and I have it set to drop downloads in the same hard drive, but on a different partition from what the OS runs on. Before I'm able to start downloading, I have to manually navigate to the file path of the hard drive, as if the system has no access to it until I manually go and visit it. \nWhile I CAN manually access the hard drive prior to opening the program, it's extremely annoying to get 20 errors flashing when I forget to.\nIs there a way to over ride this other than installing to a different location? I have my partitions setup in a way that it would be difficult to do it any other way (windows is on my other internal).\n\nA: You need to add your partition to the /etc/fstab file so that it's automatically mounted. Extensive documentation is available on the net on how to add a partition to fstab so you should be able to do it easily.\nCheers,\n\nA: I think automouting the disk partition at boot time can solve your issue. You will need to edit /etc/fstab file and enable automount for the specific drive there. There is a good tutorial for automounting here http://www.webupd8.org/2011/11/how-to-mount-partitions-automatically.html.\n\nA: You must mount permanently the partition. \nHere in Ubuntu community we have a very good documentation and a wiki page. \nFirst read Introduction to Fstab so you can understand better what you will do \nand then \nread automatically mount partitions to see how you can mount permanently your partition. \nThanks\n", "Q: What is a simple, free SOAP client (GUI)?

If you want to monitor all what users run, then no, this is not easily possible. There is an administrative suite of programs called bos which can be used to monitor all running processes.\nIf, however, you just want to store all commands that you type, then yes, this is being done for you by bash. Bash stores a command history in ~/.bash_history.  By default, however, only when a shell exits the command history is written. Read this web page if you want to customize it such that most of your history is saved.\n\nA: As an alternative to using bash_history, to capture every command entered in the shell by yourself and save it to file you could use something like the trap command in a script or function and place that code in .bashrc.\nFortunately,  exactly the script you want was provided by Richard Hansen a while ago in this answer, and his script copies every command entered into bash  and sends them (with a timestamp) to a file called .command_log by default. Once you have placed his script into your .bashrc and have launched terminal, Richard's script writes the commands to .command_log as soon as they are executed, unlike the bash_history feature, which only writes to the file after the terminal is closed. \nRichard's script will record your commands like this in .command_log (although you will be using different commands to me):\n2012-10-02T18:02:11+0100 /dev/pts/2 gksudo truecrypt\n2012-10-02T21:52:03+0100 /dev/pts/2 xrandr -s 1280x1024\n2012-10-03T00:16:52+0100 /dev/pts/2 mount\n2012-10-03T00:17:12+0100 /dev/pts/2 udisks --unmount /dev/sdb1\n2012-10-03T00:17:46+0100 /dev/pts/2 udisks --detach /dev/sdb\n\nI have been using it for a while and find that Richard's script is very useful; you can even grep the .command_log and search for anything you want:\ngrep -i udisks .command_log \n\nSo, I think this is probably what you want if you need to record every single thing typed into bash; I find it incredibly useful.\n\nA: If you want a entire session logged (ie. both commands typed AND results from those commands) use: \nscript\nWithout arguments, it will save the results to a file in the current directory called \"typescript\".  \nscript bogus.txt will save to \"bogus.txt\" \nSee man page for complete list of commands \nman script\n", "Q: How can I install Uplay on ubuntu?

This \"flicker\" refreshes every few seconds and looks very unprofessional when starting up around other users. \nDoes anyone know what's happening here?\n\nA: i also have the same problem over the past 2 weeks, installing burg in the  place of grub2 will help you out, here is a link about burg along with install and use instructions\n", "Q: System doesn't boot when ubuntu is installed on an SSD I've recently discovered Ubuntu and decided to give it a try. \nI am using a Samsung Series 5 p530u3c-ad1 which comes with a 24gb SSD and a ~500gb HDD, My intention is to set the system files to the ssd and the rest to the HDD.\nThe system works fine if I do a direct install using only the HDD, but if I try using the SSD for the system files the computer doesn't boot-up, I do not know if the SSD is being recognized by the computer, I think so because I could install Ubuntu on it, but it doesn't appear on the boot order or the boot menu.\nI read some posts and tried using boot-repair which pointed me not to forget to set my system to boot from my SSD, unfortunately I cannot because of the issues mentioned above.\nThanks for your time.\n\nA: What you could try, is to install the bootloader GRUB2 on the conventional HDD, while having the root (/) partition on the SSD. You probably need to partition your hard drives manually to be able to change this setting (see this screenshot I found here - \"Device for Bootloader-Installation\"). By having GRUB installed on the HDD, you should be able to tell your BIOS to boot Ubuntu from the HDD, while all system files are loaded from the SSD (More accurately: You'll load approximately 440 Bytes from the HDD before everything else is loaded from the SSD).\nIt might nevertheless happen, that a driver is required for the SSD, and that GRUB therefore can not access the files on it. In that case, I'm afraid that you might have to put the /boot directory on a separate partition on the HDD (I'd say at least 200 MB in size - Ubuntu keeps some outdated kernels there in case an update goes wrong). This can be easily done by manually partitioning your hard drives using the normal ubuntu installer. By this, still most system data will be loaded from the SSD, only the kernel (approx 5 MB) and the initial ram disk (approx 15 MB) will be loaded from the HDD.\n\nA: Since you have more than one disk, you need to select the boot disk from BIOS menu. Because if the grub bootloader was installed on the second disk and your BIOS boot order is to boot from 1st disk, the OS in 2nd disk won't be recognized.\nTo select the boot device order, Press F12 (on most motherboard) or F2 or some other key. Look for a message like \"Press X (or something) key to enter Boot menu\". I think you should permanently change the boot device priority by changing BIOS boot order. change the SSD as first device.\n\nA: In my experience, BIOSes usually have a boot order that goes something like this:\n\n\n*\n\n*DVD\n\n*USB\n\n*Hard drive\n\n\nThere's generally a second section to adjust the order of the hard drives, which is probably by default the SATA port order.  So two solutions: reorder the drives physically, or look around more in your BIOS.  If you can find out who makes it and a manual, I'd be happy to help find it.\n\nA: Hello & years later another answer ...\nWhat I did was to use gparted to create a 512mb partition & label & flag it \"boot\"\nAfter that create a partition for your swap (if u are using it) & again label & flag\nFinally format the rest of the drive to ext4 & direct the install to that area\nThat solved my issue ... It was done using PopOs 20.04 ( but have also used this method in Ubuntu 18.04 )\nGood luck\n", "Q: CD/DVD icon on Unity panel/launcher Is it possible to have CD/DVD icon on the launcher by default (regardless of whether CD/DVD is in the tray or not)?\nI have friends who would love to switch to Ubuntu, but Ubuntu does not seem to have drivers for special buttons on the laptop, like the one needed to eject the CD/DVD tray. They own one of those mini laptops which have a CD/DVD tray, but no button on the tray to eject it.\n\nA: If you want to eject CD/DVD drives, you can create a launcher to the following command:\neject\n\nand lock it to Unity launcher. This works if the tray is empty, too.\nCreating a launcher\nCreate a new text file with the following contents:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Eject\nExec=eject\nIcon=cdrom_unmount\nTerminal=false\nType=Application\nStartupNotify=false\n\n(you can replace cdrom_unmount with media-eject or any icon you want)\nand name it Eject.desktop. Right click that file, select \"Permissions\" and check \"Allow executing file as program\". Then you can drag it to the Unity Launcher, and get something like this:\n\nJust click on it and the tray will open.\nIt's not possible to show Unity CD/DVD drive icons if there is no disc in the tray, so this is the best way to get a Unity eject icon.\n", "Q: Manually change the screen resolution My system: Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

Is there a benchmark tool to measure computer performance for Ubuntu like SuperPI, 3DMark, or PCMark?\n\nA: Another option is sysbench.  It is a command line tool with built in tests for CPU, memory, file, threading and database.  There is an article about it here.  Install is a single package, and running tests is quick.\nLikely the quality of results is lower than more sophisticated tests, but I found it useful for a quick sanity check when evaluating potential VPS hosting.\nBased on the popular answer by user76204, I did try Phoronix test suite.  As the author says, it is not quick or simple.  There are 100s of tests available and it's not obvious which to use.  Some require 100s of MB of downloads, some take an hour or more to run, some may not run on your server.  On Ubuntu, I hit a bug described here.\n\nA: The most complete benchmarking software is probably Phoronix test suite, which is available in the repositories and can be installed with:\nsudo apt-get install phoronix-test-suite\n\nWhen running phoronix-test-suite for the first time in terminal, you can either answer yes or no to the questions regarding anonymous statistical reporting. If you answer yes, it says that \n\nThis information is pooled along with the submissions from all other users to show general trends and other details on OpenBenchmarking.org. \n\nIt is up to you whether you choose yes or no, but there is nothing to be concerned with. You can still later upload results manually to openbenchmarking if you wish with the options in the program: \nphoronix-test-suite upload-result <your test-result>\n\nFor more information about Phoronix test suite see this pdf and the official forum.\n\nTo list all the tests available (but not necessarily downloaded), run:\nphoronix-test-suite list-tests\n\nwhich gives tests such as these and many others:\npts/aio-stress               - AIO-Stress                          Disk     \npts/apache                   - Apache Benchmark                    System   \npts/apitrace                 - APITrace                            Graphics \npts/battery-power-usage      - Battery Power Usage                 System   \npts/blogbench                - BlogBench                           Disk    \n\nTo find information on any particular test, you can use:\nphoronix-test-suite info povray\n\nMany of the tests are not installed by default and you can either download an individual test and run it with, for example:\nphoronix-test-suite install povray\nphoronix-test-suite run povray\n\nTo find the lists of thematic test suites, run\nphoronix-test-suite list-suites \n\nwhich returns such things as \npts/audio-encoding               - Audio Encoding                   System\npts/chess                        - Chess Test Suite                 Processor\npts/compilation                  - Timed Code Compilation           Processor\npts/compiler                     - Compiler                         Processor\npts/compression                  - Timed File Compression           Processor\n\nAs an example, you might want to run the entire suite of audio tests (instead of just one from those listed with the list-tests command), so, in this circumstance, enter\nphoronix-test-suite run audio-encoding\n\nFor this test, some more of the related audio tests are downloaded and installed by the program and then the test is run. \nThere are a huge amount of tests to install and options to experiment with, but this test suite is definitely the one to use if you want to get some genuine benchmarks from your Ubuntu system that you can compare online at openbenchmarking and Phoronix.com. \nIt is not a quick, simple benchmarking application, but one that, with its multiple tests, will satisfy most areas of interest in regard to how things perform on Ubuntu. \nHowever, benchmarking is a topic much debated and the forums are best suited for analysing which tests give the most useful results and how the tests should be setup; the one mentioned above, povray, is quite well known and regarded for benchmarking the abilities of a CPU. \n\nA: Install hardinfo which gives benchmark information as shown below screen-shot:\nsudo apt-get install hardinfo\n\n\n\nA: There look to be a number of them listed in the Ubuntu Software Center (search \"benchmark\"), although the only one I've tried is System Profiler and Benchmark.  It gives a lot of computer information and I've found it very useful, but you might want to try out a number of them.\n\nA: I eventually got around to writing a stress test and benchmarking tool for UNIX like systems, namely stress-ng.  It contains over 180 stress tests that allow one to measure throughput on various system components, from memory, cache, CPU, system calls, network, etc.  Install with:\nsudo apt-get install stress-ng\n\nThere is a --metrics-brief option that reports the throughput in terms of bogo ops per second.  One can get a full set of deep CPU and system metrics using the --perf option.  There are many types of stressors that can be run sequentially or in parallel on 1 or more CPUs, for example:\nstress-ng --metrics-brief --cpu 2 -t 1m\n\nthis will exercise the CPU for 1 minute with 2 CPU stressor instances running in parallel.\nThe manual documents all these features in detail, consult the project page or the quick start reference guide\n", "Q: How to make web-server address into dns?

But, when I try to exit and normally reboot, the new password is not recognized by the system. Why is it not working?\n\nA: Normally, admin is not a user in Ubuntu.  The equivalent to admin is \"root\", but you don't normally need a root password.\nIn order to perform administrative tasks, you use your normal user account, and use a command such as \"sudo\" or for gui apps, \"gksu\".\nIf you do have a user named admin, then you need to log in with that name and corresponding password.  But admin is just another user, not anything special.\nEdits\nNote that the password asked for by the updater is for the currently logged-in user, not some administrator or anything.  The user must be in the \"sudoers\" file, or a member of the group named \"sudo\".  In the old days, this was done by \"dropping into a root shell\", ie becoming root/superuser (using the \"su\" command). You would then enter all the administrative commands, and then type \"exit\" to return to your normal shell.  But that required giving all users who might need it the root password, which is not good security; so, modern systems use the sudo method, which allows specified users to have higher levels of privileges without necessarily knowing the root password.\n", "Q: Is es.archive.ubuntu.com down?

However I run my favourite applications on it which includes apps traditionally bundled with GNOME and KDE (gnome-power-statistics, gnome-system-monitor, kate, kdesvn to name a few).\nDoes this significantly diminish  the performance advantage I get from using a lightweight Desktop Environment? As a whole bunch of dependencies are installed when I first install these apps from other desktop environments. \n\nA: In short, \"Yes\". One of the benefits of Linux is it's ability to share common libraries/dependencies among different running applications. Because of this, many users are firmly rooted to GTK, QT, KDE , etc. and will refuse to install apps that have dependencies falling outside of their chosen camp. This line of thinking can have very practical benefits on a low resource machine. Imagine three applications, all based in different tool-kits are running on a single computer. Those applications will then need all their own tool-kit libraries loaded into ram in order to function, even though many of those libraries perform similar functions. Now imagine three apps all running on a some computer, but they are all Gnome-based. In this case, all three Gnome apps can share the same libraries in your ram. As you can see, tool-kit loyalty can certainly decrease your ram usage. As well as decrease data transfer from your hard disk as the system will be retrieving less dependencies.\nThe flip-side to this is that if you have a relatively modern computer you may not notice any difference at all. Multi-core processors, solid-state drives, and gobs of cheap ram make many of these considerations moot. Your biggest concern may actually be that a KDE app doesn't look \"right\" on your GTK+ desktop.\nIn the final analysis, you would have to gauge yourself as to whether your machine is bogging down under the load. If it still feels like normal, then don't worry about it. Enjoy using the applications you like. If it's dragging, then you may have to reconsider looking at some GTK options for future use. Good luck, hope this helps! \n\nA: If you're not running the applications, they should only take up disk space.  I suppose having more files on your hard drive might make things slower (like any indexing for mlocate, installing packages), but this is probably trivial.\nWhile the programs are running, they are taking up RAM.  When executables use the same shared library (there's surely some GTK library overlap between XFCE and GNOME), they can shared the memory where it's been loaded, so this is mitigated a little.\nSome dependencies that are pulled in by the other packages may run in the background automatically, so those might add to your overall memory/CPU footprint as well.  I'm thinking of things like sound daemons and gnome-session.  You'd have to look for these.\nIn short: yes, they certainly will affect performance of your machine.  To a significant degree?  I dunno; depends on your machine.  You'd have to do some benchmarking and specify what \"significant\" means.  Generally, I think if you're not running any of them, it should not make a difference.\n", "Q: Can't access vgaswitcheroo file, access denied?

After that i rebooted and wanted to install XP on new partition. But I could not choose that new partition, also i tried to delete it and create again, i didn't touch partition with Ubuntu and Lubuntu. As this didn't work i couldn't choose this partition i decided to restart and see if i did mistake somewhere in GPARTED. But after restart i get \"Error loading operating system\". \nSeems like i made mistakes in this process. Now if someone can help me solve this? I would be happy if is possible at last backup my data from Ubuntu and Lubuntu.\n\nA: You may wish to try installing XP using VirtualBox, which is a free program from Oracle to create virtual machines, into which you can install XP just like normal, but run it without exiting Ubuntu.  It works well, and can be made to look exactly like the separate XP.\nBut if you want to install it on your drive, make sure you create a Primary Partition, as it will not work on a logical drive.  Also you will find that after installing XP, Ubuntu will no longer be accessible, and you will need to restore GRUB in the boot sector after XP over-writes it with its own boot sector code.  Using VirtualBox will not have this problem.\nAfter you make space, you need to select the empty space, and create a new partition (primary) using ntfs.  If you can't choose primary, then you must be inside a secondary partition.  When that happens, you need to pay attention to the list below the graphical representation, and shrink the extended partition, which is a container around the logical drives.\n\nA: If you just want to back up your data,you can try the following steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*start your laptop with a live-CD or USB(recommended) that is set-up with Startup Disk Creator\n\n*Click on 'Try Ubuntu'\n\n*once logged in, open a folder\n\n*Click on the partitions from where you want to backup your data (partitions can be found on the left hand side of the screen.\n\n*Connect an external hard drive or USB for backing up data\n\n*Copy and paste you files.\n\n\nYou can reinstall Ubuntu, Lubuntu and Windows XP after that.\nTip: Install Windows XP first \n(assuming that you want to install the operating systems alongside each other and not in a virtual machine)\n\nA: if you tried to install windows onto the spare partition then I take it you would have booted off the Windows disk and started the install program?  The Windows installer will install it's own bootloader over the top of grub in the MBR (Windows likes to think it's the only operating system on the planet so you lose the ability to boot Ubuntu).\nThe question on how to re-install grub and get access to your Ubuntu and Lubuntu installations has already been adequately answered here.\nThe problem of getting Windows XP installed on your machine is probably a matter of getting the very first primary partition free and available for install. Again, Windows likes to think it's got full controll of the hard drive.  You should be able to move your partitions up to leave the first primary partition free.  After installing XP you will have to repair the grub bootloader again because Windows will overwrite it again.\n", "Q: Is it safe to Install Both Redis and MySQL on the same system?

I am trying to install Ubuntu Server 12.04 64 bit on a Windows Hyper-V virtual machine. I am having issues with the following error:\nthe grub-pc package failed to install into /target/\n\nI have tried the suggestion of doing a \"rescue failed system\" and doing the apt-get to repair the boot loader, but my virtual machine can't download the updates due to DNS issues (for some reason, it's not getting DNS resolution).\nI have also tried reinstalling the boot loader in the rescue failed system, and the loader appears to install correctly (no errors). But after rebooting the system, it will not boot.\nI'm including a screenshot.\n\nA: I found that the \"the grub-pc package failed to install\" grub installation problem for Ubuntu 12.04.1 Server was related to the degree of network access. If there was no network connection (cable unplugged) Grub-PC installed OK (but then you need to configure the network by hand). If it was connected to an isolated or limited network (LAN access only or bad DNS) that could not contact an external ubuntu server, the Grub-PC installation failed. Only if it had full network access, was Grub-PC able to install correctly, ah including networking. \nSo my suggestion is to first troubleshoot your local network to make sure that it is providing complete Internet access. If it isn't, fix it, or completely disconnect from the network, do the install and then install and troubleshoot the network after the rest of the installation is complete. \n\nA: Indeed it is a problem of network access. I cannot figure it out why. \nI unplugged the network cable and repeated the installation procedure. With success!

I also note that in your .muttrc you do not have a mailboxes line. I use gmail in Mutt and have the following in my .muttrc (though yours may differ):\nmailboxes +INBOX +archive +sent +drafts +spam +trash\n\nI mention this because at Launchpad this error was discussed and someone mentioned that specifying only the correct mailboxes solved his problem.\nComparing your .muttrc to mine in general reveals no other differences, and Mutt and gmail are working for me with almost identical settings.\n\nHowever, if these suggestions do not solve your problem, it is possible to build Mutt from source and ensure that you build it with openssl support, so you can use openssl instead of gnutls. I note that in your second Pastebin, your Mutt has indeed been built with gnutls, as your debug reveals:\n-USE_SSL_OPENSSL  +USE_SSL_GNUTLS\n\nHere - means without that attribute and + means with that attribute. \nSo, before we start building, purge the currently installed mutt:\nsudo apt-get purge mutt\n\nand then get the dependencies with\nsudo apt-get build-dep mutt\n\nIt is fine to use build-dep here as the latest version of mutt (at this time of writing) doesn't require any newer libraries than those fetched with build-dep.\nYou will also need to make sure you enter:\nsudo apt-get install openssl libsasl2-modules libssl-dev libssl1.0.0\n\nNow download the latest source code from the official site (which is 1.5.21 at time of writing) and then verify the appropriate gpg signature, and \ncd to the downloaded file and unpack the source code with\ntar xzvf mutt-1.5.21.tar.gz \n\nThen pass these extra options to configure (we need to include the other options as well as ssl as imap and smtp support and other things are not compiled in by default):\n./configure --enable-pop --enable-imap --enable-smtp --with-ssl --enable-hcache --with-gss --with-sasl --enable-debug --enable-gpgme\n\nThen proceed to build and then install the program with\nmake \nsudo make install or sudo checkinstall\n\nThe build only takes a few moments and it should allow you to use Mutt again. It is probably a good idea to clear the header cache (as I detailed much further above) before you run the new program. It will use ssl automatically as there is now no tls support built in.\nA screenshot from the newly compiled program (showing some older, non-personal emails):\n\n", "Q: Suspend on Powerloss?

Open the new file with the ZIP extension with the free 7-Zip program. You'll find several files inside, including Screen_Stream.avi - this is the actual screen recording file in AVI format. Extract that file.\n\nA: You can use 7-Zip to open .camrec files, it's possible it's just a renamed extension. The video is .AVI inside, however, if you've recorded system audio, it stores it as a separate WAV file, and the Microphone or other selected audio source is encoded into the AVI. I had a great batch process to unpack, remux (to overwrite the microphone with system audio) and encode camrecs to AVI with commandline 7-Zip and virtualdub, but unfortunately lost it in a hard drive crash a few months ago.

My girlfriend's Windows laptop was fine though. I tried disabling adblock, reinstalling flash, reinstalling firefox and various other things. Then I noticed that I was signed in to 4od. I don't remember registering, but perhaps I did. I signed out, and then registered again. It all works fine now. I can use Adblock without problems. I don't know if my registration was funny, or whether a lubuntu or firefox update caused it. It occurred to me that 4od might recognise and block users using Adblock, and my new registration solved this. I don't know, but it worked! I don't think you need to register at all to view things less than 30 days old.\n\nA: \nAs the screenshot shows - running an ondemand channel4 programme within firefox and ubuntu (unity).\nSo how did I do this ... well I used Wine (so please don't hate me!)\nThis is the recipe for this if you want to try.\n\n\n*\n\n*install Wine\n\n*install firefox using winetricks\n\n*manually download flash from Adobe using your normal Ubuntu browser\n\n*install flash using wine.\n\n*launch firefox version of wine and enjoy.\n\n\nIn experimenting I found using the latest Wine (wine 1.7) worked much better than the standard wine 1.6 that is available in the repositories - especially when launching Flash content in fullscreen mode.\nThe windows firefox display is a bit glitchy - but the import part - the programmes appear to run just fine.\n\nDetail:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install wine 1.7\n\n\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:pipelight/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install --install-recommends wine-staging\nsudo apt-get install wine-staging-compat winetricks\n\n\n\n*Install firefox using winetricks\n\n\n\nwinetricks firefox\n\n\n\n*Manually download flash\n\n\nGo to the Adobe website using your Ubuntu browser and download the Windows 7 NPAPI version of flash\n\n\n*Install flash\n\n\n\ncd Downloads\nwine install_flash_player.exe\n\n\n\n*Launch the windows version of firefox\n\n\n\nwine start c:\\run-firefox.bat\n\nNote - for some reason the windows version of firefox seems to use the same profile as the Ubuntu firefox - so if you are using Adblock software you'll need to disable this in ubuntu.

You can use Chromium for the newest version (Chromium developers include flash in browser).\n\nA: The problem seems to affect NEW content on 4OD - ie older content still works as before. There seems to be an update to the encoding/DRM used for new content which doesn't work on the Linux flash player. The only solution for now, as has been suggested, is to use the YouTube channel instead.\n", "Q: Application-specific audio settings Is it possible to select the output device and settings of each application, on an independent basis?

You can control them through the sound menu>sound settings and the application tab. you could also install the gnome-alsamixer: \n   sudo apt-get install gnome-alsamixer\n\nIf you are referring to more specific control settings the applications you are using should provide that.\n", "Q: Maximizing speed on hybrid drive I have a hybrid drive (ST750LX003 to be exact), is 750 GB including an 8 GB SSD. I currently have Ubuntu 12.04 installed, and I recently had a dual-boot installed with Windows 8. The problem is, Win8 booted up much faster than Ubuntu (10-15 seconds vs. 25-30 seconds). I had a suspicion that Windows was stealing the SSD space, so I uninstalled it, and combined the partition with my Ubuntu partition. So far, Ubuntu isn't booting any faster. \nAlso, I know Windows 8 has the hibernation/shutdown feature, but that wasn't working anyways. (i.e. when I selected the power button, it didn't shut down. I had to restart.)\nIs it possible to tell what files are stored on the SSD part of the drive?\nEdit: I do have several partitions on my drive. Is it possible that the SSD space only maps to space in a particular partition?\n\nA: I don't believe it's possible to tell what files are in the SSD cache.  I ran the hybrid drive at a previous job on Win7 and I know it did make a difference in boot time.  Supposedly the drive firmware is supposed to figure out what files are most frequently used and/or used to boot and put them in cache.  It would be quite a destructive experiment but I wonder if a full format would clean out the cache?\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.10: Can't change window title bar font In Ubuntu 12.10 Beta 2, I've tried using Ubuntu Tweak to change the window title bar font, but after it's changed in the application, it's not reflected throughout the system. I've tried different fonts at different sizes with no luck; the window title font and size stay the same.\nI know this is a beta release, but all the other fonts change on the system when I change them in Ubuntu Tweak.  The other fonts (Default, desktop, monospace, etc.) update when they're changed. Just not the window title bar font.\n\nA: I would suggest you use gnome-tweak-tool  to change the title bar font. As of this writing, it works just fine for me. \n\n\nTo install gnome-tweak-tool, run this command:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool\n\n", "Q: Dual booted Ubuntu 12.04 with Windows 7. Question about boot order and where exactly Ubuntu has been installed This is a bit of a 2 parter:\nI recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 on my Windows 7 PC.  I had initially created some free space through diskmgmt.msc for Ubuntu to be installed to.  I never formatted it, but it was left as ~30GB free space.\nWhen it installed I never actually got to pick where to install it to, it just installed.  Now diskmgmt.msc shows that the ~30GB free space is now 2 Primary Partitions, 21GB and ~8GB.  I would provide a screen shot, but new users cannot do this.  The primary partitions however, seem to be totally empty.\nMy question is, did Ubuntu install itself here?  If so, why is the free space marker still at 100% of the drive?\nPart 2:\nIt now seems that Ubuntu is the primary OS, as I am presented with the \"grub\" screen when my PC boots, and when I leave it, it defaults onto Ubuntu, as opposed to the \"aesthetically pleasing\" black on white \"what do you want to boot\" screen.\nI only use Ubuntu to play around with occasionally, or to write C++ in for university work.  Is there a way of restoring Windows back to the primary boot, or is the easiest thing to do to uninstall Ubuntu, and re-install it again.  How will this affect my Windows installation?\nIf I am to do this, how should I ensure that it installs to my 30GB set aside for this purpose, and that it is not my primary OS?\nSorry if this has been answered over and over again, I couldn't find an exact answer to my situation.\n\nA: If this is not a Wubi installation...\nLinux generally requires 2 partitions, a root partition and a swap drive, so the two partitions make sense.  You actually would have had a lot of choices about where to put the installation and what partitions to use, but you probably chose a default, which may have worked out.  \nWhatever Linux installation you install last will be the default OS to boot, so reinstalling will not help.  If you reinstall Windows, it will wipe out Grub completely, and you will not be able to boot Ubuntu, but it will still be on the disk.\nYou can set the amount of delay before booting, and also the default OS that boots.  You can also set it so it boots the last OS you chose, until you boot a new one.\nThe default entry is determined by the GRUB_DEFAULT= setting in /etc/default/grub; the first \"menuentry\" has a value of \"0\".  It can be changed to the number of the Windows entry in the menu, probably \"3\".  Or, it can be changed to the full, exact name of the Windows entry, which is useful if you change things very much. To edit this file, you would enter at a command prompt: gksu gedit /etc/default/grub.  Be careful not to change anything you don't understand, as this is an important file.\nIf you want to change the timeout that grub waits until booting the default, you can change the value for GRUB_TIMEOUT, which defaults to 10.\nNote instructions at the top of the file about running \"update-grub\" after any changes to actually change the menu file at /boot/grub/grub.cfg.  This file could also be edited to make the changes, but they will get overwritten on certain occasions.\nMore information can be found here.\n\nA: How did you install Ubuntu?  It seems like you might have done a Wubi install, which is installing a virtual drive inside of Windows.  Boot windows and have a look to see if there is a folder c:\\ubuntu\\disks\nInside of this folder will be a file called boot.dsk.  This is your Ubuntu Virtual disk.\nIf this is not the case, please boot Ubuntu paste the contents of the file /etc/fstab here so we can see what is going on.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 wireless does not detect networks I installed Ubuntu on a partition of my MacBook Pro.

Is there any software which can do that?\nNote: that i have bought cd's which are 30/70 hrs long and i'm trying to burn some mp3 tracks on audio cd's.\n\nA: Audio CDs (that is, ones conforming to the Red Book standard) use uncompressed Linear PCM for their data so take up huge swathes of space on a compact disc. Some are extended (thinner spindles, more outer tracks) but these improvements give minutes extra.\nThe limits for audio on CD are just under 80 minutes. Their bitrate is 1411kbps.\nIf you put compressed audio on a CD as data, you can change things around. You can use something like the Speex codec to get things down to just 4kbps if you wanted to. With that you could fit 450-470 hours* on a data CD.\nThe only problem is you're limited to where you can play this disc. Any player will need to know the Speex coded so almost all CD players (eg Hi-Fis) are going to struggle. You'll most likely need to play the disc through a computer.\nIf this is no good, you could look at low-bitrate MP3 (16-48kbps VBR - any lower will be horrible) and you'll only get ~50 hours per disc but a lot more hardware CD players support MP3 tracks. That has been an increasingly common feature in them for some years.\n* There's going to be a bit of overhead from the file format but it'll be a hell of a lot more than 80 minutes or 80 hours.\n", "Q: i want to install ubuntu 12.04 alongside windows 7, not inside it I installed Edubuntu 12.04 alongside windows 7 ultimate on my asus laptop and it worked ok\nthen i tried to do it for two of my friends, both HP and windows 7 ultimate, but instead of showing \"install ubuntu alongside windows 7\" it says install it inside the Windows OS\ni want it outside of Windows and to be alongside it, how's that?\nThanks\n\nA: OK. \nThis is a problem when a Laptop comes with already 4 primary partitions in MBR (cuz GPT has not this limit). \nMBR has this limit where you cannot create another primary partition when 4 of them already exists. \nI bet that your friend(s) laptop have 4 primary partitions. Usually 2 for Windows and 2 are 1) HP-Tools and 2) The Recovery partition. \nThe easy way is to delete one of the partitions, for example: Recovery Partition - (BUT you will LOSE the ability to recover your Windows) or Hp-tools (but sometimes are useful).\nHere is the way on how to install Ubuntu when you already have 4 primary partitions and you don't mind to delete one: My disk already has 4 primary partitions, how can I install Ubuntu?\nThe hard way is to convert the Windows C: partition from primary to Logical.\nWhen you do this , you will be able to create Logical partitions and install Ubuntu normally.\nSo our goal here is to convert the Windows C: primary partition to Logical and  to resize the C: partition to leave a space for Ubuntu installation. \nNow take a big breath and read carefully. \n\n\n*\n\n*First of all we must defragment the hard disk to avoid mistakes and tough situations. After defrag finish we proceed.\n\n*Boot in to Windows and download the free version of Partition Wizard and install it.\n\n*When installation finish , open the application as an Administrator. (right click and open as administrator)\n\n*Select the Windows C: partition and right click and modify and select \"Set partition as Logical\"\n\nThen a window with 3 options will pop-up . We must select the option with the reboot. . The conversion will be done during reboot , as it cannot be done when partition is mounted. \n\n\n*\n\n*When the process of conversion finish , it will boot again in Windows. We open again the Partition Wizard (as administrators). \n\n*Now we want to resize the C: partition. So we select the C: partition and then we select move/resize. \n \nResize the partition always from the end to begin (and never from the begin , cuz there are critical Windows files) and again a window with 3 options will pop-up. Again we select the option with the reboot inside. Because the resize can be done only when partition is unmounted. (during reboot).\n\n\n*\n\n*When resize complete successfully it will boot in to Windows again. Now we open for the last time the Partition Wizard (as administrators) and select the Unallocated space and create a NTFS filesystem (Yes NTFS , no matter we will delete it after, but creation of NTFS decrease the possibilities of a mistake as we are in a Windows Environment). After the creation of filesystem it is time to boot in Ubuntu. \n\n*Boot in Ubuntu from the LiveCd/Usb and begin the installation process. When you reach the window with the options , select \"Something Else\" \n\n*Locate the NTFS partition we created and click \"change\" . Then allocate the space you want (leave some space for the swap partition)  and mount it to root.\nDo not forget to mark the \"Format the partition\". Do the same for Swap area. \n \n\nEnjoy Ubuntu !\n\nA: Don't use the \"Windows installer for Ubuntu Desktop\", also known as Wubi.

Recently I've switched from lightDM to GDM\nHow can I resolve this error?\n\nA: sudo apt-get remove gdm\nsudo dpkg -i /path/to/deb/file\nBe aware that because you are installing this deb from a file and from another repository that you may have to pull in other dependencies from Mint. Those new dependencies may break stuff in Ubuntu as well. But, honestly, as Mint is Ubuntu-based I don't see that happening. Just wanted to warn you in advance so you know what you're getting yourself into.\nAlso, as you probably know, since you're installing from a file you'll have to manually update the packages/dependencies.\n", "Q: Why does the Software Centre ask me to install untrusted packages?

I clicked on my proxy connection, selected Configure, and noticed the proxy was set to \"Connect Automatically\". I disabled the automatic proxy connection and was able to update and install software again without problems.\nThanks for all your help.\n\nA: The reason you're getting this \"untrusted\" error is because of the GPG key download failure. Modern repositories are signed with a private GPG key and they distribute a public GPG key so that the signature can be verified by end-users.\nTheoretically this helps to prevent package downloads in the case that somebody replaces a package on the repository site with an unsigned version (may contain malware, spyware, etc.) This assumes that the \"attacker\" doesn't have the private GPG key to sign the packages.\nSo, you're getting the error because of the failed GPG key download. Apt can't verify the integrity of the package signature because it doesn't have the public key available to decrypt it.\nGenerally, it's not a good idea to download/install unverified software. But if you know the software and trust it, you can go ahead and install it without worries.\n", "Q: sshfs - No such file or directory I'm trying to mount a folder over ssh using sshfs.

Is there a way to fix this?\n\nA: It would help if you could give some examples of applications that cannot see the drive, but I could bet these are the ones that are not integrated with Gnome. \nIn any case, you should try to see whether your NAS has been mounted with gvfs (this should be the case if you mount it from Nautilus). Go to your home directory, and change to a hidden directory called .gvfs/. Your volumes should be mounted here, and all the applications that cannot find it like Nautilus does should be able to navigate to these mount points.\nYou see, what happens is this: in Unix/Linux, any shares / drives / etc. are mounted within the normal filesystem hierarchy. Nautilus and a couple of other applications additionally show these mounts on the left side of the file selection, but this is an additional behavior. If you can access the shares with Nautilus, then they are mounted somewhere, and any application, even if it only understand local filesystem, should be able to find it.\n", "Q: Which tools helps to start Ubuntu GUI when boot?

Just follow this instructions: Mounting FakeRAID\nPlease note, that fake raid controller are just like software raids. Linux will show you both hard drives even they are in raid mode.\nBut, I think it would be more safe to mount the hard drive with Windows and creating a backup. Using DMRaid could break your file system. You should also avoid using dynamic Windows volumes. If there is no license/installation media for Windows anymore you can download the Evaluation Version of Windows 2008 R2 Server: Windows 2008 R2 Evaluation Version\nThe best way for changing a operating system is to backup a raid on a extra device and rebuild the raid after installing the new operating system.\n", "Q: Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon support I am considering selling my Mac to get money towards a Lenovo Thinkpad X1 because what I really want to do is to be running an Ubuntu system all the time.\nIs this machine completely supported in Ubuntu, with no tiny little feature missing just because I am \"going Linux\"?\nOptional user story section, skip to the question below if you don't have time:\n\nI have a friend who bought a \"works on Ubuntu\" system a year ago and has hated the fact ever since: battery lasts less than if he boots in Windows (which he despises) and he ascribes that to \"no good OS/harware integration and support for advanced chipset power management features\", odd behaviour on suspend/resume/hibernate (says: \"when it works 90% of the time and the other 10% it makes you lose your work is as good as broken -> 90% is the same as 0% he says), some occasional graphics card glitches he can perfectly well live with and has almost grown affectionate to, and finally, and that is what would make him undo his choice if he could, bad \"input device drivers\".

It's possible that other vendors may provide their own certification that is separate.\nThe Thinkpad X1 Carbon is on the list, but for \"pre-installed systems only\".\nThat is, this laptop is available in some countries with Ubuntu pre-installed, and Ubuntu is officially certified for use on this laptop only if it is one of those pre-installed ones.\nThey say:\n\nStandard images of Ubuntu may not work at all on the system or may not work well, though Canonical and computer manufacturers will try to certify the system with future standard releases of Ubuntu.\n\nThere are additional notes too.  Check it out:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/certification/hardware/201204-10913/\nThat said, just because Ubuntu is not certified doesn't mean it won't work.  Ubuntu is intended to run on as much hardware as possible, especially traditional PC desktops and laptops.\n\nA: linlap says nothing about linux support and X1 Carbon http://www.linlap.com/lenovo_thinkpad_x1\n\nA: I have the 1st gen X1 Carbon and have been running Ubuntu on it for two years now.

I really love it running ubuntu 14.04.\nI modified ubuntu 14.04 with a few tweaks to get really everything working. See Lenovo X1 Carbon 2015 3rd gen 20 BS - trackpoint, clickpad and wifi \n\nA: This answer received a few down votes, because some people stumble upon this question when they seek for an answer to hardware recommendation. However this answer also (or may be mostly) deals with the ideological part of the initial question.\n\nThe SD card reader and the fingerprint reader will not work (fingerprint readers are for convenience and don't improve security). All in all, there is no big difference to the T530 base configuration I am currently using with 12.04. It's mostly the Thinkpad 2012 platform with an Intel processor in the smallest chassis.\nFrom my experience with my T530 booting in UEFI mode works fine. Hibernate and resume work fine and fast with an mSATA SSD, but you should always save your work. Input devices work fine, you may just have to configure the behavior (pointer speed) to match that from the other operating system.\n\nYou want to have control over your computing devices, which is good and GNU licensed software – like Linux – that protects your four kinds of freedom is a good direction and starting point.\nHowever bringing an attitude that is focused only on consumption to the community isn't healthy. The ideal situation, of course, should be that everything works right out of the box. However unless you have a support contract with someone you cannot expect that your demand for such a thing is instantly fulfilled and it's in your best interest to get involved. (Your friend should have done the same.) Otherwise, if you have a support contract, please use the contacts provided in the contract.\nGiven that users and developers care to contribute and take responsibility, a free and libre software ecosystem can deliver great software quality and user experience where several companies not committing to work together may be unsuccessful and patronize users. But this is more of an ideal and making a purchase decision on what's currently available on the market, probably heavily marketed and labeled as \"cutting edge\" or latest generation, is the first step of degrading this ideal to a bad compromise, which will get worse when you keep the consumer attitude and don't get involved with the community.\nYou need to realize that too many manufacturers on the market don't respect your rights because their primary goal is to be profitable, not a charity. You shouldn't feel constrained to buying products that don't improve your quality of life by the amount you expected, just because the market doesn't care.\n\n I know many would rather choose lifestyle and state of the art patented and dongled technology over pure free hardware designs. Initially the concept of patents was to protect the inventor while allowing access for others but mostly gets negative press due to abuse. On a similar note getting funding for science and research apparently got more difficult and is somehow set up with wrong incentives.\n\nIt's up to the consumer to decide how slow the industry moves towards respecting your freedom and free hardware designs that work flawless with free software and it requires more than just replacing one brand with another.\nRegarding this topic I would currently recommend watching the talk from Richard Stallman from the Chaos Communication Congress of 2014: 31C3 - 6123 - Freedom in your computer and in the net.\nIt's not as mean-spirited as one would expect, because that wouldn't be helpful at all. (Some people in the audience got their share later that day, 6205) While his introduction may leave many puzzled and one may find him awkward, it's more convincing to try to use devices that respect your freedom than the every now and then failure in escapism of someone trying to write an article about her/his experience on living without a certain device or service. Never forget that devices that respect your freedom are vital to protect and fight for your rights, civil rights, everything you take for granted or were unaware of (like rights of people that don't live in your state or country).\n", "Q: How to enable YouTube which is banned on a system I have YouTube banned in my system. How can I enable it?\nI tried to lookup for it in /etc/hosts.deny file but couldn't locate it.\nLooking for an Ubuntu specific solution, how to disable/enable it?\ndoes modifying hosts.deny helps or not?\n\nA: I'm not sure that this is the right place to ask that question, since it's got nothing to do with Ubuntu (or any specific OS for that matter), BUT... Since it's already there, I might as well answer you :)\nA note first: Before anyone thinks that it is 'not right' to try to circumvent a rule like this, there can actually exist a number of situations when there is no other way to access somethings that are otherwise completely legal and allowed and there's nothing wrong in doing so or trying to do so. I myself have had an awful opportunity to live in a place where so many convenient websites are blocked on a country level (I'm talking about Skype and Flickr and things like that, completely harmless). Also, rational people should not be approving any kind of restrictions, and grown-ups need to be responsible for their own actions.\nDepending on the method used to block the content, there might be one or more methods (or none :) ) that you can use. The first thing that I'd suggest is trying to use a proxy server. You can do it in several ways. The best place to start would be Hide My Ass. There you can:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use a web proxy: Just type an address in the Web Proxy field on the Hide My Ass homepage;\n\n*Find the List of ip:port proxy addresses that you can use in your browser. If you don't know how to use these addresses, please leave a comment here;\n\n\nYou can also find many useful instructions on that website.\nA second solution is to use Tor project and its Vidalia tool. Basically, it's a shared connection tool. You have several options there too.\n\n\n*\n\n*One, download and install Vidalia Bundle. It includes the proxy\nsolution and a browser already set up to work with Tor network.\n\n*Or you can install Vidalia tool separately (I believe it's available\nfrom Ubuntu Software Centre) and then set up your browser to use a\nproxy server on your localhost address.\n\n\nThere is some great documentation on Vidalia's website, but if you're having trouble with it, feel free to leave a comment here.\nAnother possible solution that I just remembered might help you is to download and install Opera desktop browser. When you open Opera, enable its Opera Turbo feature. Opera Turbo is a traffic compression tool by Opera, but by nature it uses Opera's proxy servers. That might be handy.\nFinally, also in Opera, you have a feature to browse internet in a 'Private tab'. I'm really not sure if that will help, but it's worth mentioning. I also have no idea if any other browser has this feature. To enable private browsing in Opera, click on Opera button > Tabs and Windows > New private tab, and browse away :)\n\nA: used https instead of http and I was able to open the youtube :)\n", "Q: Intermittently Won't Boot - Black Screen With Blinking Cursor - 12.04 \nPossible Duplicate:\nMy computer boots to a black screen, what options do I have to fix it? \n\nI have a fresh install of Ubuntu on my laptop.  This MAY be a duplicate question, by my situation seems to be slightly different from other people who are/were experiencing similar issues so I thought it would be best to open a new question.  It is similar to this question, but not exactly the same.\nI also want to preface this with the knowledge that I am a Linux noob.  I installed Ubuntu on my laptop with the express purpose of learning Linux.  That being said I am a Computer Sciences major and have worked in IT for years, just entirely in a Windows environment.  So while I am pretty computer...savvy in general, I don't know much in the way of *nix command line commands and such.\nAnyways, I installed Ubuntu from the Live CD.  I did run into some trouble installing it where I would get a black blinking cursor, but was able to get around it by setting the nomodeset parameter (similar to what is referenced in the first answer to the question I linked above).\nSo anyways, got it installed, worked great, grabbed all the updates from the Ubuntu Software center, grabbed a few updates, practiced using SSH to get into my Linux account in my school's computers, etc etc.\nBut now issue is I intermittently get the same black blinking cursor option on bootup.  It makes it to the OS selection screen every time, but sometimes it will boot up fine, other it hangs on the black screen with blinking cursor after I choose an OS to boot into.  Can't seem to figure out what the determining factor is.  If it happens, I just manually reboot 2 or 3 times until it goes away, but it really is frustrating, and a bit worrisome because (and this could be my imagination) but it seems to be increasing in frequency.  For example, I have gotten one successful boot out of 7 attempts while writing this on my desktop.\nI got the impression from the linked question above, and from a few other forum posts, that this is usually caused by a graphics card driver incompatibility with ATI or Nvidia graphics cards, and that that's where the nomodeset parameter comes in.  HOwever, my laptop is using integrated Intel graphics.  Also, in my experience, driver incompatibilities, especially ones that stop your computer from booting, aren't usually intermittent.  Either they work or they don't manually rebooting a few times doesn't make the problem temporarily go away.  \nAlso I did try setting the nomodeset parameter by pressing 'e' on the OS selection screen, and it still hung up, though this time it hung up on a purple screen, no text.  The next time I tried it with nomodeset I got a bunch of text and it hung up on:\n\n[0.305025]   NMI watchdog enabled, takes one hw-pmu counter.\n[0.305129]   Booting node  0, Processors #1\n[0.424438]   NMI watchdog enabled, takes one hw-pmu counter.\n[0.424542]   #2\n[0.532213]   NMI watchdog enabled, takes one hw-pmu counter.\n[0.532320]   #3\n\nI also tried booting into (recovery mode) and it made it to:\n\n[0.305025]   NMI watchdog enabled, takes one hw-pmu counter.\n[0.305129]   Booting node  0, Processors #1\n[0.424438]   NMI watchdog enabled, takes one hw-pmu counter.\n[0.424542]   #2\n\nThe only thing that struck me as being out of sorts during the boot was the line:\n[0.312575] PEBS disabled due to CPU errata\n\nIn case this helps the laptop is the Asus UA46E-BAL7.  I do not having any USB devices plugged in.  Also it is dual-booting with Windows 7, though I had not yet booted into Win7 until after this happened, merely to test to see if that was having trouble as well (so far seems to boot fine every time).  While it is brand new to me, it was a refurbed so a hardware issue isn't out of question, and the text logging seems to indicate a CPU issue, but that doesn't explain why it works fine in Windows.\nAgain, if this was a Windows machine I would be able to troubleshoot it.  Boot into safemode, check for driver incompatibilities, run any one of the bootable hardware diagnostic disks I have, perform a repair installation of Windows, etc.  But for Linux I don't know where to begin.\n\nA: I may have fixed this issue.\nAdded apic to grub based on These instructions.\nNot entirely sure what that does or why it fixed it, from what I could tell apic is related to power saving options, but my laptop seems to be running smooth quiet and cool so I should be in the clear.\nAny potential issues I should be on the lookout for having that disabled?\n", "Q: Ubuntu dual boot OS crashed my computer.

I really like ubuntu, and I rarely boot on to windows 7 now. However, one issue that I could not resolve, was that my hard drive heats up on every ubuntu variant that I have tried. I already have tried cleaning dust out of my laptop,and proprietary graphic drivers (Nvidia Gt540M) are installed, and bumblebee is running well. \nI have googled around for a solution, and have experimented with laptop-mode-tools, and powertop. They did little towards solving the overheating issue. My hard drive still hits 60+ degrees celcius when running on AC. \nThe hard drive temperature reaches 60 degrees when connected to AC, and the palmrest, located right over the hard drive, becomes very warm, bordering on hot.\n  Is there any way to reduce hard drive heating? I really like Lubuntu,and am not willing to move to another distro. \n\nA: Here's the solution:\nlaptop-mode-tools is controlling power management for your hard drive, and you need to configure it appropriately for your situation.\nOpen /etc/laptop-mode/laptop-mode.conf for editing with root privileges, and around line 276 (on Ubuntu 12.04), change this value to 600\nNOLM_HD_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=7200\nThis is the amount of time before your drive is told to \"spin down\" or idle on AC power. 10 minutes with no read/write activity is reasonable.\nAnd around lines 290-291 (on Ubuntu 12.04), change both these values to 1:\nLM_AC_HD_POWERMGMT=254\nNOLM_AC_HD_POWERMGMT=254\nThese set the power management level granted to the drive, with 1 being \"full\" power management, and 254 being \"almost zero\" power management. The latter setting is the reason for your temperatures, because you can set the level, but how the drive manages power at a level is entirely up to it -- it completely depends on the implementation in the drive's firmware, and can vary by model, manufacturer, etc.\nWith the changes, we are now telling the drive to perform the same power management it does while on battery (which is satisfactory for you). This is different from simply allowing the drive to spindown while on AC (as in @EliahKagan's answer), because that would still leave the drive's power management set to near zero at level 254.\nHow to determine power management level\nTo find out the current level, while on battery, AC, or any other situation:\nsudo hdparm -I /dev/sda | grep Advanced (replace sda appropriately)\nSource and credits: Hard drive overheats when laptop running on AC power\n\nA: I think it might be because of the temporary swap partition that Ubuntu uses... that is if Ubuntu is installed after Windows7.

What's the difference between Ubuntu and backtrack? Like I know it's different Kernels. Is it just a deb system with all installed in it for convenience?\n\nA: I think I can give only a brief idea as detailed comparison will be beyond a Q&A website.\nBacktrack is customised Debian/Ubuntu style linux \nAs per the website of Backtrack linux it is a \nPenetration Testing and Security Auditing Linux Distribution, thus a specialised Linux distribution which is very good for some specific purposes.\nWebsite further states \"BackTrack is a Linux-based penetration testing arsenal that aids security professionals in the ability to perform assessments in a purely native environment dedicated to hacking.\". For more details see http://www.backtrack-linux.org/\nNow Ubuntu is a general purpose operating system for day to day tasks for common man. It can be used for advanced purposes. But to use it as a 'Penetration Testing and Security Auditing Linux Distribution' you would need to customise it and install specific packages. And backtrack just did that.

During the boot-up process, select “Try Ubuntu without installation\".\n\n*From the dash, search for Disk Utility.\n\n*Choose the HDD in you want to install windows at and then format choosing NTFS as File system.\n\n\n*Now restart your PC and install Windows to the new partition (HDD).\nAlso you can use GParted to do that.\nYou can install GParted by\nsudo apt-get install gparted\n\nFor more info about GParted, check its manual.\n\nA: Sorry for my inconvenience. Have overseen - that Windows has the spleen always to install and always to boot as first OS on the first partition or harddisk.\n", "Q: Open source vs Proprietary drivers for Video and Image Editing Which drivers would be better to use if someone is using applications for Image and Video Editing (like GIMP, Inkscape, OpenShot, Cinelerra, PiTiVi, KdenLive, Avidemux, Kino, Lives and others) in matter of performance and quality: AMD Radeon Open Source driver or ATI/AMD Proprietary drivers?\n\nA: The propriatary drivers are normally a lot faster than the Open Source ones in 3D acceleration so I would figure that the impact will depend on the software. If the video or photo editor uses 3D acceleration then you will notice a difference. For everything else not so much, the 2D performance of the open source drivers is pretty good.\n\nA: There should not be any performance differences when you install software drivers via the Additional Software Drivers tool that comes built in with Ubuntu. \nThat is the recommended way to install drivers and it is how I personally install drivers, such as those for my video card, which is an ATI Radeon 5450. \nI don't know if the drivers installed via said tool are different from those installable for windows but I actually have better performance and less hardware usage in Ubuntu compared to windows. I've edited images in GIMP as well as edited videos on both Ubuntu and Windows. \nSimply put install your drivers via the Additional Software drivers and you should have no performance issues.\n", "Q: Document Management System Is there any Document Management System in Ubuntu?\nI tried Alfresco, RavenDB, Owl, Document Manager.\nAlfresco, RavenDB are heavy.

Getting them to start using Linux was a big step and I am just happy that they are attempting something new... and it was in the open source world.. \n\nA: Just use the sudo word in front of the command in the bash script. And when you execute the file, select \"Open in terminal\", you will be asked for password.\nFor example, if you are using apt-get commands , you can use like this\n#!/bin/sh\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\n.....\n.....\n\nIf need to make this executable and when you double click there will be a prompt like this\n\nYou need to click on Open in terminal button and provide password in the terminal\nUpdate\nAs Karthick T commented, you can also use the gksu or gksudo word before the command. So, the file could be\ngksu apt-get update\ngksudo apt-get install <some-package>\n\nDouble clicking the script will ask the password and run the command after you provided it.\n\nA: I've had to do this several times, this is a template of my scripts that need to run as root and prompt the user for the root password.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\ncmdname=$(basename $)\n\nfunction usage() {\n    echo\n    echo \"$cmdname [-l|--location] /location/to/package [-p|--no-provisioning]\"\n    echo \"  -l | --location     Set the location to be used to find the package install\"\n    echo \"  -p | --no-provision If set, will not load the example provisioning\"\n    exit 1\n}\n\nif [ \"$(whoami)\" != \"root\" ]; then\n    echo \"You must be root to do this\"\n    su -c \"$0 $*\"\n    exit\nfi\n\nLOCATION=\"/tmp/TESTPKG$USER/\"\nPROVISION=1\n\nOPTIONS=$(getopt -o l:p --long location:,no-provisioning -n \"$cmdname\" -- $*) || usage\neval set -- $OPTIONS\n\nwhile true ; do\n    case $1 in\n        -l|--location)\n            LOCATION=$2\n            shift 2;;\n        -p|--no-provisioning)\n            PROVISION=0\n            shift 1;;\n        --) shift ; break ;;\n        *)\n            echo \"Invalid argument $1\"\n            exit 1;;\n    esac\ndone\n\nThe above is for a specific use case, but I think it highlights two nice features, using getopt and asking for root permission and running command, while passing in the arguments.\nSo the if block check if the user is currently root, if not, runs the called script ($0) with any arguments passed to the script ($*). Then it exits, as to not attempt to run the script as the non-root user.\nThe getopt line attempts to then parse the options and if there is an invalid argument it prints the usage and exits.\n", "Q: 802.1q VLAN interface configuration on Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop What is the correct way of configuring virtual LAN interfaces (hopefully without messing up Network Manager) on Ubuntu 12.04 Desktop?\nSimply adding the interface to /etc/network/interfaces seems to cause Network Manager some confusion:\nauto vlan500\niface vlan500 inet static\n...\n...\nvlan_raw_device eth1\n\nIs there a better way of doing it?\nupdate: \nI updated /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf with a no-auto-default clause, and set managed=false in the [ifupdown] section:\n[main]\nplugins=ifupdown,keyfile\ndns=dnsmasq\n\nno-auto-default=6C:FD:12:34:56:78,\n\n[ifupdown]\nmanaged=false\n\nThis keeps NetworkManager from firing up eth0, and makes it stay away from eth1 and it's VLAN interfaces. Previously it would only let a single VLAN interface be up, and it would put the static IP of that VLAN interface directly on the eth1 physical interface.\nStill, there is a 2 minute delay during boot as (I presume) NetworkManager is trying to work out the network configuration. \nSolution:\nSolved by creating keyfiles as described in my answer below. My desktop now boots with all VLAN interfaces up and running, and without any delays during boot.\n\nA: *\n\n*Install VLAN package on your computer:\nsudo apt-get install vlan\n\n*Edit your /etc/network/interfaces file so it would contain the following:\n\n#The loopback network interface\n\nauto lo\niface lo inet loopback\n\n\n#This is a list of hotpluggable network interfaces.\n#They will be activated automatically by the hotplug subsystem.\n\n\nauto vlan500\n\n\n# VLAN 500\n\niface vlan500 inet static\naddress xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\nnetmask xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\nnetwork xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\nbroadcast xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\nmtu 1500\nvlan_raw_device eth0\n\nNote: You have to replace my IP addresses, network masks and gateway IP address with your own.\n3.Make sure that switch interface you are connected to configured with respective VLANs.\n4.Restart your network interface:\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking restart\n\nYou should see something like:\nSet name-type for VLAN subsystem. Should be visible in /proc/net/vlan/config\nAdded VLAN with VID == 500 to IF -:eth0:-\n\n\nA: Turns out there is no VLAN support in the ifupdown plugin that lets Network Manager work with /etc/network/interfaces, so instead we will have to manually add a keyfile for Network Manager. \nFirst generate an UUID for the VLAN interface\nroot@kayna:~# uuidgen -r\n5985c23f-2f9b-4e09-a33e-97505c79c78f\n\nThen create the keyfile, here is an example for vlan id 200 on physical interface eth1\nroot@kayna:~# vi /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/vlan200\n\n[connection] \nid=vlan200 \ntype=vlan\nuuid=5985c23f-2f9b-4e09-a33e-97505c79c78f\n\n[vlan] \nparent=eth1\nid=200\n\n[ipv6] \nmethod=ignore\n\n[ipv4] \nmethod=auto\n\nThe interface will not show up in the GUI, but can be seen and managed with nmcli\nroot@kayna:~# nmcli dev\nDEVICE     TYPE              STATE        \neth1.200   vlan              connected    \neth0       802-3-ethernet    disconnected \neth1       802-3-ethernet    connected    \n\nStop and start the interface with\nroot@kayna:~# nmcli con down id vlan200\n\nroot@kayna:~# nmcli con up id vlan200\n\nActive connection state: activating\nActive connection path: /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/ActiveConnection/12\nstate: activated\nConnection activated\n\nThe interface is created using the eth1.200 format, not the vlan200 format typically used in /etc/network/interfaces\nroot@kayna:~# ifconfig eth1.200\neth1.200  Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr c8:60:00:00:00:56  \n          inet addr:192.168.1.46  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0\n          UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1\n          RX packets:185 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0\n          TX packets:55 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0\n          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0 \n          RX bytes:29811 (29.8 KB)  TX bytes:9549 (9.5 KB)\n\n", "Q: What are the absolutely bare minimum requirements for running local juju?

The folder should be called 2010_07_16_RT3062_Linux_STA_v2.4.0.0. I recommend extracting the folder in your Desktop folder or home folder so it is easier to get to. Then go to the terminal and type the following (Assuming it is on the desktop):\ncd ~/Desktop/2010_07_16_RT3062_Linux_STA_v2.4.0.0\n\n\n*Blacklist the default module for this Wireless Driver (This way, when you use the new driver module it works without creating a problem with the older one):\nsudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\n\nAdd at the bottom of the file the following line:\nblacklist rt2800usb  \nblacklist rt2800pci\n\nAnd save the file.\n\n*Now go to 2010_07_16_RT3062_Linux_STA_v2.4.0.0/os/linux/ and edit the file config.mk\n  Change the following variables:\nHAS_NATIVE_WPA_SUPPLICANT_SUPPORT=n\n\n  change it to \nHAS_NATIVE_WPA_SUPPLICANT_SUPPORT=y\n\n  and save the file.\nNOTE: When opening the config.mk file, do not only change the HAS_NATIVE_WPA_SUPPLICANT to a value of y, but also do it with HAS_WPA_SUPPLICANT in case it has n. In my case it had y but it should be checked to make sure both WPA_SUPPLICANT are set to y.\n\n*Go to your main extracted folder (It should be the 2010_07_16_RT3062_Linux_STA_v2.4.0.0 folder) and type the following:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-generic\nmake      \nsudo make install\n\n\n*If everything compiled correctly do the following:  \nmodprobe rt3562sta\n\n\n*If step 7 runs without any problems, we add the module to the list of modules to loaded upon every boot:\nsudo gedit /etc/modules\n\n and add a line at the end of the file that says rt3562sta. \nSave and exit.

So when a program simply does not exist for Linux, you cannot install it (at least with the native way).\nYou can use either Wine or VirtualBox and resolve your problem.    \nIn case you just need to exchange files from pc to phone you can use ADB -> ADB and Sony xperia\nFrom Ubuntu community wiki\n\n\n*\n\n*How to install and use Wine --> WineDB Sony Companion\n\n*How to install and use VirtualBox--> Virtual Box and Sony Companion \n\nA: *\n\n*Install virtualbox and extensionpack (for usb support) from their website\n\n*In your user/group settings (ubuntu) add your linux username in group 'vboxusers' (for rights adding usb devices)\n\n*Create windows session in vb\n\n*Connect your device and add them in usb settings (virtualbox settings. or windows won't recognize it. Has to be done for every device u want to use)\n\n*Connect in flashboot as well and add the usb device (turn phone on while holding volume up)\n\n*Start windows session and install windows\n\n*Download phonedriver and flashbootdriver from sony website and install in windows.\n-Install pc companion and you should be fine.\n\n\nI advise to make a proper backup with pc companion before upgrade, because sometimes windows crashes..\nEasiest way is to ask someone with a windows machine ;-)\nI tested with a windows 7 copy from digital river (official), didn't enter a serial and didn't avtivate.. So 30 day trial..\nThank god most updates are handled on the phone itself.. But the upcoming new android version can only installed by the companion..\nPc companion is the only thing i need windows for, so this is fine for me.\n\nA: regarding installing PC Companion in Ubuntu (Linux)\nMight be redundant, for sync and backup of phone contacts, calendar etcetera simply get a Google+ account and all these matters are solved. Works perfectly calendar functions simple aswell as more hardcore fex mailing a meeting to other participants that use Google+ and have Android phones, the reciepent answer and tells if they are taking part of it or not, if yes the booking appears in ther phone aswell :-)\nFor filebackup simply connect your Android smartphone (fex Experia S) via USB cable and all files appear in Ubuntu as a portable USB disc, just drag and drop.....\nor, connect your Sony Xperia S to a USB portable disc using OTG (On the go) USB cable and move all files to that memory or harddrive :-) really simple.... Go Sony...\nWhen in need of Android update of OS, well, depends on the carrier, Ive got Telia in Sweden and so far all updates have been via the phones internet connection.

I'd recommend starting off with some basic internet troubleshooting:  \n\n\n*\n\n*If you're using Wi-Fi, disconnect then reconnect.\n\n*\n\n*If that doesn't fix it, try rebooting the router.\n\n\n*Can you load any pages at all? If not, get the bugs worked out of your internet. When you can reliably browse the web, try again.\n\n\nIf basic internet troubleshooting isn't cutting it, try temporarily changing your DNS (don't worry; this is not permanent, and is much easier than it sounds!)\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to the Network Connections manager. (Click on your connection icon in the system tray and choose Edit Connections. The one accessable via the System Settings panel doesn't have what we need.)\n\n*Go to the appropriate tab (Wired/Wireless) and click New. Name it something like \"Home Wi-Fi (OpenDNS)\" or \"McDonald's Wi-Fi (OpenDNS)\" or \"Auto Ethernet (OpenDNS)\".\n\n*Enter the details of your connection, but don't click Save... just yet.\n\n*After you have all the appropriate details set up, go to the IPv4 Settings tab. (This procedure is identical for both Wired and Wireless.)\nChoose Automatic (DHCP) addresses only.\n\n*Okay, brace yourself, this is the really, really hard part, I mean it:\nUnder DNS Servers, enter 208.67.222.222, 208.67.220.220.

I am using a Lan connection to have internet (it is like those connections when you have to enter a user name and password), but if i want to use internet in other place like for making updates or using a different program that needs internet, it is impossible. I don't know if it is because of the configuration of the Lan I am using or is my computer. In fact the only browser I can use is Firefox and because I configured something but i don't remember what, I can't use Google Chrome to access internet with this LAN connection. Please Help me.\n\nA: My suggestion would be to buy a router to connect to your internet that can be configured to connect with your username and password. That way, any computers behind the router will not have to authenticate to connect to the internet (except wireless passwords).  \n\nA: I hope I understand you correctly. If you go to system settings, then network, then make sure wired is selected on the left, then click on options on the right, you should be able to enter your username, password and any other details. I hope this will be useful.\nOh if you try it, make sure \"connect automatically\" is checked where you enter your details.\n\nA: I am guessing you are authenticating through a RADIUS server like we often see in public hotspots.\nTry to establish your connexion using Firefox. Then try your other applications. They should work unless a firewall blocks them.\n", "Q: Can Mouse Wheel Scrolling be enabled in Byobu I've seen elsewhere that scrolling via the mouse wheel (and other mousy events) can be enabled for tmux.. can this feature also be enabled in byobu (over tmux) and how?\n\nA: If you still have this problem,\nTry ALT + F12\nIn my case, this enables mouse scrolling on byobu\n\nA: If you just want scrollback and you don't want to engage the tmux \"mouse-mode\" (which will interfere with your ability to cut-n-paste with the mouse) just add the following to $HOME/.byobu/.tmux.conf\nset -g terminal-overrides 'xterm*:smcup@:rmcup@'\n\nNow your terminal's scrollback works normally and you don't need to hit any special keys to engage the mouse.  The drawback is that the terminal only knows about a single screen.  You'll still need to use \"mouse mouse\" to scroll a screen other than the most recent (such as to get to a long-scrolling log buffer), but if you just want to scroll up to see what just scrolled off your screen, this will fix it!  It doesn't know about split screens either.  BTW, the \"mouse mode\" can be set automatically in your config files.  You paste with your command key (usually Ctrl-A) followed by the ] key.  The mouse selection is cut automatically in mouse mode, but you'll have to get out of mouse mode or hold down Shift to get the usual clipboard behavior that allows you to paste into another GUI app.\nRecommendation:  Since byobu already uses multiple terminal sessions inside itself, you don't need to use it with multiple terminals.  So, instead of having a hot-key that opens a new terminal, I assign my \"open terminal\" hot-key to tilda.  Tilda drops-down from whatever workspace you are currently using (shows on all workspaces) and it stays running so it is always available.  This works nicely with byobu because I now have 1 place for all my shell sessions (you can set tilda to run byobu instead of a normal shell and re-run it if you accidently exit your shell).  Further, your terminal sessions out-last your GUI because you are using byobu.  I log into my system with ssh and automatically get my byobu session (great to monitor compiles, etc) and the byobu virtual window resizes to my cell phone screen.  When I reorient the phone, the byobu window on my desktop screen changes with the phone orientation - MAGIC!  Very impressive to Windows users.\nNext is to use enlightenment's terminal hacks to get a notification (from the GUI) when a terminal job finishes, but dbus permissions makes that iffy.  If anyone gets this working with byobu please let me know!\n\nA: Yes, this is possible.  You just have to enter scrollback mode first.\nSimply press F7, and then use your mouse scroll wheel.  Finally, press ESC to exit scrollback mode.\nIt appears that some terminals won't allow you to scroll using your mouse still. For Gnome Terminal, untick the Scroll on keystroke option in the profile preferences (tab Scrolling).\n\nA: Add below options to ~/.byobu/.tmux.conf:\nset -g mouse on\n\ndetail here\n", "Q: How to minimize a window using mouse in PCManFM?

Now there's just a blank screen between the menu and gdm login.\nHow do I coax Ubuntu 11.04 to display the boot activity?\nDale E. Moore\nOh yeah; I asked the same question here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1760753 and they didn't know the answer.\nThis question was asked here https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+question/160511 too, with no new insight.\n\nA: Grub is a boot loader, i.e. the software that is launched when the computer starts and whose role is to boot an another operating system. So, unless I have misunderstood, what you want is not seeing the messages from Grub, but instead you want to see the messages from Ubuntu itself during the boot process.\nGenerally speaking, what you have to do is to remove the \"quiet\" Linux command line option. However in recent versions of Ubuntu, this is not enough because the splash screen has not been designed to display activity. Therefore, you also need to prevent the splash screen from starting up, and you can do that simply removing the \"splash\" command line option.\nIn other words, you should edit some configuration so that your /proc/cmdline changes from:\nBOOT_IMAGE=/boot/vmlinuz-... root=... ro quiet splash ...\n\nto:\nBOOT_IMAGE=/boot/vmlinuz-... root=... ro ...\n\nTo do that, you need to set GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT in /etc/default/grub to an empty string:\nGRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\n\nWe are almost there: now you need to remove the so called gfxpayload and vt_handoff. While these two options improve the boot experience, they will also prevent your messages from being displayed. AFAIK, there are no options in /etc/default/grub that you can tweak for that, so you are forced to open /etc/grub.d/40_custom and add the following at the bottom of the file:\nfunction gfxmode {\n    set gfxpayload=\n    set vt_handoff=\n}\n\nSimple, but effective.\n", "Q: Terminal with tmux style screen splitting? Moving from OS X, loving Ubuntu so far.\nOne thing I'm missing is an iTerm 2 like terminal emulator that allows for easy screen splitting.  I could use tmux, but would like to be able to copy and paste between terminal windows and applications easily...which tends to be difficult in tmux.\nAny suggestions?\n\nA: You can do it in screen the terminal multiplexer.\n\n\n*\n\n*To split vertically: ctrla then |.\n\n*To split horizontally: ctrla then S (uppercase one).\n\n*To unsplit: ctrla then Q (uppercase one).\n\n*To switch from one to the other:  ctrla then tab\nEDIT, basic screen usage:\n\n\n*\n\n*New terminal: ctrla then c.\n\n*Next terminal: ctrla then space.\n\n*Previous terminal: ctrla then backspace.\n\n*N'th terminal ctrla then [n].

I think the one hosted on launchpad one is the one you want for your purpose though, and it's readily available in the Ubuntu Software Centre.\n\nA: Personally I'm finding that tmux+UXTerm gives me all the tmux-style screen splitting that I need. I can also \"copy and paste between terminal windows and applications easily\" - well, fairly easily, anyway.\nTo paste from the X clipboard, I need to remember to use shift+insert\nTo copy to the X clipboard, hold down shift while selecting the text to copy, then left-click when done. To paste that into another app, use shift+insert in the other app.\nThere's one area where this doesn't work perfectly: if I've got a vertical split and want to copy multiple lines. uxterm doesn't understand the split. To get around this I have \"bind-key z resize-pane -Z\" in my .tmux.conf; this toggles the pane between normal size and \"zoomed\" mode, where it occupies the whole window. C-b z makes it big, then I can copy, C-b z pops it back to normal size in the layout.\n\nA: I'm using xsel as my clipboard manager (it's in ubuntu package manager) and tmux as my terminal multiplexer and to copy to and from the two is as simple as pressing the bind key + < (to copy to tmux) and bind key + > to copy to xsel.\nIn my tmux.conf file i have these lines,\n\n\n*\n\n*To copy to tmux from xsel.\nbind-key < command-prompt -p \"copy to tmux (hit enter to confirm):\" \"run-shell 'tmux set-buffer -- \\\"$(xsel -o -b)\\\"'\"\n\n\n*To copy to xsel from tmux.\nbind-key > command-prompt -p \"copy to xsel (hit enter to confirm):\" \"run-shell 'tmux show-buffer | xsel -i -b'\"\n\nIt's that easy really.\n", "Q: What does udevd process do during the boot time?

For every device the kernel has detected and initialized, a directory with the device name is created. It contains attribute files with device-specific properties.\nEvery time a device is added or removed, the kernel sends a uevent to notify udev of the change. The udev daemon reads and parses all provided rules from the /etc/udev/rules.d/*.rules files once at start-up and keeps them in memory. If rules files are changed, added or removed, the daemon can reload the in-memory representation of all rules with the command udevadm control reload_rules.

So, I don't believe you can use separate workspace switcher in compiz. I don't know of any workspace switcher independent of window manager\n\nis it possible to use elementary's window manager instead of Compiz?\n\nNo. Elementary uses gala window manager.

I've been trying to solve the following problem for over a week without any sign of success so I hope there's a much more knowledgeable person here that can give me a solution.\nI have an early 2011 MacBook Pro (8,2) with Mac OS X running in a SSD. Then, instead of the Optical bay, I have a HDD in where I would like to install Ubuntu to run it natively.\nI've tried to do the normal installation process, with or without rEFIt, but it seems the problem resides on the communication between the device containing the Ubuntu .iso file and the laptop. It doesn't allow communication with the boot CD or USB drive. It usually says: “Loading bootlogo...” after I click on the “boot from CD, Linux Icon”.\nAfter trying several things, I would like to know if I could install Ubuntu on the HDD as an external HDD (using a friend's Window's system) and then simply put it back into my laptop so as to become an Internal HDD again. I guess, I would have to reinstall many drivers and so on, but would this approach work?\nThanks in advance and sorry for this huge block of text\n\nA: You are using a USB drive that has a mounted Ubuntu 12.04 image on it, correct?\nWhen you boot into the Ubuntu installer, the purple console based one, you will have an option to set some boot parameters. After selecting install language, you're greeted with a menu to try a live Ubuntu version, install, (and other stuff).

My problem is, how can I make rsync to switch to another harddrive automatically if space on the first one is full? Is there a simple way? Or even a way without using rsync? \n\nA: I don't think what you propose is achievable (with just rsync) and/or sensible. Rsync synchronises objects in two locations. You should probably think about solving this on a lower level.\nFirst of all, if this is how you back up your data, by splitting it randomly between two disks, you effectively double the chances of your backup becoming incomplete if one of the devices fail.\nIf you really don't care about that (depending on the data importance it might be a pretty bad idea), you could:\n\n\n*\n\n*remove partitions from both disks (I assume they're /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc)\n\n*use Logical Volume Manager (LVM) to create a volume group using those disks as Physical Devices. It would have be roughly the size of a sum of sizes of both disks\n\n*add a logical volume (or more) in this volume group\n\n*create a filesystem on it\n\n*mount it and use as the destination for your rsync copy.\n\n\nin short (I named the Volume Group 'vg10' and the Logical Volume within it 'backup'):\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=512k count=1\ndd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdc bs=512k count=1\nvgcreate vg10 /dev/sdb /dev/sdc\nvgdisplay vg10 # look for number of free physical extents\nlvcreate vg10 -n backup -l<number_of_free_physical_extents>\nmkfs.xfs -L backup /dev/vg10/backup\nmkdir /mnt/backup\necho \"/dev/vg10/backup /mnt/backup xfs defaults 0 0\" >> /etc/fstab\nmount -a\n\nKeep in mind that you'll need both disks connected to be able to mount /mnt/backup and that this doesn't give you ANY redundancy.\nI don't know your scenario but I'd go with at least a RAID1 setup for my backup.\n", "Q: How can I fix white characters on menus and the Launcher not disappearing?

Information about old assets, where to find them and the status of the replacements can be found here.\n\nA: You are right, it's a copyright issue, some more info can be found in:\n/usr/share/doc/blobandconquer-data/NEWS.Debian.gz\nblobandconquer (1.11-dfsg+20-1) unstable; urgency=low\n\nMusic, sounds and textures are non-free.\n\nEarlier versions of blobandconquer were released in Debian main with music,\nsound and textures, since it was though that they were in the public domain or\notherwise freely licensed. However, it was brought to the attention of\nupstream's main author that this was not the case for many files. The sound,\nmusic and textures files have been downloaded from various free online\nrepositories, such as (but not limitted to) modarchive.com. These repositories\nallow free use and redistribution of the files, but not necessarily\nmodification or commercial use. Therefore, the music, sounds and textures in\nBlob and Conquer are not DFSG compliant, and cannot be distributed in Debian's\nmain section.\n\nThe game should still be playable, and in the future replacements will be found\nfor the removed game assets.\n\n-- Guus Sliepen <guus@debian.org>  Sat, 21 May 2011 14:38:59 +0200\n\n", "Q: Package dependencies cannot be resolved I am using Ubuntu 12.04.

I have a 500 Gig external USB drive formatted as exFAT. I can not create an image from my 12.04 install to this drive with ReDo backup (I found out it lacks support for exFAT) . Note the image will be over 5 GIG so FAT32 is not an option for the external drive. \nIs there another free program I can use to make an image? (Gui would be best)\nNote I was able to add exfat support to 12.04 and can see the drive and add files manually as well as delete them.

If doing sudo apt-get install exfat-fuse doesn't work, then you might try first adding a repository as in the instructions at http://softwaroid.com/2011/12/20/how-to-solve-the-unknown-filesystem-type-exfat-problem/ .\n", "Q: Please Help..Dual Boot Question This is probably simple to explain/resolve but I need help with dual booting.\nI have win7 installed. I just installed Ubuntu. Before the Ubuntu installation, I took the necessary steps. Such as create new partition, assign for storage space and also swap space. Once, I started installation everything went smoothly. However, after confirming \"no\" to import settings from win7 to Ubuntu (such as mozilla firefox settings etc. for users) I restarted the computer to complete the install.\nNaturally, in a dual boot situation the PC displays which system to start (win7 or Ubuntu). I don't get this screen. It just boots directly to Ubuntu. I need to be able to choose either win7 or Ubuntu. \nAny help is appreciated, thank you.\nI know my win7 loader is in dev/sda1 and I think that I also updated the grub...PLEASE HELP\n\nA: You need to set timer in grub so when it loads you can choose which OS to boot. To do so follow this steps\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminal\n\n*In the terminal enter sudo gedit /etc/default/grub\n\n*Locate the line GRUB_TIMEOUT and set the value 10 for example. So it will look like this GRUB_TIMEOUT=\"10\"\n\n*In order to see the grub menu you have to comment the following line GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0. To comment a line you should add # at the begging. So it will look like this #GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0\n\n*Save the file and close it.\n\n*Then update the grub config by executing command sudo update-grub\nNow you should be able to see boot menu where is your Ubuntu and Windows listed.\n\n\nIn order to reinstall grub we are going to use tool called Boot-repair  Actual quote from Ubuntu community wiki\n\nBoot-Repair is a simple tool to repair frequent boot issues you may encounter in Ubuntu like when you can't boot Ubuntu after installing Windows or another Linux distribution, or when you can't boot Windows after installing Ubuntu, or when GRUB is not displayed anymore, some upgrade breaks GRUB, etc. \n\nTo repair GRUB follow these steps:\n\n\n*\n\n*boot your computer on a Ubuntu live-CD or live-USB.\n\n*choose \"Try Ubuntu\"\n\n*connect internet\n\n*open a new Terminal, then type:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\n\n*Press Enter.\n\n*Then type:\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\n*Press Enter\nUsing Boot-Repair\nRecommended repair\n\n\n*\n\n*launch Boot-Repair from either : the Dash (the Ubuntu logo at the\ntop-left of the screen) or by typing 'boot-repair' in a terminal\n\n*Then click the \"Recommended repair\" button. When repair is finished,\nnote the URL (paste.ubuntu.com/XXXXX) that appeared on a paper, then\nreboot and check if you recovered access to your OSs.\n\n\nHope this help to restore access to your systems.\n", "Q: How do I set up three monitors with 2x Nvidia NVS 300? I have got triple monitor setup, with two Nvidia graphics adapters. I wanted to set it up the same way as it is configured when I run Ubuntu under VMware - e.g. each screen allows to separately maximize one application.

Below is my setup - there is only single screen per adapter is configured right now (to nail down the problem - on single adapter with two monitors I am able to enable Twinview, but it is not what I am looking for).

I was wondering about support for Ubuntu in general.\nIf a small and or large business is running Ubuntu, what type of issues does Canonical help out with?\nexamples:\n\n\n*\n\n*if a business is running a windows app, via wine does canonical help\nout with that\n\n*when a business is running software that is not installed via the\nsoftware-center, but, via PPA(stable/beta) and or downloaded manually. Some\nexamples apps libreoffice/handbrake/openshot etc... etc... does\nCanonical give support when those app have issues?\n\n*when a business is trying to migrate from lotes notes/outlook to\nthunderbird?\n\n\nA: Canonical Support and Services will support you to some extent on all of these questions through our Ubuntu Advantage program, but there are some caveats:\nA1.  Wine is in the Universe repository, not Main, and is therefore technically \"unsupported\".  What that really means is that there are no guarantees that we can solve the problem or provide a patch.  We will, however, give it a good effort and assist in configuration questions and triaging the problem.  We have some really great support engineers but if it's not in Main, there are limits.\nA2.  Similarly, by definition PPAs are not part of the Main repository.  In some of the examples you've cited, there are suported packages for those apps in Main (e.g. libreoffice, openshot) so in such cases we would like to see if the same problem can be reproduced in the mainline Ubuntu version of the package.  You might use the PPA version of openshot, but if the same crash/bug exists in the mainline Ubuntu version, then there's no problem.  It will be supported.  However, if it results in a patch, we're going to push that fix into our packages in Main.  Getting the same patch into the PPA which you use would take some coordination with the PPA maintainer and is not guaranteed at all.  If that PPA is maintained by a Canonical employee, an Ubuntu member, or the package's upstream maintainter, then there is a decent chance, but again, no \nguarantee as these are not the offical Ubuntu archives or our Canonical Support PPAs.\nA3.  That's a broad question.  There are server-side email migrations and then there are client-side migrations.  Either way, it seems to me that this type of issue would not fall under Support but Services (i.e. consulting).  I would contact Canonical Sales and ask for an evaluation.\nSince you asked for details, let me add that there are several different types of Ubuntu Advantage subscription: desktop, 3 levels of server support (essential, standard, advanced), cloud guest, and cloud infrastructure.  Each choice comes with a client subscription for Landscape, our system management console.\nAnd you're only obligated to subscribe the systems that you think require support.  Every other system (test, dev, uat, etc.) can run the exact same distribution as your supported systems.\nGood luck, I hope we can help!\n", "Q: Eclipse with log error root@deepak:~# eclipse\n\n** (eclipse:28003): WARNING **: The connection is closed\nfind: `/root/.eclipse': No such file or directory\nfind: `/root/.eclipse': No such file or directory\nW: Cannot inject update-sites, cannot find the correct config.\n\n** (eclipse:28002): WARNING **: The connection is closed\n\n** (Eclipse:28002): WARNING **: The connection is closed\n\n** (Eclipse:28002): WARNING **: The connection is closed\n\n** (Eclipse:28002): WARNING **: The connection is closed\n\n** (Eclipse:28002): WARNING **: The connection is closed\n\n** (Eclipse:28002): WARNING **: The connection is closed\n\nsimilar when i try to logged in User then\n/home/deepak/.eclipse/org.eclipse.platform_3.7.0_155965261/configuration/1350065308917.log.\nlog message\n!SESSION 2013-10-12 23:38:28.737 -----------------------------------------------\neclipse.buildId=I20110613-1736\njava.version=1.7.0_07\njava.vendor=Oracle Corporation\nBootLoader constants: OS=linux, ARCH=x86, WS=gtk, NL=en_IN\nCommand-line arguments:  -os linux -ws gtk -arch x86\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi 4 0 2012-10-12 23:38:31.851\n!MESSAGE Application error\n!STACK 1\njava.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: Could not load SWT library.

This feature means that no partition can start at sector zero (0)\n\nSource.\n\nA: Colin Ian King's answer is correct; however, it should be noted that hard disks that use the Advanced Format feature (4096-byte physical sectors and 512-byte logical sectors) require partition start sectors to be multiples of 8 in order to get optimal performance. See this article I wrote for all the gory details. Most partitioning tools today (late 2012) align partitions on 1MiB (2048-sector) boundaries by default. Since 2048 is a multiple of 8, such partitions work fine with these disks. Most disks sold today, and certainly most of the larger models, use Advanced Format. Thus, unless you're certain that your disk does not use Advanced Format, it's best to align on 8-sector boundaries. Note that 34 is not divisible by 8; 40 is the smallest start sector for a GPT disk with a standard partition table size that works well with Advanced Format disks.\nWhat version of Ubuntu are you installing, Kent? I haven't checked recently, but I thought that the last version or two used 2048-sector partition alignment. If you're installing something older, you might want to consider installing a newer Ubuntu, since that will give you much more up-to-date software.\n\nA: If installed on a GPT disk, sector 34 is the first sector than can be used as sectors 0-33 overhead sectors used for the Protective MBR, the GPT header, and the GPT partition tables.  This is a reasonable answer as to why it starts at sector 34.\n", "Q: How I remove grub text in ubuntu3 version?

So you should try Ubuntu Desktop (common version) and make it run no desktop environment nor GUI at all in the boot.\nThis way, if you need to do something, you can simply start the GUI and your favorite desktop environment in order to do whatever changes/testing you need.\nIf you choose to install the server edition you may be able to use non graphical tools to admin your files/folders (midnight commander for browsing, nano, vim/emacs to edit files and a lot of useful text based tools).\nI can't provide any support for the remote administration account but if you install online services you can edit web files directly from your webpage. Check the eXtplorer project for file browsing/editing, phpMyAdmin for editing MySQL Databases and if you have a special need please drop a new question with such need in order to get the proper support.\nAs everything is running to be online (such as documents in web services, etc.) you should consider installing enough services that allow you to do whatever you need. There are services for editing your PHP, HTML, CSS and other popular files directly from the website so that you won't be in need to gain access to the server just to make small changes. However, you must consider to gather the proper support in order to have the remote administration account in order to be able to run powerful tasks directly on the server.\nWhat I mention is based on my own experience using a desktop web based server on which you can gain access to the files/folders and certain administration (like files/folders permissions, etc.) just by using web based services like those I have mentioned over here.\nGood luck!\n\nA: Try Lubuntu if you need a lightweight GUI!...

Thoughts? At work we have some high-end gaming laptops we use for their dual GPUs.  The machines have second generation i7 CPUs, and came with Windows 7.  On most of them I installed Ubuntu 10.10, and all was fine.  There were two laptops that I wanted to repurpose and wanted to reinstall the OS.  It boots the CD (burned Ubuntu installation CD, I've tried 10.10, 11.10, and 12.04, as well as CentOS 6), and when Grub tried to boot the kernel, I just get a cursor blinking in the upper left corner of the screen.\nI tried the disabling of ACPI and the other items in the advanced menu, but nothing works.  I could still boot to the current Linux installation though. I was able to install Windows 7 again, and use WUBI, but I think that works because it uses the Windows bootloader and not Grub.

Instead, install the linux-generic-pae meta-package, which will ensure that upgrades work correctly, and that supporting packages are also installed.\nSo what should I do? I do not want any problems. Also I've heard that kernel updates are problematic and I've received 6 of them.\n\nA: Kernel images are tested just like any other update so if they appear in the standard update list then, unless you have a very unusual system, they are safe to install. Kernel updates are only problematic if you have unusual hardware or are using an custom made kernel.\nThe standard kernel releases are usually built with SMP and PAE enabled.\nSMP (Symmetric Multi-Processing) allows software to use multiple processors or multiple cores, which many CPU's now have. If you have an older single core CPU, the kernel will simply switch of the SMP capabilities without a problem.\nPAE (Physical Address Extensions) allows a 32-bit process to map address to more than 4GB. If you don't have that much RAM then, again, the kernel simply doesn't use the feature.\nSince kernel upgrades often include security or bug fixes, if they appear in the standard software update list, then you probably do want to install them.\n", "Q: What's the easiest way to upgrade Ghostscript?

Partition Sizes? I'm about to reinstall Windows, so I thought that I'd try Ubuntu out on a partition just for fun. \nMy question is, how large should my partitions be for each of them? I know this various depending on what you use, so i'll give you a general idea of what I have, and what I have in mind.\nI'm currently running:\nWindows 7 Professional (64bit)\nRAM: 4GB\nCPU: 2.5Ghz Quad Core processor\nHDD: 500GB\nGPU: 1GB Nvidia GeForce\nI have around 130GB in Steam games, and some heavier applications like Photoshop CS6, Sony Vegas Pro 11. But other Applications I use are:\nChrome\nSkype\nDxtory\nFraps\nOpenOffice\nBitTorrent\nand other assorted smaller programs. \nSo, I was thinking that I would give my Windows partition about 150-200GB, my Ubuntu Partition around 20GB, and the rest to shared storage. I'm not really sure if I'd need more or less on Ubuntu, because I've never used it and I'm not really sure what kind of apps i'd be using over there. \nThis would also be a clean install, so I'd be wiping my HDD, creating the Partitions in GParted, then installing Windows with Ubuntu following that. \nAny critique you could give me? Maybe explanations to what the /root, /boot and /home partitions I hear are about?\nThanks in advanced if you actually read this lengthy thing! Any help is appreciated. (x\n\nA: Okay, you have 500 Gig hard drive space to start, and you are definitely going to give Windows at least 150-200 Gig?\nI'd actually say to give Ubuntu anywhere from 35 to 50 Gig, if you're planning on using it a lot. As for the file sharing, Ubuntu can access the Windows partition as if it were an attached hard drive (you get read-only access if Windows is hibernated, though,) and it's not implausible to access your Linux partition from Windows (I haven't tested it, but I assume that the Hibernation restriction goes both ways.)\nIf you're okay with Ubuntu messing around with the Windows partition, and you don't mind having an extra program on Windows, then I would actually recommend allocating 300 or so to Windows, and the other 200 to Ubuntu.

Flash support for Linux is still lacking. Older hardware often performs only poorly when trying to watch youtube videos.\nThere are several external players  (VLC, mplayer, minitube) that alleviate this problem by offering video playback without flash. But none of them support parsing Youtube playlists out of the box. \nIs there any way I can play Youtube playlists without having to rely on flash?\n\nA: It turns out there is:\nPlaying Youtube playlists using a playlist parser script for VLC\n\nInstallation\nInstructions as per the source:\n\n\n*\n\n*download the script (or copy it and paste it in a new file with the \nname playlist_youtube.lua)\n\n*move the file to ~/.local/share/vlc/lua/playlist/ (current user) or \n/usr/share/vlc/lua/playlist/ (all users)\n\n\nUsage\nOpen up VLC and hit CTRL+N to display the Open \nNetwork Stream dialog. Paste your youtube playlist link into the text field \nand hit Enter. Make sure the link you copied contains the youtube  playlist identifier (list=PLxxx).\n\nNote: This script relies on VLC's inbuilt youtube parser. As youtube \nchanges its system now and then, video playback in VLC might suddenly stop \nworking. In that case you will have to update your youtube parser script. \nYou can do so with the following commands (credit goes to phoibos):\nsudo apt-get install curl\n\n(makes sure curl is installed)\nsudo rm /usr/lib/vlc/lua/playlist/youtube.*\n\n(removes old parser)\nsudo curl \"http://git.videolan.org/p=vlc.git;a=blob_plain;f=share/lua/playlist/youtube.lua;hb=HEAD\" -o /usr/lib/vlc/lua/playlist/youtube.lua\n\n(downloads new parser)\n", "Q: Switch different language pairs with separate key combinations I use 3 different languages on my laptop, but most of time I need only 2 of them, so switching with Ctrl+Shift is quite annoying.

Can I delete one to make room for ubuntu? I'm trying to install ubuntu right now, and I've run into a problem. I have Windows 7 installed on my SSD, and I want to install ubuntu on my HDD, but I already have three partitions on my HDD. The partitions are two Recovery Partitions and one data partition. What I don't understand is why my data drive(the HDD) has recovery partitions for Windows 7? The same recovery partitions(or atleast I think they are the same. Same sizes, same names, same order) are on the SSD with the Windows 7 install. Can I safely delete the recovery partitions on the HDD? \nMy other option, I think, is to put the boot partition for ubuntu on the SSD where I only have three partitions. Then I can put the other three logical partitions for ubuntu in an extended partition on the HDD. Can I do that, put the boot partition on one drive and the other partitions on another?\nHere is a picture of the partitions and I have circled the one I would like to delete to make room. \n\n\nA: When you did the initial install you disconnected the HDD drive and did a clean install on the SSD is this correct?  The reason I asked is that I want to do essentially the same thing.\nDo you program files operate correctly now?  Or did you have to move the data files to the SSD to get them to work.\nI do agree with what you said initially is that the new install of Windows 7 actually created your new recovery files on the SSD like any new install.\nTo address the part about ubuntu OS, you can set up a dual boot partion if you have the acronis tools.  According to the new software update you can install as many operating systems as you would like to put on your partition.\nI have used it to clone a whole disk to disk copy and it worked great.  But you will have to purchase Acronis 'Disk Director to do any major stuff but its worth it.\nI hope that helped with your question.

(2)\n\nI tried to resolve this by:\napt-get install -o APT::Immediate-Configure=false -f apt python-minimal\n\nBut this simply ended up with this last list of dependency errors:\napt: Depends: ubuntu-keyring but it is not going to be installed\n       Depends: libc6 (>= 2.15) but 2.11.1-0ubuntu7.11 is to be installed\n       Depends: libstdc++6 (>= 4.6) but 4.4.3-4ubuntu5.1 is to be installed\n       PreDepends: dpkg (>= 1.15.7.2) but 1.15.5.6ubuntu4.6 is to be installed\n  apt-utils: Depends: libapt-pkg-libc6.10-6-4.8\n  libapt-inst1.4: Depends: libc6 (>= 2.14) but 2.11.1-0ubuntu7.11 is to be installed\n  libapt-pkg4.12: Depends: libc6 (>= 2.15) but 2.11.1-0ubuntu7.11 is to be installed\n                  Depends: libstdc++6 (>= 4.6) but 4.4.3-4ubuntu5.1 is to be installed\n  libc6: Depends: libc-bin (= 2.11.1-0ubuntu7.11) but 2.15-0ubuntu10.2 is to be installed\n  libept0: Depends: libapt-pkg-libc6.10-6-4.8\n  libnih-dbus1: Depends: libnih1 (= 1.0.3-4ubuntu9) but 1.0.1-1 is to be installed\n  python: Depends: python-minimal (= 2.6.5-0ubuntu1) but 2.7.3-0ubuntu2 is to be installed\n  python-apt: Depends: libapt-pkg-libc6.10-6-4.8\n  python-minimal: Depends: python2.7-minimal (>= 2.7.3) but it is not going to be installed\n                  Breaks: python-support (< 1.0.10ubuntu2) but 1.0.4ubuntu1 is to be installed\n  synaptic: Depends: libapt-pkg-libc6.10-6-4.8\n\nAny ideas on how to dig out of this hole?\n\nA: I also had the python-problem and then lots of unmet dependencies. At last, after finding out that the real problem is in apt, I just did:\ncd /var/cache/apt/archives\ndpkg -i apt_0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.16_amd64.deb\n\nThe following apt-get -f install installed all packages, that didn't work before and the following apt-get dist-upgrade (nearly) worked like a charm. \nBut after this mess of an upgrade with the do-release-upgrade-script from 10.04 to 12.04 and similar problems on other Ubuntu release upgrades, I took the decision that any new systems definitely won't have Ubuntu any more, but the good, old, stable and reliable Debian, with which I never experienced such problems!\nHope this helps You too ! \nBest wishes - Ralph from Germany\n", "Q: How do I run Sim City 4?

Sorry for the long question, but the situation/desire is quite complex. Here is my setup: I have a laptop which I carry around everywhere and I have a desktop sitting at home, connected to the internet through a router using NAT. \nMy objective is to create a connection from my laptop to my desktop that can allow me to (in order of priority):\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the desktop as a proxy server\n\n*Access files on the desktop remotely\n\n*Control said desktop from the laptop using VNC or similar.\n\n\nNow here is the scene.

I recently discovered that my computer is 64-bit. I have backed up my Home folder, and reinstalled Ubuntu.

I always get the Beta builds, but I want to take advantage of the 64-bit architecture of my computer. this page says that Mozilla has come out with a 64-bit version of Firefox, but I can't seem to find it.\nI do understand the ramifications of using a 64-bit browser, but I've decided to jump right in and do it anyway.

And by chance I could plug it again and everything worked fine. In my case an USB hub was guilty.\n\n\nA: Wow, this seems tough. I'm not 100% sure whether this will help or not, but you might want to consider trying out the xorg-edgers' PPA. It's highly experimental, BUT they might have just the driver you need. (They had the driver for my graphics card, a Radeon HD 4350, which was previously getting ZERO hardware acceleration.) The one downside is that the packages build on each other, so you need the whole PPA just to get one little driver. :/\nANYWAY, this is not for everyone, but if you either love beta/experimental builds, or are very desperate, then this might be worth a shot.\nTo use this PPA, then press CTRL+ALT+T and type:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\n\nOR, if the Terminal makes you queasy, go to your Update Manager (or Software Center,) choose Edit>Software Sources.\nThen, choose the Other Sources tab and choose Add....\nType deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/xorg-edgers/ppa/ubuntu precise main and click Add Source. Now, click Close and go back to the Update Manager.\nClick Check, let it finish, and then click Install.\n", "Q: Tweeter destroyed by ultra high volume. Any kind of protection? I was listening to a music track at a moderate volume through HDMI out and I guess I had turned the volume in the application down quite a bit and had the receiver turned up. An ad movie in my browser randomly started playing at a super ultra high volume and blew out a tweeter in my $1000 speakers.\nIs there any kind of software protection for this kind of thing in the future? I'm using all stock drivers in 12.04.1 with the recommended NVIDIA proprietary drivers, although it doesn't seem like the NVIDIA driver is controlling the sound through the HDMI out. \n\nA: Hmm, I don't know at the moment if there's any software that will help with this, but since you said that an advertisement started blaring at full volume and blew out your speakers, I'd recommend using an adblocker for the sites that have ads with sound. (One of my favorites for Firefox is Adblock Plus.)\nThis will also indirectly punish sites that have loud ads, as they will lose the revenue from the blocked ads. This is an unintended but nice consequence. ;)\n\nA: The short answer is perhaps: yes, but not one you'd want. IMO there are two ways around this problem:\n1. Apply dynamic range control\nProbably what you were thinking of here. This would apply dynamic range control (e.g. a limiter) across your (entire) pulse output. I've not tried this (for reasons see below) but I'd venture your best route would be a LADSPA plugin, as per this answer. Once configured, any transient bursts in volume (over the threshold level) should cause a reduction in volume (by a ratio) on the output meaning your tweeters should get saved. Note that this almost certainly won't apply to Dolby or DTS audio e.g. from a DVD / BluRay on the PC.\nOf course, the problem is when it kicks in during that sudden bit in the film, or a big crescendo in a symphony. Essentially all (aggressive) dynamic range control is horrible for music (with certain notable exceptions), so I'd highly recommend against it here especially as you have (had?!) decent speakers. So the other option...\nor: 2. Make sure the spikes don't happen\nThis may sound naïve but there is some mileage in this route. Whilst traditionally engineers often recommend the (power) amp stages be left on maximum, leaving volume control nearer the source, in a digital setup there is often greater variance in input volume.\nPersonally, I'd recommend leaving all but your final master volume control on or near maximum, especially any application ones (e.g. movie players, music programs). Final volume control can be with the master control, or perhaps better still using your amp's control.\nAdditionally, as you may already know, using pavucontrol (available in Ubuntu repositories). You can tell Pulse to have the system sounds much quieter, and as shown you can also configure the volume for your browser plugins to be lower than your music players', which is generally a good idea, especially if you use ReplayGain (also a good idea...). These really does limit the \"surprise\" element of those types of web ads (typically delivered by flash, which comes under plugin-container), and also events out the blarey youtube effect.\n\nWith careful tweaking you should be able to set your system up in a way that will minimise the risk of this ever happening again.

I learned about the ad-hoc network, but I am unable to create an ad-hoc network on my macbook pro 6'2 with ubuntu 11.10, so i need an alternate method.\n\nA: The wifi router will work regardless of whether you have internet. So, both laptops will be connected using the router as a common link. So, to ssh to one of them you'd use something like ssh 192.168.1.2. Of course, replace the IP address with the IP address of the laptop you're connecting to. You might ditch DHCP and use static IP addresses for them so that one laptop is always 192.168.1.2 and the other is always 192.168.1.3.\n\nA: I haven't tried this before, but here's what you can do -\nFirst install an ssh server on the laptop you whish to ssh to.\nFor ubuntu type this in the terminal -\nsudo apt-get install openssh-server\n\nAnd for the other laptop -\nsudo apt-get install openssh-client\n\nType ifconfig on your server laptop to find out its ip address.\nYou can then connect to you server -\nssh (server IP)\n\nYou can add static IPs to both of your laptops so that their addresses don't change!...\nHope this helps.\n", "Q: GRUB not recognising copied partition I've been following the instructions on this page to copy my Linux partition from one partition to another on the same drive.

Therefore, use the device ID when mounting:\nsudo blkid\n\nThis will show you a list of devices along with their UUID's, which determine the devices in a unique manner:\n/dev/sda1: UUID=\"395b2e65-af41-4026-8492-d6f17b08ad8b\" TYPE=\"ext4\" \n/dev/sda5: UUID=\"db9e00d0-afe9-4386-95c1-a11a13324932\" TYPE=\"swap\" \n/dev/sda6: UUID=\"11842584-3992-47c8-81a8-ac1aa498ce2d\" TYPE=\"ext4\"\n\nInstead of /dev/sda1, for example, you can access them then by ls /dev/disk/by-uuid/395b2e65-af41-4026-8492-c6f17b08ad8b, which is maybe more obscure, but better.\n", "Q: Looks like a font is missing Nautilus has become like this:\n\nGlobal menus now have this ugly font.\nAny idea why?

Apparently it does I-printing as well. I can't find a straight forward driver for CUPS so this leads to a number of questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Does anyone have any experience with the machine?\nRecommendations?? and/or alternative? \n\n*Does it require HPLIP?\n\n*How does HPLIP compare to CUPS?\n\n*Do they conflict? ie. must I remove CUPS?\n\n\nAny advice is sincerely welcome.\n\nA: \nI can't find a straight forward driver for CUPS\n\nWhat have you tried?\nMy friend just got an HP OfficeJet 6600. He's got Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS. He uses a direct USB connection to the printer though--he doesn't print over the network. He is not using the fax or scanning features (yet).\nCups is working for him, so it does not require HPLIP. He hasn't tried HPLIP (to my knowledge), so I can't say how it compares. I'm not sure if they can both be installed at the same time.\nThe Ubuntu printer setup GUI (Dash or System Settings → Printers → Add) helped him set it up. The driver that appears to be working for him is \"HP Officejet 6500 e709n hpijs, 3.12.2\". Note that this was not the default/recommended one in the printer setup GUI.\nHPLIP claims to support scanning and other features. Seems like you could just try:\nsudo apt-get install hplip-gui\n\nThat uses KDE, so if you've got a stock Ubuntu (and not, for instance, Kubuntu), that will install a ton of KDE/Qt packages. But it should work. And you shouldn't have to worry about conflicts, the package maintainers have presumably worked that out for you.\nIf you don't want all the extra KDE/Qt packages, here's what I'd recommend.\n\n\n*\n\n*install the hplip and hplip-cups packages\n\n*reboot, then add your printer\n\n\nIt might just find the right driver and start working.\nUnless you need color and rarely print, I highly, highly recommend any laser printer over any inkjet printer. You'll pay much less on toner than you would on ink over the life of the printer. In general I stick with Brother lasers because their GNU/Linux support seems solid. I use the MFC-8840D. Network printing and scanning work ok with the MFC-8840D.\n\nA: I had the same issue and could not find information that would help make the scanner work.\nI installed the hplip-gui package as suggested above.  My only note is that it did not detect my printer.  I \"manually\" detected by entering the IP address.  \nAfter finding and configuring the printer, \"simple scan\" detected my printer and enabled scanning!\n", "Q: How to test other DE in Ubuntu 12.10 live (alpha) \nPossible Duplicate:\nThere’s an issue with an Alpha/Beta Release of Ubuntu, what should I do? \n\ncaution: 12.10 is not yet released but I was told it will say as is also when release happens (live session)\nSo, new ubuntu live session does not have option to \"logout\" and choose different desktop environment (DE).\nThis function was usable if one installs ubuntu live on USB stick with permanent changes.

I have an encrypted loopback volume. I need to mount and umount the volume manually, so I use cryptsetup luksOpen and cryptsetup luksClose .\nHowever, under all sessions (gnome/xfce/kde/unity), when I invoke this command it pops up the /dev/mapper device  ...\nAnd then it lets the one user mount (with password), access files, and unmount the volume.\nIt's quite annoying in a multi user server (you are working on your files and the volume is being unmounted). I want the volume to be owned and used by only root and the owner and not all users.\nHow can I define ownership and permission on the device ? \nMore informations :\n\n\n*\n\n*I've tried chown and chmod approach witch gives nothing. \n\n*Cryptsetup doesn't have any options that let you do that.\n\n*crypttab auto mount the filesystem on boot witch is unwanted (only manual mount)\n\n\nThe permissions that cryptsetup put in the /dev/mapper/MyEncryptedVolume is owner root:root but with lrwxrwxrwx\nwhatever I do (like a chmod) won't do anything. \nIt's a device (/dev/mapper/MyEncryptedVolume) that is linked to /dev/dm-0 with rights brw-rw----\nI've changed the rights of /dev/dm-0 with udev rule but nothing change : the volume is still shown to normal users due to the symbolic link.\nThank you\n\nA: The reality is that Cryptsetup uses Loop devices / Losetup in order to mount a loopback file to /dev/mapper/MyEncryptedVolume.\nudev can resolve the situation.\nThere is two options : let cryptsetup choose the loopdevice or dedicate a loop device for this.\nI chose the second part.\nIn this example I use /dev/loop5\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a file named 99-myspecial.rules into the folder /etc/udev/rules.d/\n\n*insert this :\nKERNEL==\"loop5\" MODE=\"0600\" OWNER=\"MyUser\" GROUP=\"MyGroupUser\" ENV{UDISKS_IGNORE}=\"1\" ENV{UDISKS_PRESENTATION_HIDE}=\"1\" ENV{ID_DRIVE_EJECTABLE}=\"0\"\nThis tells udisk (witch is the real trouble maker in that situation) to ignore the volume, to hide the icon, that the volume is not ejectable (aka it's not a cdrom). You also specify that only one user can access to that volume.\n\n*Then Restart udev service\n\n*Then I link the loop device like this :\nlosetup /folder/myflatfile.img /dev/loop5\n\nAnd then I use cryptsetup as I want with the loop device as source.\nHopes that helps someone more than me.\n", "Q: Does 'Owning' A Directory Or File Give You And Special Permissions? I've read a little about chmod and have a high-level understanding of file permissions.  But I'm a little confused about the concept of an 'owner'.\nIf my user account is the 'Owner' of a directory but it has no permissions (chmod 0000) does my user have any more ability to do anything than another random user on the system?  Assuming neither user is a super user?\n\nA: chmod 00000 makes the directory/file inaccesable to owner and group. The only thing you and the group that owns the file can do is remove it with rm -rf tmp/. Nothing better than an example:\n$ mkdir tmp\n$ chmod 00000 tmp\n$ cd tmp\nbash: cd: tmp: Permission denied\n\nYou can see the directory with ls -l \nd--------- 2 rinzwind rinzwind   4096 Oct 13 14:35 tmp\n\nand but only with sudo  permissions can you enter the directory ...\n $ sudo su\n # cd tmp\n #\n\n\nRegarding the other posts: yes you can remove a file/dir that is chmodded to 00000:\n$ mkdir tmp\n$ chmod 00000 tmp\n$ rm -rf tmp/\n$ touch 1\n$ chmod 00000 1\n$ rm 1\nrm: remove write-protected regular empty file `1'? y\n$ \n\n\nAs the owner you are also allowed to reset the permissions. That is something someone else (except for root) is allowed too.\n\nA: A directory is just a special kind of file so the following applies equally to directories and files.\nBeing the owner allows you to reset access to the file so that you can then read the file.  Other than root, other users won't be able to do so. \nUntil you reset the access the file will be inaccessible to you the same as it would be for other users.\nBeing the owner of the file does not allow you to remove (delete it).  You must have write access to the containing directory to remove it.\nExample script demonstrating what can and can't be done.  (Don't run as root, but requires sudo access.):\n#!/bin/bash\n\nDIR=directory$$\nFILE=$DIR/file$$\n\necho We can remove it - own both file and directory\nmkdir $DIR\ndate > $FILE\nchmod 0000 $FILE\nls -ld $DIR $FILE\nrm -f $FILE\nls -ld $DIR $FILE\necho\n\necho We can not remove it - no write access to directory\ndate > $FILE\nchmod 0000 $FILE\nchmod -w $DIR\nls -ld $DIR $FILE\nrm -f $FILE\nls -ld $DIR $FILE\necho\n\necho We can remove it - even if we do not own it\nchmod 0000 $FILE\nchmod +w $DIR\nsudo chown root:root $FILE\nls -ld $DIR $FILE\nrm -f $FILE\nls -ld $DIR $FILE\necho\n\necho We can not remove it - even if we can read it - do not own directory\ndate > $FILE\ncat $FILE\nsudo chown root:root $DIR\nls -ld $DIR $FILE\ncat $$FILE\nrm -f $FILE\nls -ld $DIR $FILE\necho\n\nsudo chown $LOGNAME $DIR\necho Now we can clean up\nrm -f $FILE\nrmdir $DIR\n\n# EOF\n\n\nA: Yes. As the owner, you can use chmod to give yourself whatever permissions you need. \n\nA: \nIf my user account is the 'Owner' of a directory but it has no permissions (chmod 0000) does my user have any more ability to do anything than another random user on the system? \n\nThe simple answer is, No, the owner won't have any other facility for being owner of the directory when it is chmoded to 0000. Because the permission bit for owner is also 0, which means no read/write/execute permissions for him.\nCheck the Linux file permission bit\n", "Q: Localhost still exist after deleting xampp After installing xampp, somehow localhost bugged on me.\nI put my files, changed permissions, in the end deleted the xampp, but I always get this message:\n\nIt works!\nThis is the default web page for this server.\nThe web server software is running but no content has been added, yet.\n\nWiped the folder, tried restarting either, there's no xampp but I'm still getting it, what's the problem?\n\nA: You probably installed a webserver using the Software Centre.

It's still out there for someone willing to write a bash script!\nEdit 4: Although the bounty has been awarded to a good answer which I encourage you to upvote, I am still seeking a more concrete answer. If it also elegantly handles virtual packages provided by one or more packages, then I'll possibly give another after-the-fact bounty to award that answer.\n\nA: You could always have apt list all the dependencies then by hand you could install the packages that you would rather install but I've searched man pages and several forums but I could not answer your exact question other than rewriting the source to apt that's how opensource works anyways.\n\nA: As far as I know, there is no way to optimize that. Most things are already greatly compressed, so you don't download nearly the whole file size.

They covered it quite a bit deeper than I did, so if you're still having trouble or my answer didn't solve your problem, I'd recommend taking a look at that thread. \n\nA: I think you're confusing how dependencies work. If something is dependent- then by definition it is needed. I suppose what you could do is find out exactly which files from the dependency the app you want is using... and remove everything that it doesn't call.. but that seems like a lot of work for a few megabytes.. \nYou seem to be asking for a car that will still drive missing a 4th wheel(let's say the 'back-left', for the sake of this metaphor),to save on weight.

Can anyone help?\n\nA: maybe you already solved the problem, but... I am also having weird problems with my mic, it works normally most of the time, but once during the skype phone call, it just muted, the other person didn't hear me at all. I tried everything, pulse audio, alsamixer... but what finally helped was, even though it is weird, to unbalance the INPUT volume in pulse audio control - now the right (or left) mic is 100% and the other one is 0. And I disabled skype to set automatically the volume of the mic...the disbalancing is suggested in here Microphone not working at all in Skype \nhope this helps \n", "Q: Is 'userspace virtual filesystem - backends' necessary during installation of Gimp? Because this add-on is selected by default in the Software Center. What it actually do?\n\nA: The package in question is gvfs-backends. This is used by Gnome for various tasks--mounting remote and local resources in a way that any program can mount them. Due to the way the backend functions, these locations and resources can be mounted by non-root users. However, this package is not a dependency. It is only suggested, as per http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/gimp. You can safely install GIMP via the terminal without installing gvfs-backends by\nsudo apt-get install gimp\n\nsince apt-get does not install suggests. If you want to also skip recommends(not recommended if you want PDF, PS, and ghostscript support), you can install with:\nsudo apt-get install gimp --no-install-recommends\n\n", "Q: How to revert VLC media player to its original state? For the last few days, my VLC media player has not been responding at all.

How do I make VLC media player back to its original way so that I can access any file through VLC media player?\n\nA: You can reset your VLC media player settings by renaming your current VLC media player configuration folder.  Execute the following command in a terminal:\nmv ~/.config/vlc ~/.config/vlc.old\n\nIf VLC media player  still does not open correctly you can try reinstalling VLC media player:\nsudo apt-get remove --purge vlc\nsudo apt-get install vlc\n\nBefore running VLC media player , make sure it is not still running:\nps ax | grep vlc\n\nThis should not return anything.

A few months ago I converted an old desktop computer into a basic server by putting Ubuntu (desktop version) onto it and setting up apache2, etc.  I have SSH configured so that I can work on it remotely, and use FTP to move files.  When I tried to access my server yesterday I found that it was down, and I could not get in at all.  I'm at college, and my server is at home, so I called my mom, who told me that there had been a brief power outage at my house, and I concluded that my server had restarted.  I have the computer set to require a password on startup, so it turns out that it had just been sitting at the log in screen for the past few days, waiting for a password.  My instinctive question is whether SSH or some other program can be used to log the system in (as if in person) from a remote computer after the server has been restarted.\nAs I said, I currently have the computer set to require a password to log into the one and only user account on the server upon startup.  When I SSH or FTP, I use the same log in/password, though I'm guessing that I'm going to be told that this is the wrong way to go about doing it, and is the source of my problem.  In that case, what would you recommend?\nThanks in advance.\n\nIn response to the comment and answer, I don't know what the X environment is, so it's probably not something that I want to log in to. The way I have the server set up, when you physically turn the machine on, it boots up, and then asks for a password, just like most normal computers do. You have to enter the password in order to get to the desktop and run applications.  From my experience, the web server application, ssh server application, etc. are not active until the password is entered and the desktop is loaded.  Hence, I need to log in to the computer in order for it to come on line as a server.  What I need is a way to get the server running again (at desktop, with apache) after the machine loses power and boots back up without having to physically enter a password in person.\n\nA: Based on what you said, this sounds like you are using a BIOS boot password vs just the desktop logon password.\nCase in point, I have a laptop in my home that is old much like yours, however, the ssh service is fully active and I don't need to log into the remote desktop. Doesn't matter how many users are present on the system. SSH is a service that will run in it's own process separate from the X environment.\nMy recommendation is that you remove the BIOS boot password and allow your computer to boot normally. That way you can access it remotely regardless of whether you have logged on to it physically.\n\nA: Edit: In response to comment, just as an alternative idea... you could create a second very non-privileged user that is allow to auto log on. This would get the needed services running. \nBefore I get flamed, yes there is a \"potential\" security issue in adding an auto log-in user. But not much more than adding an additional user period. Heavily restrict this user's access, give it a solid password, and have the screen auto lock and require a password after a very short time out. Then you should be able to log-in using the original answer. \n-----Original-----\nUse the -X option with the SSH command\nExample $ssh -X 192.168.1.100\nAlso check out the man page for SSH to look at more options. \n man ssh\n\n", "Q: How do I get https web interface in Transmission? I use Transmission's Web Interface, but I don't feel comfortable using it remotely (outside of LAN, e.g., from a friend's house) due to the lack of any sort of encryption. The idea of broadcasting my Transmission Web Interface login details, wholly unencrypted, across the internet just doesn't appeal to me for some reason. (I'm kinda paranoid about that. I even installed a browser plugin to enable HTTPS on any site possible.)\nI've heard of, and even attempted, a few of the convoluted tutorials involving lighttpd, but I haven't had any luck so far.\nI just want to be able to use some sort of encryption for the Web Interface, so I can manage my torrents remotely. What do I need to do?\n\nA: I would recommend to install a simple web server such as nginx and make it proxy to port 8080, which would allow you to add authentication, SSL and other servers in the future if you would so please.\nTo configure nginx to forward things to 8080 you can write this in the /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default file:\nlocation / {\n  proxy_pass        http://localhost:8080;\n}\n\nKeep in mind, that this will work only for the web interface and not if you want your torrent port to be 80.\nTo add SSL support you need to create a key and a signed certificate (I assume you don't want to have it signed by a CA, so here's how to self sign it):\nopenssl req -x509 -nodes -new -keyout <name>.key -out <name>.crt\n\nThe default server config file (same one as above) should have this contents:\nserver {\n    listen 443 default_server ssl;\n    ssl_certificate     /etc/nginx/test.crt;\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/test.key;\n    server_name  default;\n\n    access_log  /var/log/nginx/localhost.access.log;\n\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass        http://localhost:8080;\n    }\n\n    error_page   500 502 503 504  /50x.html;\n    location = /50x.html {\n            root   /var/www/nginx-default;\n    }\n}\n\nYou need to match the key and certificates locations to the ones you just created, and in your browser you will get an untrusted warning unless you import your certificate (or pay for a commercial one).\nAfter making those changes in the config you should run:\nsudo reload nginx\n\nor\nsudo /etc/init.d/nginx reload\n\n\nA: There is a command line interface for transmission called transmission-remote-cli that you can use after you ssh into your server. This is what I use. Works like a charm. I'm sure easier https sollutions will come up in the future if you're not up to configuring a proxy.\n\nA: Tunneling with SSH is, of course, one possibility, but maybe an easier solution -- easier to set up and easier to carry around on a stick -- is to use an ssh client (putty if you are on Windows, for example), log in to your machine and use a text browser (w3m, links). \nThat way, you need not even to open up your ports to anything but the local machine.\nThis may not provide a perfect graphical interface for browsing, but it sure is sufficient for many administrative tasks; in fact, I find it often more convenient to use even if I can use my regular browser for it.\n", "Q: Volume control via media keys in xubuntu I noticed that the volume control when I use xubuntu is not really working properly. \nI can see, that xubuntu is recognizing that it should do something and displays a small image indicating volume up/down or mute. But, it is not affecting the sound I hear for instance while using youtube.\nWhen I open my PulseAudio I see in Output Devices Tab two devices: Built in Audio Digital Stereo and Built-in Analog Stereo. The indication for sound volume for the first device actually does react when I press the media keys for volume up/down. But this should be the second device that should be controlled by my media keys. So the question is, how do I change the device controlled by media keys?\nAlso, I noticed, that under Ubuntu the media keys work fine, and it is possible to control volume with them..\n\nA: I had the same trouble. The advice on this page fixed it for me:\nhttp://ulno.net/2011/04/16/mixer-control-with-multimedia-keys-und-multiple-soundcards-in-xfce4-on-debian-or-ubuntu/\nIn short:\nSettings -> Settings Editor\nFind the section xfce4-mixer.\nSet the value of property active-card to the same as the value of sound-card.\n", "Q: Open folders with Google Chrome instead of the default file manager I'd like to set Google Chrome as the default application for opening files on Ubuntu. How can I change the default file manager to Chrome, instead of Nautilus (which I believe is the default file browser?)\n\nA: You have to edit the mime-types. Open /usr/share/applications/defaults.list search for directory.\nChange the value  nautilus.desktop to google-chrome.desktop\nBut Chrome wont provide you the rich features provided by Nautilus. \n", "Q: Why does it take so long for my USB speakers to be recognized by pulseaudio? I have an XBMCBuntu installation (based on Ubuntu 11.10), meaning that I don't have a graphical desktop environment installed.\nI've connected a set of USB speakers, and for about a minute or two, running pacmd list-sinks yields only one sink:  my laptop's onboard sound card.\nAfter about 3 minutes, running the same command yields both the original sound card and the USB speakers, at which point I can run pacmd set-default-sink alsa_output.usb-1130_USB_AUDIO-00-AUDIO.analog-stereo and play sound out of the peripheral speakers.\nUnfortunately, the changes brought forth by the pacmd set-default-sink command aren't persistent across reboots.  I suspect that this is because pulseaudio falls back on the onboard sound card when it can't detect the USB speakers for those first three minutes.  Of course, I'm not really sure that this is the case, but it begs the following questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*Why does it take so long to detect the speakers;  Is there anything I can do to speed things up?\n\n*Is there a way of making these changes persistent other than scheduling a cronjob to run pacmd set-default-sink alsa_output.usb-1130_USB_AUDIO-00-AUDIO.analog-stereo after a few minutes of uptime?\n\n\nThanks!\n\nA: We have no solution for the long timeout your system needs to recognize an external USB sound device but there is a way to connect the Pulse Audio output sink with this device as soon as it was available (as loading a default sink in your default.pa is not possible when the device is not ready by the time the sound server is started).\nPulseaudio module-switch-on-connect enables automatic switching of an audio device on connection. To test if this works we may issue the following commmand in a terminal:\npacmd load-module module-switch-on-connect\n\nOn success we may add the following line to our /etc/pulse/default.pa\nload-module module-switch-on-connect\n\nto always load this module per default.\nNow the Pulseaudio output sink should be switched to any newly connected sink, in your case this would be your USB audio device.\n", "Q: Why won't Kubuntu load my CD?

I have about 1TB available for Windows 7, PC starts from Ubuntu as default.\nResult was two primary partitions in Ubuntu, 890 GB and 16 GB. Ubuntu OS resides in partition 16 GB.\nThen I installed software OpenFoam and it was installed in partition 890 GB. I cannot use it as it stands.\nWhat would you advice? Reinstall Ubuntu? Use GParted ? I already have a boot CD for GParted.\n\nA: Actually, having two partitions -- one small for the OS and a large one for /home and the data -- is a very good idea. Instead of merging the partitions, I would rather move my /home from the smaller partition to the large one, and mount the large one as the new /home.\nThere are at least two very good reasons for that. (i) reinstalling the system does not increase heart rate, as chances of incidentally wiping out your data by allowing the installer to format the partition are smaller (ii) smaller partitions tend to have better access times.\nIf you really, really want to merge, however, then you do this: \n\n\n*\n\n*move all data from one partition to another\n\n*delete the partition from which you have moved the data\n\n*expand the remaining partition with gparted\n\n\nIt doesn't matter which partition is first, as long as they are next to each other.\n", "Q: How to mount a network drive? I'm trying to set-up a home file server. I'm thinking about just setting it up as an FTP server, no particular reason other than I'm familiar with FTP and samba tends to be very frustrating. \nBasically the set-up I'm going for, is to be-able to create multiple user accounts for the server and restrict or allow access to specific folders on each user. FTP is the only way (that I know of) to accomplish a set-up like that. \nHow can I mount an FTP server as a drive in Ubuntu so that all my applications can access it just like any other driver or folder. An example would be downloading 12.10 via torrent when it comes out, I would like to be able to tell transmission to just download the file straight to my ftp server. I know how to do this in Windows, its actually very easy. But I cant figure it out in Ubuntu. I have tried using the \"connect to server\" option in nautilus, and it works, but it doesn’t give me the result I want, most applications don’t see the folder, while others can. \nAlso I am open to options other than FTP if anyone has any suggestions.

Then after all is said and done I would still need a way to mount the shares as a drive in Ubuntu. \nThe ability to mount network drives in windows is one of my favourite features, but seeing how Ubuntu is now my daily OS and has been for about 4 years, I really need a way to accomplish the same thing in Ubuntu. Also a GUI would be preferable, seeing as there will be multiple people using this server, I would like it to be as easy as possible.\nEDIT: this link here seems to be almost exactly what I'm wanting to do, if I could find a GUI that can do this ill be almost set. then I would just need to find a way to hide specific folders from certain users.\n\nA: sudo apt-get install curlftpfs\n\nin terminal mount ftp resource:\ncurlftpfs [user@]host:[dir] mountpoint [options]\n\nor in /etc/fstab:\ncurlftpfs#ftp.host.com /mnt/host fuse rw,uid=500,user,noauto 0 0 \n\n\nA: OK, i found it easy.\n 1. Go to desktop when logged in Unity.\n 2. Click on the top bar and select 'file'\n 3. Select 'Connect to server'\nI think it is, what you are looking for.\n\n\nA: For mounting a networkdrive I use Smb4k. This program scans the network, it allows you to mount a map.  It wil create in your homefolder a folder smb4k with subfolders/\nFor example: i have a iomega media network drive with several maps on it like music, video and a backup location. \nFor adding the music collection to a music player you go to /home/user/Smb4k//music. \nFor creating a backup with deja dup choose for the backup-location: > local folder: >\n/home/user/smb4k//back-up/dejadup\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/smb4k/\n\nA: If you have ssh to this device you can use sshfs IP:(folder to mount) (point to moint) eg.: sshfs 1.1.1.1:/ /media/drive1\nI don't know way to do it via ftp.\n\nA: I found a program in the software center called Gigolo, it does exactly what I want as far as mounting the shares on boot. As far as the shares being available to all applications, there is a folder called \".gvfs\" in the home folder, I created a bookmark in nautilus to that folder, then named the book mark what ever I wanted. These two things allowed me to do exactly what I wanted to do and it was pretty painless. \n", "Q: Broke my sudoers password, how do I reset it without using sudo? I thought it would be a good idea to finally take the password off my little netbook since it has never actually been of any use, and has mostly just slowed down . But when I went to change my password, there wasn't even an option to make it blank, and any attempt to make it a few easy characters was met with \"Password too weak\".\nSo I did what any good geek would do and popped open the terminal, read the manual entry for passwd and quickly used the -d option to remove the password from my account. It all went well for a couple days (I even managed to also make my keychain password blank) until I tried to update the thing.\nMy sudoers password is not blank, and it's not my old password. I have no idea what it is. How do I reset it (or even better, make it blank) without the use of the sudo command?\n\nA: Go to terminal type who am i then type passwd and enter the password you want.\nYou will be able to use that password to change your password on user accounts.\n\nA: If you messed up your sudoers file, you'll need to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot into recovery mode (hit escape during boot, choose the recovery mode option on the grub screen)\n\n*Choose the 'Enable networking' option (if you don't your filesystem will be mounted as read-only. who knew)\n\n*Chosee the 'Drop to root shell' option\n\n*Run visudo, fix your file\n\n*Reboot with normal grub option\n\n\nsource :- http://mario.net.au/content/recover-etcsudoers-ubuntu-1204\n\nA: You can install linux on machine without losing data . only be carefull aboout that use same username . if you want really cracking password i will look for it\n\nA: After switch on your PC , you will see GRUB menu .

Whenever they are used inside the java console, they produce something like this:\n^[[A ^[[B ^[[C ^[[D\n\nThey work fine on the rest of the system, though.\nI have already tried several things like checking system-locales or setting specific locales for java only but without any luck. Any ideas what's the reason behind it and how it could be fixed?\nThanks in advance.\nedit (Oct 29):\nAfter reading the first answer and testing several things, I figured out some more about this issue. There is now program running on top of the shell, the issue is mostly caused by problems with java's jline library that is used by the java application (or its console, to be more specific).\nFor testing purpose I switched to from OpenJDK6 to OrcaleJDK6 and the issue was gone. Testing OpenJDK7 is not possible as there is no version for 10.04.\nI assume some connections with jline since this is the library responsible for handling console out- and input. Probably the version used by the application is somehow incompatible with the older OpenJDK version used on the server. But compatible with the more up-to-date version of oracle-java I installed manually.\nI still have not figured out how ubuntu's jline-package fits into this picture. For me there is no difference between testing with and without it.\nWill edit this post again if I figure out something. If anybody has an idea, please let me know.\n\nA: Some console programs (it may be a program running on the top of the bash, such as sh ) do not suppress the control key presses such as Up ↑ arrow or down ↓ arrow etc. In those consoles, You will also get the echo of the key presses like you posted ^[[A ^[[B ^[[C ^[[D. It's not a big problem actually. \nYour default shell is bash which suppresses the key strokes of arrow keys. Unlike bash, the sh shell doesn't suppress the arrow key strokes. You can try it by running sh on a terminal and pressing the arrow keys. To exit from those consoles, you need to use certain command specific to the programs, most of the time, it is quit or exit. In your case of a minecraft server, it would be stop.\n\n\n*\n\n*Some interesting information can be found here\n", "Q: Boots up into Terminal I am running a 64 bit version of Ubuntu 12.04.1, and I when I boot up, I am thrown (Rather violently. :P) a full-sized terminal, instead of my lovely GUI login screen..

I am not sure what to do, and I am not very familiar with ubuntu. Help please\n\nA: You will want to use the Something Else option. On the choice on how you want to use your disks, pick Something Else.\nFind the 200 GB partition and click Edit after highliting it by clicking it. In the Use As field, set it as Ext4, and check the Format checkbox. Set the Mount Point to /. You will be confronted with a warning about swap. I rarely use it, but if you have little RAM, you may want to make your 200GB partition a bit smaller and  add a partition in the free space with the Use As option set as Linux Swap.\n\nA: Based on the information you gave:\n\n\n*\n\n*/dev/sda1 is a Windows 7 bootloader\n\n*/dev/sda2 is probably an OEM recovery partition\n\n*/dev/sda3 is The 400GB Windows 7 paritition\n\n*/dev/sda4 is the 200GB extra partition where you can install Ubuntu\n\n\nUnder Windows this is probably accessed as D: drive.  Only proceed if you have not used it and there is nothing in the drive, else backup whatever data you have put there.\nYou can then proceed as Robert has said in his answer.\nIf you want to have a swap partition however, things are a little more complicated because the manufacturer (OEM) has already used up all four primary partitions that it is possible to have.  The way around this is to delete /dev/sda4 completely and create an extended partition in its place.  You can then have two logical partitions within this extended partition - One for Ubuntu / (root) and one for the swap file.\nTwo reasons why a swap partition is desirable:\n\n\n*\n\n*Swap partitions are used for hibernation.  If the computer is a laptop and you want to be able to hibernate rather than suspend, you'll need a swap partition.  Hibernation saves the current state of the computer on the swap partition and then powers down completely.  Suspending only powers down peripherals but maintains the computer state in RAM, therefore it still uses some power.  It's possible to suspend your computer and leave it longer than expected, only to find that the battery has gone flat.  Hibernation is suitable for when you want to leave the computer for longer periods, or if you are not sure how long you will be away from it.\n\n*Swap partitions can be used as RAM if things get tight.  If you only have a small amount of RAM (usually 1GB or less) then a swap partition can be helpful, to keep a bit more RAM available for system use.\n\n\nI have the following suggestion which will get you installed in the easiest manner, with a swap file.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot off the LiveCD or LiveUSB and Select \"Try Ubuntu\"\n\n*When booted, run Gparted and delete the /dev/sda4 partition. Make sure you click the button to commit the change to disk otherwise it will not actually delete the partition.\n\n*Click \"install\" to start the installation\n\n*When asked, select \"install alongside Windows\"\n\n\nSince there will be blank unformatted space Ubiquity (the installer) will make an extended partition on which it will then make the / partition and a swap partition and install Ubuntu accordingly.  If you want to do a more manual operation you can create the Extended partition, and then create the logical main partition and swap partition inside it if you wish, but the end result will really be the same.\n", "Q: How to access the menu of the webapp using HUD?

For testing I want to create a mirrored (RAID 1) partition with a size of 1GB on /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc. When it comes to partitioning, I want to used parted, how should I create the partition I want to mirror?\nI start by initializing the partition table:\n(parted) select /dev/sdb\nUsing /dev/sdb\n(parted) mklabel gpt\nWarning: The existing disk label on /dev/sdb will be destroyed and all data on this disk will be lost. Do you want to continue?\nYes/No? Y\n(parted)\n\n\n\n*\n\n*After the above steps. How do I create the partition and set any necessary flags?\n\n*I know that raid is a possible partition flag, do I have to use it? How is it used by the running system?\n\n*Which file system type should I use? None?\n\nA: Start Parted using -a optimal to make sure it warns you in case you are creating a partition which is not correctly aligned. Create the partition without specifying any file system using mkpart:\nmkpart primary 1MiB 512MiB\n\nThis command creates a 511MiB partition starting at 1MiB and ending at 512MiB.\nUse MiB, GiB or TiB when creating the partition. This ensures correct alignment on HDD's with 512B as well as 4096B physical sectors.\nAbove 1MiB is used as the starting position, as it's the lowest position you can use without Parted complaining about alignment. But make a mental note that sector 40 really is the lowest position with correct alignment, but parted likes 1MiB boundaries and you're wasting very little disk space.\nTo make the kernel notice the RAID partition and mount it automatically you need to set the raid flag. If your new partition is identified as partition 1 in Parted (check with p) you set the raid flag using:\nset 1 raid on\n\nVerify the partitions sizes with print, but set unit display to KiB, MiB, or GiB. If you do not, the default compact units will show KB, MB and GB.\nunit MiB\nprint\n\nTo sum the answers up:\n\nI know that raid is a possible partition flag, do I have to use it? How is it used by the running system?\n\nNo you don't have to. In case you choose not to you have to mount it yourself.\n\nWhich file system type should I use? None?\n\nYes, don't specify one. Parted is moving away from handling file systems, the stuff relating to filesystems at the moment should be avoided.\n", "Q: need a different backup solution I just built a new media/backup server using Ubuntu 12.04 64bit. I installed a hard drive to be used only for music, pictures, and videos and formatted it fat32 so my 1 and only Windows PC could map those folders as netshares. My laptop, also running Ubuntu 12.04, is what I am using the most so new media is first downloaded on my laptop. I've already got the music, videos, and pictures folders from my server mounting as shares on my laptop on boot thanks to some fstab edits and sshfs. Now I'm wanting either an app or script that could backup any new files I add to my local media folders to the mounted folders on my server. I've been Googling all day and found a few apps like rsync but they seem to have issues with ext4 to vfat backups. I thought maybe a script would be best but I'm new to scripting in Linux and don't want to mess anything up.\nBasically I am looking for something that will backup only newly added files to the server. I figure I could schedule it once a week. There are some stipulations. For example, my local music folder has over 700 folders for each artist/band then sub folders inside those for albums. I want something smart enough to only copy newly added content so I'm guessing the modified date would probably be a good condition if I were scripting. I'm rambling.\nAny suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated. I'm not finding anything to suit my needs. I'm almost to the point of just learning bas scripting so I can write something but then it will be a couple weeks or so before I have a possible solution and I'd like something in place sooner.\n\nA: Firstly, your reasons for making the share directory FAT are erroneous. Only the computer mounting the drive or partition needs to be compatible with the filesystem.  After that it is just a network resource.  If you want to store larger files (example Movies) then you've just shot yourself in the foot because the maximum file size under FAT32 is 4Gb.  Your library is much better off on a journalling filesystem like ext4 for reasons of reliability, usefulness, and speed.\nrsync does work fine writing to FAT partitions - I do it all the time as some of my pendrive backups are FAT.  You do lose all the owner and permissions information though, since FAT has no way of storing this information, but it's a moot point however, since I'd recommend you drop the use of FAT32 for your mass storage device.  Look at the -av switches for rsync - ie\nrsync -av ~/Downloads/Movies/  /Path-to-Destination/Movies\n\nWhich will work exactly as you want it to.\n\nA: Ubuntu One comes packaged with Ubuntu. You could log into both computers with the same account, and all data would be synced between the two computers. It's cross platform, with the new beta for Mac. You get 5GB free, then more on pricing can be found here.\nIt may not be a free solution if you need more storage, but it's very effective, and it also makes your files web accessible.\n\nWhat is Ubuntu One?\nUbuntu One is the personal cloud that brings your digital life\n  together, so you can enjoy your content, your way, wherever you are.\n  With our suite of cloud services including storage, sync, sharing and\n  streaming - you have immediate access to your music collection,\n  favorite photos, videos, important documents and more, at any time and\n  from any device.\nUbuntu One is easy to install and easy to use – everyone gets our sync\n  services and 5 GB of storage for free, and if you pay a little extra,\n  you can add Music Streaming and Storage to suit your own needs.\n\nSource: https://one.ubuntu.com/about/\n\nA: I agree to @Kyle Macey's answer.\nNevertheless, for a Backup purpose it is important to have some additional and helpful features of which I suggest to have the possibility to bring back something that was deleted in the past. Feature that I haven't found yet in Ubuntu One and that Dropbox has already solved since the very beginning of their service.\nUbuntu One and Dropbox keeps in sync several files/folders between computers, but if you accidentally or intentionally delete a file/folder, Dropbox will keep it in the list to be undeleted. Feature that I haven't yet found in Ubuntu One and that became SO IMPORTANT for me and if you run a search on \"how to recover data\" right here you'll see that there are at least 5000+ questions related, so it is not my personal need but vox populi.\nBoth Ubuntu One and Dropbox they are awesome for backing up and sync both  but, meanwhile I have recommended both Dropbox and Ubuntu One to several friends, they accepted to install only Dropbox since it is easier and faster to configure in several operating systems other than Ubuntu. This situation resulted in my current Dropbox available storage increased up to 8.5GB meanwhile my Ubuntu One remains in the original 5GB.\nBoth Ubuntu One and Dropbox offer paid services but let's face it. Dropbox is easiest to use.\n\nTake a look to ownCloud (http://owncloud.org/) and similar software list (http://alternativeto.net/software/owncloud/)  that includes Dropbox and Ubuntu one. ownCloud is an easy to use self hosted cloud which I have used in the past.

I changed it in my account and again I've to change it in another standard account. I don't know any way to change it in login screen. Also when shutting down that black screen with some commands also appears in 1440x900. I don't know why Ubuntu force itself to be in 1440x900. I want 1024x768 in whole way.\nI don't know whether it is required but I have Intel chipset 128 MB.\n\nA: To give you specific answers:\nEither the kernel or the X video driver (for most modern machines the kernel) queries your monitor to find out what resolutions it supports, tries to figure out which one is preferred (most of the time the highest resolution the monitor says it will do, for most modern graphics devices using kernel mode switching, this is done in driver/gpu/drm/drm_edid.c). The kernel or X then sets that mode as the default. You see the rest of the modes in the output from xrandr. Most people prefer the highest resolution their device will do. \nThis EDID communications is a two way transaction over a couple of the wires of most modern video cables, including HDMI. It doesn't work for hookups using only composite video cables, for example.\nSo the quick answer to your title question is that your monitor says it can do 1440x900 and both the kernel and X tell it to do so. I don't know why Windows chooses a lower resolution mode.\nAssuming your xrandr output says you have a mode called \"1024x768\" you can do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Modify the grub linux line you boot from to add video=1024x768@60. That overrides the kernel's choice. You may also have to delete the \"gfxmode\" line in grub, or modify it to 1024x768. You should interrupt the boot process at the grub menu and press e to edit the choice you want to use. I got this working on my test system (which sets gfxmode to \"text\" because I don't use the splash screen). You only need to change this if you really care about the resolution of those shutdown messages.\n\n*Add the following to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-resol.conf:\n\nSection \"Screen\"  \n    Identifier      \"Default Screen\"  \n    SubSection \"Display\"  \n        Modes         \"1024x768\"  \n    EndSubSection  \nEndSection\nYou can use gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-resol.conf to do this.\nThat will restricts lightdm and the desktop from start with any but the mode you want. lightdm will start X which respects the mode this file specifies.\n\nOnce you have all this working you can add \"video=1024x768@60\" to the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX line in /etc/default/grub. You may need to uncomment and set the GRUB_GFXMODE line to \"1024x768\" as well. After making changes to /etc/default/grub you need to run sudo update-grub to put them into effect for the next boot.\nAgain, this isn't needed for lightdm or the desktop, only for the shutdown messages, so you may only want to go through with item 2.\nIf you are trying to get larger, more readable text there are probably better options available.\n\nA: Modern LCD monitors have a thing called \"native resolution\" - a resolution where a single pixel in the video adapter's memory corresponds to a single triplet of red, green and blue screen elements. Any resolution apart from the native one is approximated using the monitor's hardware, which results in a blurred picture, jagged edges and overall dramatic drop in picture quality, even when switching to the resolution very close to the native one. I suspect that your monitor's native resolution is 1440x900.  \nOlder CRT monitors were much more analogous in this sense and allowed a wide range of resolutions to be displayed with about the same degree of clarity (or blurriness).\nNow you can see that the whole non-native resolution support thing is an artifact of the way old CRT monitors worked, and is going to be less and less important (try switching resolution on your Android phone, for example).\nIf you want to change the resolution to make the fonts bigger, a better option would be to make fonts bigger using Gnome configuration tools.\nIf you want to proportionally scale the whole desktop, you can look at using xrandr - this at least will give you a nice anti-aliased scaling. \n", "Q: Downloading langage packs makes the installation process take a long time. \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I remove the Translation entries in apt?\nHow to disable the download of language packs while installing Kubuntu\n\nWhen installing while connected to the internet, downloading language packs can take a long time.\n\n(original message) :\nWhy mandatory install slow load huge Language Pack.Native user\napplaud.Chosen at install already practical.Window install on request\nonly.\n\n\nA: I have to agree.

Install time should be 20 minutes or even less depending on the speed of your computer.\n", "Q: Wireless isn't working on Lenovo T400 This problem started after upgrading to 12.04, an my system is 'up2date' \nHave tried most of the solution-proposals found on the net.\nlspci -nnk | grep -iA2 net \n\n00:19.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Intel Corporation 82567LF Gigabit Network Connection [8086:10bf] (rev 03)\n        Subsystem: Lenovo Device [17aa:20ee]\n        Kernel driver in use: e1000e\n--\n03:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 5100 AGN [Shiloh] Network Connection [8086:4237]\n        Subsystem: Intel Corporation WiFi Link 5100 AGN [8086:1211]\n        Kernel driver in use: iwlagn\n\n\niwconfig\n\n>lo        no wireless extensions.\n\n>eth0      no wireless extensions.\n\n>wlan0     IEEE 802.11abgn  ESSID:off/any  \n          Mode:Managed  Access Point: Not-Associated   Tx-Power=15 dBm   \n          Retry  long limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off\n          Encryption key:off\n          Power Management:off\n\n\nsudo lshw -C network\n\n\n*-network\ndescription: Ethernet interface\n  product: 82567LF Gigabit Network Connection\n  vendor: Intel Corporation\n  physical id: 19\n  bus info: pci@0000:00:19.0\n  logical name: eth0\n  version: 03\n  serial: 00:22:68:1a:c4:75\n  size: 100Mbit/s\n  capacity: 1Gbit/s\n  width: 32 bits\n  clock: 33MHz\n  capabilities: pm msi bus_master cap_list ethernet physical tp 10bt 10bt-fd 100bt 100bt-fd 1000bt-fd autonegotiation\n  configuration: autonegotiation=on broadcast=yes driver=e1000e driverversion=1.0.2-k2 duplex=full firmware=1.8-3 ip=192.168.2.154 latency=0 link=yes multicast=yes port=twisted pair speed=100Mbit/s\n  resources: irq:29 memory:fc000000-fc01ffff memory:fc024000-fc024fff ioport:1820(size=32)\n*-network DISABLED\n  description: Wireless interface\n  product: PRO/Wireless 5100 AGN [Shiloh] Network Connection\n  vendor: Intel Corporation\n  physical id: 0\n  bus info: pci@0000:03:00.0\n  logical name: wlan0\n  version: 00\n  serial: 00:26:c6:6c:2d:24\n  width: 64 bits\n  clock: 33MHz\n  capabilities: pm msi pciexpress bus_master cap_list ethernet physical wireless\n  configuration: broadcast=yes driver=iwlagn latency=0 multicast=yes wireless=IEEE 802.11abgn\n  resources: irq:30 memory:f4300000-f4301fff    \n\n\nPlease help\n\nA: network DISABLED\n\nIndicates your wireless radio killswitch is still active.\nRun\nsudo rfkill list\n\nto see what the current state is. \"Soft blocked\" can be unblocked using a command:\nsudo rfkill unblock all\n\n\"Hard blocked\" means you'll have to find the switch on your notebook to unlock it.\n", "Q: Share files - Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7 - one network - password not accepted I ask this question in SuperUser but no one helps me.

I have had some problems with passwords on Windows-Ubuntu shares, so you might want to consider doing this without password, but set the share as read only so your files cannot be modified or deleted remotely.  \n\nA: If you install samba, you can share files Ubuntu as Windows. And if there isn't shared folder, you can't connect to the other computer. \n\nA: Did you try to disable the Windows 7 network password? I have managed to connect+transfer some files from a Windows 7 workstation to Ubuntu 12.10 64bit. \nLike you said, I couldn't see Linux in the network from Windows 7, but was able to see the Windows PC from Linux and I also was able to access to Windows shared files. One more important thing: After I transfered files from Linux to Windows PC [read+write shared folder], the files transfered with success, but Windows were unable to open/read them. \nI think its a file-permission issue.

Just simple way to prevent your guest from accessing your folder. If i got any wrong here, please let me know.\n\nA: *\n\n*If you mean the files in /home, you're right. The default folder permissions are 755 (readable and executable/accessible by others).\nYou can change the default permissions for all new folders by editing the file /etc/adduser.conf - Find the line...:\nDIR_MODE=0755\n\nTo block others, change it to:\nDIR_MODE=0750\n\nTo also block people in the same group (see ls -l /home) change it to:\nDIR_MODE=0700\n\nChanges will take effect when you create a new user.\n\n*You can also change the default umask value - edit the file /etc/login.defs:\n\nThe default umask 002 used for normal user. With this mask default directory permissions are 775 and default file permissions are 664.\nThe default umask for the root user is 022 result into default directory permissions are 755 and default file permissions are 644.\nFor directories, the base permissions are (rwxrwxrwx) 0777 and for files they are 0666 (rw-rw-rw).\nIn short,\nA umask of 022 allows only you to write data, but anyone can read data.\nA umask of 077 is good for a completely private system. No other user can read or write your data if umask is set to 077.\nA umask of 002 is good when you share data with other users in the same group. Members of your group can create and modify data files;\n  those outside your group can read data file, but cannot modify it. Set\n  your umask to 007 to completely exclude users who are not group\n  members.\n\nSource: http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/understanding-linux-unix-umask-value-usage.html\n\n*You can change the default file/folder permissions (i.e. when you create a new file) of a specific folder by using these commands:\nchmod g+s /folder/mypath  # set sticky bit \nsetfacl -d -m g::rwx /folder/mypath  # set group to rwx default \nsetfacl -d -m o::000 /folder/mypath  # set other\n\nVerify the change:\ngetfacl /folder/mypath\n\nSource: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/1314/how-to-set-default-file-permissions-for-all-folders-files-in-a-directory\nhttps://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-desktop-74/applying-default-permissions-for-newly-created-files-within-a-specific-folder-605129/\nFor clarification, the /root folder is by default set as non-readable:\n$ ls -ld\n/root drwx------ 9 root root 4096 Jul 27 19:00 /root\n\n\n*You can instantly change the permissions of existing files/folders using the chmod and chown commands, described here: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-use-chmod-and-chown-command/\nSame effect can be accomplished by right-clicking on a file/folder > properties > permissions\n\nA: Prevent seeing and accessing your folders and files by other user accounts:\nGUI:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Nautilus (file explorer)\n\n*Select your home folder (/home/your_name)\n\n*Right click, Properties and open tab \"permissions\"\n\n*You will see options for Owner, Group and Others.

You have to set permissions for users by using folders' properties. But this should be done by default that No One Should Access Administrative's personal files!\n\nA: For your personal home folder, (You should have ownership) - click the home folder icon at the top of the navigation bar on the left. - navigate up one tier to the /home folder-  you should see a folder with your name on it.-  Right click on that folder and select \"Properties\". -  Select the \"Permissions\" tab. -  From here you can select what access you want people in your group, or others to have to the files in this folder. - You can also check the \"Apply these permissions to contents\" box to apply these same permissions to the rest of the folders and files in your home directory.\n\nYou may want to encrypt your files. That is entirely up to you. If you choose to encrypt your files, look in the software center for some options.

Is there anyway I can manually get it to boot the USB stick from the GRUB command line or something similar? \nI've tried both Startup Disk Creator and UNetbootin.\n\nA: You can boot the USB from grub prompt if you want. While you are on grub, press C to bring grub command prompt. Then type these commands. (I'm assuming your USB drive is /dev/sdb1).\nroot=/dev/sdb1\nlinux /casper/vmlinuz file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu.seed boot=casper  quiet splash --\ninitrd /casper/initrd.lz\nboot\n\nAfter typing the boot, hit Enter to boot from the USB. It should load the Live environment and you should install now.\nYou can also directly boot from the iso image without even extracting the files.

I did sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade on a laptop last night but it did not upgrade up to the latest release as I expected.  What do I need to do?   \nIn other words:  why did it do a partial-upgrade instead of a release-upgrade?\n\nA: You can force to upgrade the release with:\nsudo do-release-upgrade\n\nFrom 11.04, it will upgrade to 11.10 I think and you do it again to upgrade to 12.04.\n\nA: I've been using do-release-upgrade on multiple machines through several Ubuntu versions and I've been really happy with the results. A few additional steps have made it even more useful for me.\nI often am upgrading remotely and would like to hop into the box being upgraded and check on the progress. You can use \"screen\" or, my preference, \"tmux\" to disconnect a remote session then \"tmux a\" to re-attach and see what's going on.\nJust one more point worth mentioning; I frequently am an early adopter using the new version before it's released. Use \"do-release-upgrade -d\" to upgrade to a development version of Ubuntu.\n\nA: I have upgraded from 10.04 to 12.04.1 LTS with no problems, simple preferences, and some of the settings may need to be reintegrated; however, for the most part, the OS upgrades without any problems, so as long as you have connection to the internet for when the installer needs something from the net.\n\nA: apt-get update updates the package manager cache of what packages are available.  apt-get upgrade upgrades packages that are already installed to newer versions.  Neither upgrades to a new release.  For that you need to either use the gui update manager, or do-release-upgrade.\nYou also can not skip releases except from LTS to LTS, so you must first upgrade to 11.10, then to 12.04.\n\nA: You can use the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS installation CD to upgrade from 11.04. Boot from the CD, choose \"install Ubuntu\" and it should recognize your 11.04 install and ask if you want to upgrade to 12.04. I just did this and it worked flawlessly.\nMy previous attempt had been to try using the command line (do-release-upgrade) going to 11.10 (successful) and then again to 12,04 (unsuccessful).\n", "Q: I get an error when I try to mount a disk to more that one mount point When I try and mount a disk to two mount mounts I get the following error:\nMount is denied because the NTFS volume is already exclusively opened.\nThe volume may be already mounted, or another software may use it which\ncould be identified for example by the help of the 'fuser' command.\n\nHow do I prevent this message from displaying?\n\nA: You cannot mount an NTFS volume in two places. This is by design to avoid FS corruption. You can, however, make a symlink from one location to the other.\nLet's say you mount it at /mnt/ntfs1 and want to make a second mount point at /mnt/ntfs2. You can symlink /mnt/ntfs2 to /mnt/ntfs1 as follows:\nsudo ln -s /mnt/ntfs1 /mnt/ntfs2\n\nNote the order in which the directories are given. The one where it is successfully mounted is first, and the place where you want to \"mount\" it is second.\nNote that this is imperfect as using cd .. in shells will cause you to work within the wrong copy, but for file management programs, this should work, with one caveat,  from here:\n\nNOTE: There is the danger of a file becoming corrupted if more than one person tries to edit it at the same time. \n\n\nA: A safer way than symbolic links IMHO:\n\n\n*\n\n*Mount the first mount like you used to do it\n\n*Create empty directories where you want the additional mount points to be, and mount to the additional mount points via the --bind option, for example:\nsudo mount --bind /media/windows /home/your_user/windows\n", "Q: How can I set the date format to my country setting? I am German, but I use only English software. Hence, I am also using English Ubuntu. It's not because I don't know how to install German Ubuntu. It's because I prefer to work with English software environment. However, I would like to keep date & time format in German format, just as I use a German keyboard layout in English Ubuntu.\nI can set the time format to 24h time. But how can I set the date format to German time format? It is irritating for me to have the day number before the time numbers:\n\nIn other words, instead of \"Oct 14 15:16\"\nI want it to display \"14 Okt\"\nor (if only English language is available) \"14 Oct 15:16\"\nor \"14th Oct 15:16\".\nAt least, the number of the day should be displayed before the month. In Windows, it was no problem to choose time/date/currency settings according to a chosen country.\nWhere can I do this in Ubuntu? \nThe best would be if I could freely enter the date/time format myself with variables (DD.MM hh.mm.ss etc).\nI found answers for Ubuntu 11.04, but not for Ubuntu 12.04.\nI am using Ubuntu 12.04, 64-bit.\nKeep in mind that I am a beginner. So I'd like to be able to do this via GUI, if possible.\n\nEDIT:\nI found the answer in a forum.\n\n\n*\n\n*Go to System Settings... and choose Language Support.

From terminal do \nsudo apt-get install dconf-tools\n\nFind it through Dash by writing dconf open it and goto Com > Canonical > Indicator > Datetime and from there you can change the format.\n\nLogout and Login for changes to take effect. \nThe default format is %l:%M %p , you will change it to %M:%l %p\n\n\nA: You can change the date and numbers display according to your country in Settings > Language support (not sure about the exact wording of this option as my version is not in English).\n", "Q: DVD-drive detected by BIOS and UEFI but not by Ubuntu 12.04 I have build a new tower containing;\nAsrock Z77 extreme4                     (motherboard)\nCore i7                                 (processor)\nHitachi LGE-DMGH 12 L (B) GH15F SATA    (SATA DVD-drive)\nProblem is;\nBIOS and UEFI has no problems detecting the DVD-drive but\nit is not detected by Ubuntu 12.04.

Has anyone else tried this in an 11.10+ version, and did software center work for you?\n\nA: Ok I think I found it here\nThe site to download from is http://packages.ubuntu.com\n\nInstalling the Broadcom STA (wl) driver\nUbuntu: you’ll need to download the following\n  packages (choose your Ubuntu release, architecture and mirror): dkms,\n  patch,\n  fakeroot\n  and bcmwl-kernel-source.\n  After you’ve downloaded the .deb files, use a USB flashdrive or some\n  other means of file transfer to get them on the computer you want to\n  install to. Then, just double-clicking each file should bring up\n  Ubuntu Software Center and let you install it. Then just navigate\n  to System > Administration > Additional Drivers (or Hardware\n  Drivers for older releases) and activate the Broadcom STA driver.\n  Check out this\n  page for more information about online installation, but please\n  note that the offline installation instructions are pretty much\n  outdated for wl. Important note: if this fails,\n  use Keryx (0.92, not\n  1.0) to do an offline upgrade and install the bcmwl-kernel-source package. An up-to-date Keryx tutorial is on my to-do list.\nOther distributions: you can compile the STA driver\n  yourself. 32-bit\n  .tar.gz, 64-bit\n  .tar.gz, readme.\n  The readme explains how to compile the drivers pretty well, so I’m not\n  going to do that here.\nsource\n\n", "Q: usb sticks and cards have all become read only For no apparent reason my desktop machine running Ubuntu 12.04 suddenly will not allow me to write to or create files/folders on any usb drive (memory sticks and cards).

It seems that the command works fine on Ubuntu 32bit desktop, but on Ubuntu amd64 (Desktop) the command sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade tells me that I need to uninstall a lot of packages (including unity, unity-2d, unity-common) even if these packages appear in the list of installed packages in the first system.\nEven if these commands are inputted in sequence on the same computer, they work fine in a 32 bit environment but seems to fail in a 64 bit environment.

I tried a bunch of different codes but am still not able to add a back button or add a google search bar.\n\nA: If this is the tutorial by Jono Bacon on Youtube, launch glade with quickly design and add a button to the toolbar similar to the refresh button that Jono adds ~12:30. Call it backbutton and create a handler for it when clicked and then sketch a function that will pull the previous URL that was passed (just create a list and append successful URLs to it, then pop it when needed). If you want to preprocess a URL entered in the entrybox, add code in the handler to do it. Here's some sample code:\n#Code for other initializing.... \n....whatever goes here...\nself.history=[]\n\ndef on_urlentry_activate(self,widget):\n    #store previous location in history\n    self.history.append(self.webview.get_uri())\n\n    url = widget.get_text()\n\n    #add http:// if not present in the url\n    if 'http://' not in url:\n        url='http://'+url\n\n    self.webview.open(url)\n\n\ndef on_backbutton_activate(self,widget):\n    #Only get the last url if there's something to get\n    if len(self.history)!=0:\n        #Use pop to remove the last entry from the list\n        url=self.history.pop()\n        self.webview.open(url)\n\nThis code is not very sophisticated, but should give you the idea.\nAs Timo has pointed out, WebKitGTK has a number of great functions and features including a go_back() method (If you read the manual).

I am planing to buy a Lenovo G580 (59-324061) laptop. I found it is the best laptop in that price range. However, if I Google it for support in Ubuntu, I see many people complaining about driver problems with Ubuntu 12.04. I've read about wired network problems and brightness control issues with Ubuntu 12.04.\nIs it really that bad?\n\nA: The driver problem for the Atheros AR8162 network card in the Lenovo G580 was solved in the latest Ubuntu 12.04 point release (12.04.2, 14 Feb 2013). The LTS Enablement Stack introduced in that release will pull in Linux kernel 3.5.0 from Quantal, which has built-in support for the alx driver.\nFor those currently on 12.04: updating to 12.04.2 will not automatically enable the LTS Enablement Stack. You must install the package linux-generic-lts-quantal to do that.\n\nA: I have been the same problem. This pc works very good...

(Here's the link).  I got rid of the log and go it working, but every couple weeks, I'd have the EXACT SAME ISSUE.  Kind of annoying, but I delete the log, restart machine and I'm running again.  I finally figured out how to send that log (which contained NOTHING else) to /dev/null.  Worked great.  Today, I had the SAME PROBLEM AGAIN!  Only instead of the xsession-errors file, the logfile in question was in my .vnc directory.\nAgain, it's logging the same line \"AM Authentication deferred - ignoring client message\" several thousand times per second until the log fills up.  I can't find anything online regarding this error.  Any ideas what the root cause of this might be?\nThanks for any ideas!\n\nA: That might be an DOS attack of your VNC service, you could change the default port 5901 to something else, this will probably minimize the problem if it's a DOS attack.\nAnother go at the issue, if it's still DOS related, is to let VNC server listening on local network interface and use SSH tunneling which also would give you increased security for remote access to your desktop.\nSetup tunnel from your client to server using ssh command:\nssh user@at.your.server -L 5901:localhost:5901\nand then connect to localhost:5901 using vncviewer on the client.\n\nA: I just wrote a post in the forums of what I found to be the root cause of this issue. In my logs it appeared as if what caused the log file to grow so large was a brute-force attack not a DOS attack. Although I did find that the brute force attack seemed to be distributed (a characteristic more common to DOS type attacks).\nThe log filling up is a result of the failed attempts to authenticate to your system's VNC server. After a certain number of failed attempts it appears as if the VNC server just starts rejecting the attempted connections without giving them a chance to authenticate (which is good). Luckily, if these are still happening then most likely they haven't hacked you yet.

You can also stop individual folders from being synced and re-synced again by simply activate/deactivate the corresponding checkbox in the same window.\nBoth options allow you to run a first time/one time sync and stop syncing, so you can delete what you don't wish to be in sync and it will remain on the cloud but if you reactivate the global/partial sync, the files will come to your computer.\nHere is a screenshot (This system is in spanish, just for your consideration)\n\nGood luck!\n\nA: The solution I can think of is to upload your photos and then uninstall Ubuntu One from your PC.\nThis way, your PC won't be syncing, but your photos will remain \"in the cloud\".\n", "Q: \"grub rescue>\" Can't get past this message in spite of EVERYTHING! There must be a way? Everybody will understand this problem I think, but somebody will have the solution (I can't find it on here even after searching). It's a straightforward (!) boot up issue (I wish!!!!).\nI have a laptop with several partitions. One of them is Ubuntu 12.04.1, another is Oracle VM, another is Windows XP etc. I made an adjustment via a partition manager within XP and upon the re-boot I've got the dreaded \"grub rescue>\" prompt.... I cannot boot from CD or USB versions of any of these; Windows XP, Ubuntu 12.04.1 Live, Rescatux, Super Grub2 Disk, or even Boot Disk, which means I'm very unsure of how to repair / re-config the grub record or even fix the Windows MBR and then sort out things from there.\nThanks to other posts, I can find the folder with several dozen *.mod files. So I'm pretty sure I'm in the right partition now (even if it's slightly corrupt or now in the wrong order etc). From \"grub rescue>\" I typed  \"ls (hd0,msdos5)/boot/grub\" to find this area and  this is after the \"error: unknown filesystem\" response to the other options (Hd0) (hd0,msdos6) etc.\nI have to other MAC OSX machines which I normally use, but I can't think how to solve this at all (very limited knowledge of Ubuntu to date).  If anybody sees this and thinks they have a possible solution, I'd be really appreciative of the commands or procedure to recover.

The irony is, I understand exactly what you are saying and agree 100% but.... Within the BIOS, you can alter the order that things boot in and I'd already made sure that the HD was LAST, i.e. after everything else in boot order.

I don't want to use windows or any other dual boot os. And i need only 3 partitions on my hard disk. One for the OS and remaining two for data storage. I don't want to create swap also.\nNow can i create all primary partitions on the hard disk. Are there any disadvantages in doing so. If all the partitions are primary i think i can easily resize partitions in future. \nOn second thought i have the idea of using seperate partition for /home. Is it good practice . If i have to do this, i will create 4 partitions all primary. In any case i don't want to create more than 4 partitions . And i know the limit will be 4. \nSo is it safe to create all 3 or 4 primary partitions. Pls suggest me, What are the good practices . \n(previously i used win-xp and win-7 on dual boot with 2 primary partitions and that bugged me somehow i don't remember. Since then i felt there should be only one primary partition in a hard disk.)\nEDIT 1 :\nNow i will use four partitions in the sequence - / , /home , /for-data , /swap . I have another question. Does a partition need continuous blocks on the disk. I mean if i want to resize partitions later, can i add space from sda3 to sda1. Is it possible and is it safe to do ? \nEDIT 2 : \nI have created 4partitions - ( / , /data1 , /data2 , /swap ). The first three partitions are of type ext4. Now the /data1 and /data2 partitions have root account as owner. I must have root permissions for copying normal files to those partitions which might be little inconvenient. What should i do ?? Shall i just take the ownership of these partitions and chmod them to 644. Will this work?  \"chown user:user /media/data1\" and then \"chmod 644 /media/data1/*\". \n\nA: In principle there is no problem with all 4 primary partitions. Some of the new computers are shipping with 4 primary partitions. The main concern is, you will have no option to make any more partitions, in case you need one more.\nEven though computers these days have enough RAM to run Ubuntu, the operating system has roots in older time when a swap partition was a must. So even though you may not need it, it is a good idea to have one. It will make the system feel happy.\nA separate /home partition is actually an excellent idea. I put it in all my Ubuntu installs. This makes fresh installs of new versions dead simple. Sometimes upgrades from the previous versions don't go well. At other times, after four or five upgrades on top of one another, the system gets cluttered with stuff you don't need and a fresh install is the solution. In these situations a separate /home partition makes it easy to retain your personal data and settings while starting afresh with a new system install.\nSo if you go with /, /home, and swap you still have space for one more primary partition for data. \nThe partitions need not be in continuous blocks. You can leave unallocated spaces in between. For example, if you leave some unallocated space in between sda3 and sda4. You may later expand sda3 or move sda4 to the left and then expand sda4. \nHowever, when the partitions get very full, there may not be enough space to copy files over for moving partitions. Then you won't be able to move them around. So, it may be better to adjust your partitions sooner than later.\nEven though I don't remember the last time I had my data erased or corrupted by fiddling with partitions, it can happen. Sometimes it is operator error, that is, I make the wrong choice. Thus, it is very very important to backup everything in another hard drive before embarking on any kind of partition re sizing, moving, and deleting.\nHope this helps\n\nA: Nope, not ok. Not in your case. Not in about any case, in fact.\nThere's a question that comes before this... Why creating more than 1 partition? I make it simple for you: there's no reason. 1 partition is enough for your case. And you should always hope for the least amount of partitions, keep things simple.\nDisk Partitioning is an outdated solution to solve issues that don't exist any more.\nAlleged benefits people come up with: separating OS from user files (I address this below, in \"cloning OS installation\"), swap partition (all OS'es use swap files now), cache and log files (no OS will flood itself with logs now), easier save from corrupted partition (never seem it happening, and all new partition schemes are basically corruption-free), and the list goes on.\nThere's really only 2 reasons to create partitions nowadays (user wise), and only 1 of them I consider good. There can be more reasons for very specific situations, none of which pointed to a desktop.\n\n*\n\n*Different OS's need different schemes.\nYou know, Windows goes with NTFS, ubuntu ext4, mac is hfs+, and so on. There's no way around this other than having lots of memory for virtualization - which is actually much better, user wise.\n\n\n*Cloning OS installation.\nI can see reasoning for doing this, but I don't buy them. If you're installing a new OS you are better off with a clean install. If you have to replicate a custom OS, you're better off doing the first one and cloning that, in a single partition. The supposed separated files should have their own backup always, anyway, non-related to partition schemes, and all OS's offer solutions for this already. Backing up is way more important than worrying about partitions and all maintenance issues they raise.\n", "Q: Cannot shutdown, computer freezes I've installed Ubuntu 12.04 (near windows 7) on my laptop(Dell studio xps 1640 with Ati Radeon HD 3670) and everything is working fine, but when I want to shutdown my computer it freezes!\nI don't know what to do after that, then I have to use power button to power off the computer and it's not good at all.

Then, I run:\nmount -o remount,rw /\n\nand it Worked for that Terminal Session!\nWhen I go back to recovery, I select to resume Boot Normally but I get the Same Error!\na\nI also tried to Boot to my Root Shell again, remount as Read-Write and Start Gnome from there. It Worked! (But the user is ROOT, and is quite Dangerous!)\nHowever, I can't do all this proccess at every boot!\nAny Solution?\n(Note that when I try to create a new File in my Ubuntu Partition from another OS, I don't get any Errors!)\n\nA: check your S.M.A.R.T.\nlooks like your HDD is failing\n\nA: Try this: instead of using the Root shell to mount the filesystem in read-write mode, choose \"Resume Normal Boot.\" This will mount your filesystem in read-write mode (it even warns you that it's about to do that,) and then it will boot normally.\n"]
