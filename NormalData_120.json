["Q: Moving 11.10 complete system to a new bigger Harddisk I would like to move my current installation of Ubuntu 11.10 to a bigger harddisk, since the old one is failing.\nI would like to avoid solutions like dd block copying (since there would be unused space at the end) with something cleaner, but I'm open to suggestions.\nPartitions info:\nSize  Used Avail Use% Mounted on Partition type Encrypted\n19G  9.9G  7.6G  57% /           ext4\n59G   50G  6.2G  90% /home       ext4           Yes\n\nWhat is the best way to accomplish such a task, preferably with advantages/disadvantages of any given approach.\n\nA: Use clonezilla.\nIt will allow you to clone your current system including the mbr without actually copying unused space that dd does hence doing it faster\nSince its reading / writing on a filesystem level you can only use it on a supported filesystem, on the contrary to dd, which works on a device level, allowing the copy of any filesystem.\nClonezilla's front page has a list of the software's limitations:\n\n  \n*\n  \n*The destination partition must be equal or larger than the source one.\n  \n*Differential/incremental backup is not implemented yet.\n  \n*Online imaging/cloning is not implemented yet. The partition to be imaged or cloned has to be unmounted.\n  \n*Software RAID/fake RAID/firmware RAID is not supported by default. It can be done manually only.\n  \n*Due to the image format limitation, the image cannot be explored or mounted. You can not recovery single file from the image. However, you\n  still have workaround to make it, read this.\n  \n*Recovery Clonezilla live with multiple CDs or DVDs is not implemented yet. Now all the files have to be in one CD or DVD if you\n  choose to create the recovery iso file.\n  \n\n\nA: I'd use Gparted.\n\n\n*\n\n*start from your Gparted LiveCD or LiveUSB (using Lily)\n\n*Plug in both of your HD (old and new one)\n\n*select partitions on the old disk and \"COPY\" it on the new disk\n\n*Resize partitions on your new disk according to your willing\n\n*Start from Ubuntu liveCD/liveUSB\n\n*Use  blkid to check the UUID of the partitions on the new disk\n\n*Edit your /etc/fstab located on your new disk according to your UUID \n\n*Open a terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T) in order to re-install Grub on your new disk. \nfdisk -l\n\nfdisk to Check the name of the Ubuntu partition on your new disk.

In short, you have to boot to Ubuntu live CD, then\n  using gparted prepare your new HDD by creating the partition of the\n  same size of old system partition and leaving extra free space before\n  creating any new partitions. Then backup partition using partimage,\n  restore it to system partition on new HDD, fix grub, and then resize\n  the new system partition to desired value.\nHere is the explanation in details. Connect both hard drives and boot\n  from Ubuntu Live CD. Then you need to enable universe/multiverse\n  repositories. When this is done open terminal (Alt+F2 then type\n  gnome-terminal) and type:\nsudo apt-get install gparted partimage\n\nand when this is done type:\nsudo gparted   \n\n1\n\nFor Complete detailed instructions, see Ubuntu How To's\n1Source:Ubuntu How To's\n\nA: You can also use redobackup, it makes a whole disk image, and will exactly image your current computer to the larger hard disk. \nAfter you were done, you would want to expand your partition to fill the rest of the disk with gparted.\nRedobackup is pretty intuitive. \n", "Q: Problem with Python3 picking Python2 package I installed python3-numpy package, but trying to import it in Python3 interpreter I get this:\n$ python3\nPython 3.2.3 (default, May  3 2012, 15:54:42) \n[GCC 4.6.3] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> import numpy\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"/home/zetah/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/__init__.py\", line 128, in <module>\n    from version import git_revision as __git_revision__\nImportError: No module named version\n>>> \n\nLooking in Synaptic I see python3-numpy is installed in /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/numpy/\nWhy is it picking wrong package and what can I do to remedy this?\n\nA: In my ~/.profile file, probably following some online suggestion, I had this line:\nexport PYTHONPATH=$HOME/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH\nso PYTHONPATH env was pointing to folder where I build local Python packages (from source)\nRemoving above line from ~/.profile (which BTW could have been declared in ~/.bashrc also) resolves this issue and works perfectly.

If you don't have a trash.desktop file, you can create one.  Open gedit, and include the following:\n[Desktop Entry]\nType=Application\nIcon=user-trash\nName=Trash\nGenericName=Trash\nComment=open trash in PCManFM\nCategories=FileManager;Utility;Core;GTK;\nExec=pcmanfm trash:///\nStartupNotify=true\nTerminal=false\nMimeType=x-directory/normal;inode/directory;\n\nChange the line Icon=user-trash with the location of your image.

However, when I logged in I no longer had a network connection.\nI am running an AMD-based PC with a D-LINK DFE-530TXS network card and as I said, it worked fine in 11.10.\nI have scoured the Internet and come across a thousand slightly varying solutions, but they are too convoluted for someone new to Linux.  Not because I can't follow the steps, but because most of the tools/utilities that are referenced (e.g. to compile, install, etc.) are not available when I use the stated steps in the solutions.\nSo....should I re-install 11.10 or is there hope in getting this version to use the NIC that I know works.\nI have  the latest driver from d-link for my NIC but I have no idea how to 'install' it for Ubuntu 12.04 to use.\nI know you will require additional information, but I wasn't sure what you would need.\nThanks in advance.\n\nThanks for the tip. To answer your question, the d-link DFE-530TXS is a 10/100 Ethernet NIC.\nSlight edit to this response to your tip.  Now when I view the network configuration tool, I see what I saw from immediately after the upgrade to 12.04.  For my Wired Connection 1, it has the comment \"Cable Unplugged\".  As so many other people on here have commented, the cable is very much PLUGGED in.  The same cable was tested on another computer and it works just fine so I know the switch is o.k. as well.\nIs there a way to just wipe the slate clean by removing any and all network related settings, devices, etc. and having it all re-detected?\nThanks\n\nA: you should open the network-configurator and check, if there is a connection configured. if not you should choose the wlan tab or the network tab (dunno if your card is wlan or ethernet) and configure network. its an easy and self explaining job\n2nd Try:\nmaybe your ethernet-car is defect. do you have another one to test? otherwise i would buy a new one. they are usually very cheap hardware.\n", "Q: How to use `chown` and `chmod` to make a \"pipe\" or \"pass through\" link from guest directory to elsewhere I want to either extend the size of my guest partition or figure out how to copy stuff from the guest partition to my normal /home directory.\n(Because of some other problems I can only run Xorg as guest, but I can log into virtual console as myself or root.)\nHere's the motivation: I want to torrent a large file. It's larger than my guest filesystem. But I have plenty of space  on my real drive, I just can't log into it graphically.\nSo I tried to set up a \"pipe\" to get the file out of the tmpfs. I did:\nsu -u myself \n#catch\nmkdir ~/receiver_dir\n\nsudo su\ncd /tmp/guest-lkj567UIO/ \n#throw\nln -s mario_pipe /home/myself/receiver_dir\nchown -R guest-lkj567UIO /home/myself/receiver_dir\nchown -R guest-lkj567UIO /tmp/guest-lkj567UIO/mario_pipe\nchmod -R a+rw /home/myself/receiver_dir\nchmod -R a+rw /tmp/guest-lkj567UIO/mario_pipe\n\nsu -u guest-lkj567UIO\ncd /tmp/guest-lkj567UIO\ncd mario_pipe\ntouch something #success!\n\nHowever, when I try to torrent to /tmp/guest-lkj567UIO/mario_pipe, Transmission says I don't have write permissions. But it looks like I just wrote there? And that everybody (a+rw) can write there in fact?\nMaybe this indicates I don't actually understand chown and chmod but nothing from their man pages pops out.\n\nA: When you log in as guest, there is an apparmor profile that is loaded to restrict access to lock down the guest account so that it can't write outside of its home directory, even if the file's permissions give access.\nYou might be able to get around this by using a bind mount instead of a symlink:\nmkdir /tmp/guest-lkj567UIO/mario_pipe\nmount --bind /home/myself/receiver_dir /tmp/guest-lkj567UIO/mario_pipe\n\n", "Q: Impossible quandrary involving UCK, graphics card, and Nvidia drivers I have a computer that I want to install Ubuntu on.  It is an older gaming computer with a Nvidia graphics card.  When I attempt to boot any unmodified Linux distribution onto it, I get a \"Boot error\" message, which I assume is because the computer uses a discrete graphics card, which the Linux kernel does not have support for.  Ordinarily, that would not be a problem, as I would just plug the monitor into the VGA port built in to the motherboard.\nHowever, this particular model of motherboard does not have an on-board graphics connector, so I am stuck with using the graphics card connection.  That further would not be a problem; all I would have to do would be to use UCK to create a customized Ubuntu image that included the graphics drivers.\nExcept for the fact that the Nvidia Linux drivers must be installed on a computer with a Nvidia graphics card present.  So while using UCK, the driver installer fails with a message stating that there is no Nvidia graphics card present.\nHow do I get Ubuntu on my desktop computer?\nEdit: I have a computer with a dual core (quad with Hyper-Threading) Intel Pentium Extreme Edition, an Intel D975XBX motherboard, 4 GB of DDR2 memory, and a  Nvidia GeForce GTS 450.\n\nA: You have two options, to install Ubuntu on a machine on which the live CD's GUI doesn't work:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use the alternate install CD (text-based installer). This is non-graphical, and should work to install Ubuntu even in the rare event that Ubuntu cannot get any GUI working at all.\nOnce you've installed the system, you can install any necessary drivers. (Though on any system, at least a non-3D-accelerated GUI should be possible, so you might just install all available updates first and see if that fixes it.) To install the proprietary NVidia driver for newer cards without a GUI, see below.\n\n*You can install NVidia drivers without an NVidia card present. If you wish to master your own live CD with these drivers included, you can run the commands while chrooted into the live CD system. (These are also useful for installing the drivers on a system you've created by installing with the alternate CD, if you boot into that system and find that the GUI does not work.)\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-current\n\nThis information should be sufficient to enable you to get Ubuntu working on that machine. But more specific advice may be possible if you tell us specifically what Nvidia card you're using (make and model), as well as the make and model of the machine if applicable and otherwise the make and model of the motherboard, and also if you have any preferences as to how you want to install the driver or what driver version you want to install.\nFor example, if you want to manually download the Nvidia driver from the Nvidia website, rather than automatically from Ubuntu's official repositories, please let us know that (and also explain why you want to do it this way, in case there are other alternatives that can be recommended for your specific needs).\n", "Q: Quickly ubuntu-application + indicator template don't work I've started to work with quickly and python (because I wanted to have some GTk3 integration and create and appindicator), and so I create the projecto like this :\nquickly create ubuntu-application ualarm\ncd ualarm\nquickly run\n\nAnd the application launched.

To change a global setting you run \nsudo -u lightdm dbus-launch gsettings set com.canonical.unity-greeter <setting-name> <setting>\n\nFor string settings, I think you need quotes around the setting value.\nFor example:\nsudo -u lightdm dbus-launch gsettings set com.canonical.unity-greeter background '/usr/share/backgrounds/Twilight_Frost_by_Phil_Jackson.jpg'\n\nI use dconf-editor to browse through these settings, it's available in the dconf-tools package.\nNow, what Mitch is saying does work, but it seems it might require you to change the wallpaper twice for the greeter to pick up the change.

Also, the =1 worked rather than the =0 so it should read as:\n\"quiet splash i915.modeset=1\"\n\n\nA: With xubuntu 14.04, I found that setting vga=792 as above worked for me, however I also noted a message that reported that the vga=792 parameter is deprecated. I subsequently found a more modern solution which I cribbed from the /etc/default/grub file of a manjaro live cd. I added the following two lines to /etc/default/grub:\nGRUB_GFXMODE=1024x768\n\nGRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=keep\n\n(Don't forget to run sudo update-grub)\nThis worked fine.

I really don't want Shotwell to move my files around.\n\nA: You have to do two things to achieve your four goals.  \nFirst, don't use Shotwell to import new photos. Import them with Nautilus to wherever you want to keep the pictures.  \nSecond, change a setting in Shotwell. Edit/Preferences/Library(tab)/Import photos to: and select 'Other', then navigate to where you store your photos. This should be a drive that mounts automatically whenever you login. Check the box 'Watch library directory for new files'. That will automatically detect changes as you add or subtract images using Nautilus. The 'Importing' settings are irrelevant. You will not be using Shotwell to import images, so no need to change them.  \n\n", "Q: Wubi 12.04 installation error executing command command I have tried to install wubi but have not had luck because there is an error executing command: \n\n\n>>command=C:\\Users\\Me\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\pyl4266.tmp\\bin\\resize2fs.exe-f C:\\ubuntu\\disks\\root.disk 17744M\n>>retval=1\n>>stderr=\n>>stdout=resize2fs1.40.6 (09-Feb-2008)\nUsage:\n/cygdrive/c/Users/Eriks/AppData/Local/Temp/pyl4266.tmp/bin/resize2fs.exe-f C:/ubuntu/disks.root.disk17744M [-d debug_flags][-f][-F][-p] device[new_size]\n\nI do not understand what is the problem.

Can I manually allocate space for my home folder? I'm using Ubuntu 12.04, but there are some programs like AutoCAD, SolidWorks and Comsol Multyphysics that can run only on a Windows system.  \nI decided to reinstall my laptop, so I will install first Windows XP and then Ubuntu 12.04 again.\n\n\n*\n\n*While installing Windows - do I have to make 2 partitions (one for XP and another for Ubuntu) or at the next step, when I'm going to install Ubuntu, I can do it?\n\n*If I'm installing Ubuntu with Wubi, can I decide how much space will be my home folder, or it's doing everything automatically?\n\n\nA: You can create 2 partitions when you install Windows XP if you want, but it is also possible to do it as you install Ubuntu afterwards, also the Ubuntu installer is more graphical therefore I think it is much easier to use so I would recommend doing as you install Ubuntu.\nYou can select how much space is used by the whole of Ubuntu when you install with wubi, although you cannot decide how much space is used specifically by the home folder (but I believe you wanted to decide how much space the whole of Ubuntu uses anyway). \nI would recommend installing Ubuntu via a live CD/DVD/USB rather than using wubi if your are comfortable doing so as wubi is known to (although rarely) cause problems.\nHope this helps.\nP.S. This answer may be worded badly with mistakes as I have just woken up so an edit would be much appreciated! :) \n\nA: *\n\n*No, Ubuntu is installed in a file inside the Windows partition. One of the reasons for this is that it minimizes the risk that the Windows system will be damaged in any way by installing or using the Wubi system.\n\n*Yes, you can decide how much HD you want for Ubuntu... but there's a limit which forces you to make the Ubuntu \"partiton\" a bit small to be the OS used by default. Wubi should be used in my opinion as a fast, writeable Live CD, not as a real installation.\n\n\nAlso, remember that Wubi is not going to work anymore by default running in Ubuntu CDs, as Microsoft will force to the other PC companies to include UEFI, which is uncompatible.\nIn conclusion: use Wubi just for testing, not for real use. If you like Ubuntu after testing with Wubi, install it in your HD or in an USB drive.\n\nA: This site really works best one question at a time. But in this case, they're really very related so I guess it's ok. \nWhile installing Windows, you don't have to make any room for Ubuntu at all – regardless of whether you're installing normally or using Wubi. Later, when you install Ubuntu, you'll have the option to decide how much goes to Ubuntu. In the case of a normal install, it'll automatically resize the Windows partition for you. You just use a slider to decide how much goes to Windows and how much goes to Ubuntu. In the case of Wubi, you select the size of the disk image.\nAt least by default, the Ubuntu installer uses a single file system for your Ubuntu system, including your home, so you don't have to choose that. \nI wouldn't personally recommend using Wubi. The simple truth is that it's used by so few people, testing is quite poor and consequently, there are numerous issues with it. If, for some reason, you can't use the normal installer, it's fine, but if you can use the normal installer and install from a USB stick or CD/DVD, that's always preferable. The installation process is just as simple. \nThe big difference between a wubi install and a normal install, is that the wubi install doesn't use a partition on your harddisk, but instead stores everything in a disk image located on your Windows filesystem. This often causes some issues. For instance, in the case of a power outage, your disk image might get \"lost\", causing you to be unable to boot Ubuntu and you'll have to manually recover the file – this isn't straight forward. \nSo all in all, I'd recommend that you install Ubuntu using the normal installer and not Wubi. And if it's ok to wipe the entire disk while installing Windows, just tell the installer to use all available space. Later, when you install Ubuntu, you tell it how much space you want. Or you can just leave empty – unpartitioned – space while installing Windows and tell the Ubuntu installer to use free space. Either approach is fine, though the former is slightly faster. \n\nA: If you want to install windows on your system and dual boot with your current ubuntu installation, you don't have to re-install the ubuntu all-over again. You can chroot into your ubuntu installation after installing Windows on separate partition and booting from Ubuntu installation disk. There you just have to re-install the grub-loader to get your ubuntu back.\nFind the detailed instructions at : \nhttp://meandmyubuntulinux.blogspot.com/2012/06/installing-windows-after-ubuntu-while.html\nHope this helps ....\n", "Q: Please provide me the way to download \"Youtube Video Downloader\" \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow to download flash (streaming) videos from sites like youtube, dailymotion, vimeo, etc.? \n\nPlease tell me the way to download youtube video downloader.....\nOS: Ubuntu 12.04\n\nA: You can use Minitube YouTube downloader.

I need to know if there is any possible way that i can download and install driver for my wifi.\n2. what other option do i have to be able to update ubuntu.\nThanks\nKB\n\nA: Ubuntu Server has no GUI by default.\nYour two other questions are:\n\n*\n\n*Can I download and install the driver for my wifi network card?\n\n*Is there another way (outside of wifi )to update Ubuntu?\n\nI also recently installed the server version of 12.04. I think the answer to these two questions are:\n\n*\n\n*You need to tell us what wifi network card your Toshiba has. The most important thing is the chipset. But the problem here is that even if there was a wifi card driver that you could download, you're using wifi. So the answer would be no. I suggest trying a wired ethernet connection.\n\n*The answer is yes. Use wireless ethernet. Honestly, @Mahesh's suggestion is the best for you. You can always install those server components later.\n\n", "Q: Would the use of nepomuk be allowed in the app developer contest? Ive recently switched to the platform and don't remember if installed it or it came with the system. Would Nepomuk be considered part of the allowed packages?\n\nA: As long as the necessary packages are available in the standard Ubuntu archives you can use them.  There appear to be many nepomuk related packages there, so as long as you only need those your application would qualify.\n", "Q: How to Tab-complete directories when in symlinked directory? I have a symlink:\n/path/to/foo -> /path/to/bar/foo\n\nWhen in /path/to/foo I might want to cd to /path/to/bar/foo:\n$ cd ../ Tab\nThen nothing autocompletes. I can still cd just fine by typing in the directory \"bar\", though.\nWhy is that? Is there a setting or trick I can apply to have that tab-complete too?\n\nA: This is a bug in bash-completion (a third-party project, not affiliated with bash itself). /etc/bash_completion is sourced in ~/.bashrc by default in Ubuntu, and amongst the thousands of lines of code (most of which you likely never need), is a completion function for the cd builtin that doesn't handle symlinked directories properly. If you disable its completion for the cd builtin, your tab-completion for cd should work more like you expect.\ncomplete -r cd\n\n\nA: I think this is by design and how Bash handles the present working directory.\nCompare the outputs of:\n\n\n*\n\n*pwd\n\n*pwd -P\n(The latter displays the physical current working directory instead of the symlinked one. Pwd manual.)\nYou can make Bash to always use the physical working directory by using:\nset -P\n\nThe manual states:\n\n-P      If  set,  the  shell does not follow symbolic links when executing commands such as cd that  change  the  current working \n  directory. It  uses  the  physical  directory structure instead. By\n  default, bash follows the logical chain  of  directories  when \n  performing  commands which change the current directory.\n\nAs a side effect, when you cd /path/to/foo, your pwd will be: /path/to/bar/foo.\n", "Q: kvm in ubuntu desktop It's possible install kvm in ubuntu desktop version, or it only could be installed in server version.\nForums always explain over server version, I'm wandering if desktop version could do the same.\nThanks in advance. \n\nA: Yes it can be installed on the desktop no bother. \nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Installation\nUbuntu's documentation is very good and will guide you through installing it and setting it up. If you are working on a Ubuntu with a desktop environment then install this package to manage your virtual machines. \nsudo apt-get install virt-manager\n\nBill\n", "Q: set installer background / not able to run early_command in custom preseed file I have a custom preseed file for a Precise Live CD  (which is well loaded on boot, I checked syslog for that).\nMy initial problem is that when booting in install mode (default behavior for a Live CD), ubiquity runs X with a default wallpaper which is hardcoded to /usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png in Ubiquity code.\nSo my idea was to run early_command (https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/installation-guide/i386/preseed-advanced.html) to copy my custom wallpaper over /usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png.\nAssuming my custom wallpaper allready resides on the rootfs in /usr/share/backgrounds.\nBut...

You can specify the settings for a window.\nhttp://openbox.org/wiki/Help:Applications\n\nA: You may be able to use the DISPLAY environment variable to do this (see output of printenv DISPLAY) - something like\nenv DISPLAY=:0 application-name\nand then adjust for other applications...\n", "Q: Can something be installed in /usr by my app showdown project? I am working on a project for Ubuntu App Showdown Contest (https://launchpad.net/wuuzy) and I wanted to know if it is possible to install things like libraries in /usr. My project, in fact, use an extension system to improve itself with more options. It is like a plugin system and it generates libs which are currently installed in /usr. Also my app generates a gir file installed in /usr/lib/girepository-1.0/ and in /usr/local/share/gir-1.0/. It uses also a gsettings schema which is installed /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/. Naturally I install also the .desktop file in /usr/share/applications even if I have a copy of it in /opt/PROJECT.\nSo what I really want to know is if this installations targets are allowed for an app which want to join to the Ubuntu App Showdown Contest.\n\nA: The rules for the contest is that your application must entirely run in /opt. While in future contests we hope to be able to relax this requirement (as we sandbox Ubuntu better in the future), right now we need to require that your app runs fully in /opt.\n", "Q: Trying to create a GtkTreeView from Python, doesn't seem to work I'm writing an app using Gtk/PyGI, and I need to create a sidebar with a Nautilus-like tree.\nHowever, Gtk refuses to cooperate with me. I tried both with Glade and GtkBuilder (creating the GtkTreeStore with one gchararray column) and with this code:\ndef create_widgets(self):\n  self.hbox = Gtk.Box(orientation = Gtk.Orientation.HORIZONTAL)\n  self.add(self.hbox)\n  self.treestore = Gtk.TreeStore(str)\n  self.treeview = Gtk.TreeView(self.treestore)\n  self.treestore.append([\"Item 1\"])\n  self.treestore.append([\"Item 2\"])\n  self.hbox.pack_start(self.treeview, True, True, 0)\n\nBoth versions raise a TypeError: Expected Gtk.TreeIter, but got StructMeta starting at the first self.treestore.append() in my code and trickling down through the library's files.\nI thought it's because GtkTreeStore's .append also takes a GtkTreeIter, but if I pass something like \"0\" as the first argument nothing changes, if I pass something like self.treestore.get_iter(\"0\") it errors out saying it's an invalid tree path, and if I pass None it works, but shows an empty window.\nI tried replacing the GtkTreeStore with a GtkListStore. The result doesn't error out - instead, it shows the very same empty window as before.\nSo, what am I doing wrong? I went through the docs time and time again, but I still can't figure it out.\n\nA: A Gtk.TreeStore and Gtk.ListStore are different in that a Gtk.ListStore is a flat list where you append rows as a list, whereas a Gtk.TreeStore holds parent/child data, so it takes the parent as Gtk.TreeIter and a list as row.\nparent_iter = treestore.append(None, [\"parent row\"])\ntreestore.append(parent_iter, [\"child row\"])\n\nhttp://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.org/en/latest/treeview.html#Gtk.TreeStore.append\nAs for the empty window, have a look at the views section of the docs.\n\nA: I came across this demo which uses a TreeStore: http://git.gnome.org/browse/pygobject/tree/demos/gtk-demo/gtk-demo.py\n", "Q: Configuring the dnsmasq instance started by connection sharing in NetworkManager I've got a laptop running Ubuntu 12.04 that is sharing its wifi connection to another machine through the eth0 interface using NetworkManager. This seems to be done by dnsmasq.\nNow I need to set up PXE/TFTP booting on the other machine, so I'd like to configure the dnsmasq instance that is spawned through NetworkManager to add a couple of lines for PXE/TFTP. How is this done? It seems to ignore /etc/dnsmasq.conf.\nPrevious answers seem to indicate that the configuration is hardcoded into NetworkManager. Is this still the case? If so, is there an easy way to achieve what I'm trying to do here? I suppose I could just disable the network sharing in NetworkManager and set it up manually, but I'd rather keep this all managed in one place if it all possible.\nedit: Indeed, it seems the dnsmasq configuration is still hardcoded in NetworkManager. See source here. It seems to me that it would be a much better solution to simply specify an alternate dnsmasq.conf file here, but I'm sure there are issues I haven't considered.\n\nA: Dnsmasq doesn't \"share connections\". The role of the NetworkManager-controlled dnsmasq is to route DNS traffic.\nYou can't configure the NetworkManager-controlled dnsmasq process in Precise. In Quantal you are able to configure it via files in /etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/. See dnsmasq(8).\nAnother possibility is to use the standalone dnsmasq server which is fully configurable even in Precise. To run standalone dnsmasq alongside NM-dnsmasq in Precise you need to give standalone dnsmasq the \"except-interface=lo\" option. This is not necessary in Quantal.\n", "Q: I have installed ubuntu alongside windows vista but Ubuntu won't run I installed ubuntu on my pc alongside windows Vista\nWhen I choose to boot ubuntu the PC doesn't run.

Remark: the \"Recommended repair\" button will repair/reinstall GRUB, which I think is not necessary in your case because you can see the GRUB menu.\n\n*From the GRUB menu, select the \"Previous Linux versions\" entry (if it exists), and check if you have the same error with the old kernels.\n\n", "Q: How do I deploy a virtualized server on a headless machine running 12.04 Server? There is so much different information out there about setting up a virtual machine but I'm at a lost where to start. My fundamental question is:\nHow do I virtually deploy a web server (complete with a unique set of users) on top of the headless machine that I'm running?\nThe things that make my particular system unique (i.e. makes it hard for me to find information via google):\n\n\n*\n\n*Server is wireless.\n\n*Server doesn't run a GUI.\n\n\nMost tutorials/howtos assume a wired connection and/or a GUI.\nWhat I've Tried\n\n\n*\n\n*I've read documentation for libvirt, qemu, and kvm. I've also seen a number of tutorials that use ubuntu-vm-builder or qemu-img. I'm just not sure where to start. I'm not sure how to think about the entire stack: I think it looks like this: libvirt --controls--> qemu --controls--> kvm. But I'm not sure.\n\n*I've turned on virtualization through the BIOS on my system. \n\n*I've installed the qemu* and libvirt* packages.\n\n*I've tried to run qemu-system-x86_64 ubuntu-server-12.04.iso with the downloaded server ISO. This didn't work.\n\n\nChallenges I haven't found the answers to yet.\n\n\n*\n\n*What are the canonical steps to get a virtualized server running? Do you start with qemu-img? Or does the first step begin with ubuntu-vm-builder?\n\n*How do you keep it running every time your physical server boots?\n\n*One tutorial noted that you couldn't bridge off of a wireless card. Is this still true today?\n\n*I don't understand how to edit /etc/network/interfaces. I use wlan0 as my primary networking interface so I'm a little tentative to mess with it since all the tutorials I've seen assume that I'm using eth0.\n\n*All of the tutorials I've seen assume that I have a GUI running. I don't. How would I get the guest OS to blit to the video card (I have a video card, but Ubuntu Server just runs CLI)?\n\n*There are a lot of filesystems available for using qemu-img. Which should I use?\n\n\nThere are a lot of questions stuffed into this one. Sorry, but the question I care about most is at the beginning. My preference is to not to have to install Xen or use Virtual Box.\n\nA: I'm going to keep a running log of the progress that I've made so far. I'll clean this up later and post it as an answer if I succeed.\nDay 1\n\n*\n\n*I'm mainly using this tutorial. Note that it was originally for 9.10 /and/ it assumes that the primary network interface is eth0. I'm using a wireless card as my primary interface. As a sidenote, I'm not sure that using libvirt is the best way to go. We'll see.\n\n*It's true that bridging off a wireless card isn't supported out of the box. Here is a howto on how to get around that (note that this howto builds off another one). I've tried it but because I'm still trying to use libvirt to manage my VMs, I haven't verified that this workaround works.\n\n*With regard to what the flow of control looks like, tuxradar has a pretty good article. Here's the diagram from that article: .\n\nDay 2\n\n*\n\n*I got my VM to boot. I ran vmbuilder --debug --verbose with this as my config file in /etc/vmbuilder.cfg. I ran the most basic partition setup. Use google to see what to put in the vmbuilder.partition file. This takes a long time and I couldn't figure out how to install apt-proxy. If you can install apt-proxy, I would do it.\n\n\n*Still can't get networking to work. The guest OS can't see the host OS and vice versa.\n", "Q: What is curl used for in Ruby?

So can anyone tell me what exactly curl is?  Thanks!\n\nNote: Reading this guide is highly recommended before you install Ruby (thanks Damien).\n\n\nA: CURL is needed for rvm, specifically it is used for the installer script (which is made to be 'run everywhere'), and since Mac doesn't ship with wget but does with curl, they use curl.\nFrom CURL man page\n\ncurl  is  a tool to transfer data from or to a server, using one of\n  the supported protocols (DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, HTTP, HTTPS,\n  IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP,LDAPS, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMTP,\n  SMTPS, TELNET and TFTP).

I have my account plus the guess account for my kids on this computer and if any of the account is logged in when the command to shutdown is given the computer will not even attempt to shutdown. The only way to shut it down if one of the account still logged is by logging out all accounts first and then providing the command from the login screen. I will shut down fine from terminal using the \"shutdown -h now\" command. Unfortunately I have still much to learn in order to attempt to correct this issue on my own.\n\nA: I can't comment, so I'll post this as an answer:\nI had the same issue on my 12.04 recently; in my case, it was due to one program (in my case pcscd) that wasn't stopped properly at shutdown and caused a 'cpu-lockup'. So, to turn of the splash screen (the ubuntu with the five dots):\n\n\n*\n\n*hit 'escape' when you shutdown your computer. \n\n*you can disable splash in GRUB, but since you don't have that...\nWhat messages are displayed on the screen? (look for something like \"some process PID locks ...\" (I forgot what the exact terms are...). If necessary, you can take a picture and post it here.\nIf you can confirm a process not being stopped normally, we can proceed by stopping it at shutdown via runlevel commands\n\nA: I solved this problem by logging out first, then shutting down from the login screen.  Shutting down without logging out first was resulting in a black screen, but with the power on the computer still on.  I have Ubuntu set up with only one user so I'm not sure what's causing this problem.  I haven't had a look to see if there are any processes running that are preventing shutdown as I'm very new to Linux and I don't actually know how to do that. A bit of searching will probably reveal the solution but if anyone can enlighten me here that would be great.\n\nA: I did have this problem and still have it in one way, but some improvement has occurred.\nUntil now, I had to press for a few seconds the start/shut down button from my Easynote ENTG71GM Packard bell /ACer.

I couldn't figure out first what a terminal was... Så it wasn't in any case a waste of time.\nMy partial solution: I read on a thread that there was a problem with ELAN. I remembered that Windows 10 made me install some ELAN something. Sorry I don't know what it is. It didn't change a thing in W 10 so I forgot about it. Yesterday, I read the tread, Went on W 10, got read of ELAN and now my EasyNote shuts down properly when I reboot from Ubuntu.\nThe problem is that it reboots even when I chose to shut down.\nHowever and since so many of you are helpful I thought that this I could spend some time to write this note.

However the name suggests a reference to it. Anyhow I do not suggest to install or run any component from the referenced archive.\n\nA: There are no partitions. They are an attempt by fdisk to read partition info where there is none - there's just data there being misinterpreted instead. Data may have been copied to a disk that was formatted but not ever partitioned. \nTo mount entired non-partitioned disk:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/test\nsudo chmod 755 /mnt/test\nmount -t ntfs /dev/sda /mnt/test\n\n(NOT: mount -t ntfs /dev/sda1 /mnt/test)\n\nA: If you have come so far as you see Bootsecure II\nProbably by using mkfs.ntfs /dev/sda x \nwhere value of x is sectors. found using blockdev --getsz\nThis can be achieved with using fdisk then s for sun partition.\nThen you just change the cluster up to a max of 104756 with x value.\nand format with mkfs.ntfs max sectors with -F on a valid non hacked system.\nas using mkfs.ntfs /dev/sda !set value of blockdev! !important sda! -F -H 255 -S 63 -p 0 \nThen you simply use sudo fdisk /dev/sda1\nset to g as partition gtp.\nand delete partition or set a new one with n and push w\nthen youre SSD of value 250gb might see 6.2TB\nNow use you magic\nset new partitions one with value 1G making 512GB\nnext with 2G with 1TB\nSecond will be set as 4.6TB automatic.\nNow use sudo mkfs.ntfs /dev/tty10 1073735000 -H 255 -S 63 -p 2048 -F\nthen when format is done... after several hours.\nsudo mkfs.ntfs /dev/tty11 3221220000 -p 1073743872 -H 255 -S 63 -F\nset 3221220000 as value with 5000 less on last fdisk for second drive sectors\nvalue p a little higher.\nlast format will go like this:\nsudo mkfs.ntfs /dev/tty12 9188240000 -p 4294970295 -H 255 -S 63 -F\nlook at the drive led... kinda strange wouldn't it be?...\n", "Q: Why is Muon on KDE failing with multiple package errors?

When you are asked, choose \"run live CD\" and wait until you see the desktop. In the Live session, you can access any HD, USB drive, etc... you want. If you want, you can reinstall the Ubuntu OS.\n", "Q: Windows boot options menu error I had windows 7 installed on my Laptop, I tried installing Ubuntu 12.04 via Bootable CD for trial. I am still able to run Ubuntu Live through the CD, but I was unable to install.\nThe installation process got completed only after selecting a partition disk and making it \"ext 2\" type. However after installation I do not see any boot menu. I even tried windows repair, that does not seem to work though. Also, I am not able to see any of the disk partition when I want to reinstall windows in any of the 7 partitions. \nHow do I do that? I just gave a try on secondary laptop in order to make sure it works. I am not keen to have Ubuntu on this particular machine, I just want to have windows back without loss of any data. How do I do that? \n\nA: First thing to do is Backup your Linux files, if you have any.  After that is done, boot with the Ubuntu live CD, and delete every Linux partition. Boot, swap, and any other partitions that you may have created. \nThe Linux partitions don’t have a file system associated with them, and can be identifyed by size or partition number.  Once you do that, GRUB is gone, and you need to restore the MBR(Master Boot Record).\nYou would now need to boot Boot from Windows CD/DVD and choose “Startup Repair” when it shows up.   \n\nIf the Startup Repair option does not resolve the issue, choose Command Prompt and run the following two commands: \nbootrec /fixmbr \n\nbootrec /fixboot \n\nRemove the CD, restart your system, and you should be able to boot into your Windows installation. \nTo re-claim the space that was used by Ubuntu, again use the Ubuntu live CD, run GParted, and re-size you partition with the empty space that was occupied by Ubuntu.\nYou said that you have the Windows CD, but just in case you don't have your Windows 7 CD, or you can't find it, you can download a Windows 7 Recovery Disc, you can download it.

After the system starts, in a few minutes my memory cache fills up and it starts using the swap. Here's a screenshot of /proc/meminfo. \n\nHowever, if I can disable this process / clean the cache once after that, I think my system will speed up to some extent. Correct me if I am wrong here.\nI have also tried Bleachbit memory cleaning, but it doesn't seem to clean the memory cache properly. Also, the feature is still in an experimental stage. \n\nThere was already a similar question posted here: How can I disable the prefetch cache?, but it was regarding Ubuntu Server, and also the answers involved manual settings etc. \nSo, I want to know if there's some software for disabling/enabling Memory Cache for Ubuntu 12.04. \n\nA: To Check your Current Memory Usage \n watch -n 1 free -m\n\nor\n watch -n 1 cat /proc/meminfo\n\nTo Free Up Space\n sudo sysctl -w vm.drop_caches=3\n\nNOTE: this action won't make your system faster nor it will affect its stability and performance, it will just clean up memory used by the Linux Kernel on caches.\nor \n sudo sync && echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n\nNOTE: You can use cron jobs to schedule the commands above to run at specific time intervals.\n\nA: \nNote: Linux is NOT \"eating\" your RAM! Please take a look at Geirha's excellent answer below to understand why...\n\nAfter the above note, if you still feel \"cleaning\" the cache could help, you can certainly try: it's a one-liner from the terminal:\nsync && echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n\nThere's no easy way to disable the cache, but you can achieve the same effect by cleaning it as often as every minute, if you want to:\n\n*\n\n*Make it a cron-job\n\n\n*Press Alt-F2, type gksudo gedit /etc/crontab, and add this line near the bottom:\n*/15 *    * * *   root    sync && echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n\n\n*This cleans every 15 minutes. You can set to 1 or 5 minutes if you really want to  by changing the first parameter to * or */5 instead of */15\nOne liner to know REAL free RAM, excepting cache\nGeirha's answer explains the details, but in short, you get the number of free megabytes with:\nfree -m | sed -n -e '3p' | grep -Po \"\\d+$\"\n\nwhich on my 2GB command-line server returns an extremely health 1835.\n\nA: Help! Linux ate my RAM!\nwww.linuxatemyram.com explains this beautifully in FAQ form, with the essentials being:\n\nWhat's going on?\nLinux is borrowing unused memory for disk caching. This makes it looks like you are low on memory, but you are not! Everything is fine!\nWhy is it doing this?\nDisk caching makes the system much faster! There are no downsides, except for confusing newbies. It does not take memory away from applications in any way, ever!\nWhat if I want to run more applications?\nIf your applications want more memory, they just take back a chunk that the disk cache borrowed. Disk cache can always be given back to applications immediately! You are not low on ram!\nHow do I see how much free ram I really have?\nTo see how much ram your applications could use without swapping, run free -m and look at the \"available\" column:\n   \n$ free -m\n              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available\nMem:           1504        1491          13           0         855      792\nSwap:          2047           6        2041\n\n  This is your answer in mebibytes.\n\n\nSource: as mentioned, the excellent www.linuxatemyram.com -- please visit for more information.\n\nA: As we can see the cashing not a problem\njust if it cause swapping, what you can avoid by managing the vm.swappiness value.\nMaybe that's what you looking for:\nwhy-is-swap-being-used-even-though-i-have-plenty-of-free-ram\n", "Q: Using Alt+Tab in Remmina RDP connection In Ubuntu 12.04, I want to use Alt+Tab in remote PC connected using Remmina by RDP connection.

I've tried killing pulseaudio, this doesn't work, I've also tried uninstalling pulseaudio, this does more damage than it fixes, and didn't solve the problem, so I re-installed pulseaudio, opened up winecfg, and set all devices to pulseaudio, but this still didn't fix the problem.\nWhat am I doing wrong, or what is Wine doing wrong, and how can I fix it?\n\nA: I am no expert on wine, but I read this on Facebook earlier, let me know if it helps :\n\nMarvin Mallari posted to Ubuntu 15 hours ago - For people having sound\n  problems with Wine (like sound is garbled, static, non existant) in\n  Ubuntu 12.04 (w/ Unity and Pulse/ALSA) i found a solution. Go to\n  Synaptic Package Manager, install \"ia32-libs-multiarch\", it will ask\n  to modify or install other packages, install all packages and restart\n  (not log out then log in) Wine should now play audio perfectly and\n  stable. note: i did this on a 32bit comp, for 64bit, there is probably\n  a different package or maybe the package will work because it says\n  \"multiarch\" i will try on my 64bit machine later. PS i don't have an\n  account on any Wine or Ubuntu fourms so if someone can please share\n  this somewhere that needs it that would be much appreciated!\nMarvin Mallari - Ia32 probably isn't the solution but when I read the\n  addition packages synaptic modifies and installs, a couple of them are\n  for pulse so it is probably those packages that fixed it but in any\n  case ia32 installed whatever it needed to work.

The check_ping command just validates the availability of a system via an ICMP ping packet.  See  this page for details on it's usage: http://nagiosplugins.org/man/check_ping\nInstead, I believe you'll need to use the check_http command to verify the web server is responding.  Here is a link to it's usage: http://nagiosplugins.org/man/check_http\nFrom the recently added config file, you have this:\ndefine host{\n        use                     linux-server\n        host_name               example.com/ui/html\n        alias                   example.com/ui/html\n        address                 www.example.com/ui/html/\n        }\n\nThe address and host_name lines are incorrect. \n\n\n*\n\n*The host_name should be www.example.com, assuming that's the system name you're hoping to monitor.\n\n*The address should be the IP address of the same machine, not the name and portion of the URL.\n\n\nBoth of those notes are based on the information in http://nagios.manubulon.com/traduction/docs25en/macros.html\n", "Q: How do I sudo a command in a script without being asked for a password? I want to turn my system on automatically every day. So I use the below code in my Python script, but sudo asks me for a password every time:\nos.system('sudo sh -c \"echo date \\'+%s\\' -d \\'+ \\\n       24 hours\\' > /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm\"')\n\nHow can I run this script without sudo asking for the password every time?\n\nA: \nWarning!\nPutting your login password in plain text, in a command or file, is extremely insecure and can compromise your private data and your system. It is highly recommended never to do this even if you think your system is \"personal\" or in a \"safe location\"!\n\nIf the script is only for personal use and you have placed it in a safe place and you are not afraid of your account being stolen and such, then here's a simple solution:\necho LOGINPASSWD | sudo -S COMMAND HERE\n\nwhere LOGINPASSWD is your login password (example: iloveponies)\nand COMMAND HERE is your command that comes after sudo, like sh -c \"echo da.. etc\n\nA: If you don't mind the script running at a specific time on the hour (or during the day), put it inside root's home directory (/root), and run the script from the system crontab (/etc/crontab) as root. Then you won't have to compromise your security.\nSee https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto for how to add the script to the crontab.\n\nA: \nPlease note: Any method which involves putting your login password in plain text, in a command or in a file, is insecure and should NOT be used!\n\nThe correct way to do it to setup sudo such that only the one specific command you need, i.e. echo date... > rtc..., is allowed to run WITHOUT needing the password. \nStep 1. Create a shell script with just that command\n\n\n*\n\n*Open up gedit (or your favorite editor), and create the script e.g. pydatertc.sh\n\n*Insert only this line, and save it to, e.g. your home directory:\necho date \\'+%s\\' -d \\'+ 24 hours\\' > /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm\n\n*Quit the editor, and from the terminal, make the script executable and change its ownership to root, otherwise another user with access to your system could possibly edit it and execute whatever commands they want as root without needing your password:\nsudo chown root:root /home/username/pydatertc.sh\nsudo chmod 700 /home/username/pydatertc.sh\n\nStep 2. Set up sudo to allow pydatertc.sh to execute without requiring a password\n\n\n*\n\n*Type sudo visudo at the terminal to open the sudo permissions (sudoers) file\n\n*Around line 25, you'll see this line: %sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL\n\n*Below that line, insert the following line, where username is your username:\nusername  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /home/username/pydatertc.sh\n\n*Exit the editor (Ctrl+X if nano)\n\n\nStep 3. Modify your python script to call pydatertc.sh\n\n\n*\n\n*Change the line to:\nos.system('sudo /home/username/pydatertc.sh')\nNow your script should run without requiring a password AND without compromising the security of your account, your data or your system!\n\nAlternative only for wakealarm (not for general use!):\nIn this specific case only, since the /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm file only controls the wake-up alarm for the system and is otherwise harmless, another alternative to avoid the password is either to take ownership of that file with chown (if you are the only user setting the alarm), or make it world-writeable with chmod +666; in that case, simply remove the sudo from your Python call, leaving sh -c \"....\" intact.\n\nA: Another related nice feature of sudo which hasn't been mentioned in the excellent answers above is the 'timestamp_timeout' variable.  It is a sudo variable which you may increase to save on interactive password typing.\nExample, in /etc/sudoers (or one of the files included from it) you may modify the default:\n# only require a password once every 60 minutes\nDefaults timestamp_timeout=60\n\nFull description from 'man sudoers':\n\ntimestamp_timeout\n        Number of minutes that can elapse before sudo will ask for\n        a passwd again.  The default is 5, set this to 0 to always\n        prompt for a password.\n\n\nOf course, this cannot help in the specific case of running the command from cron.\nBut it is a good thing to be aware of.\n\nA: export MY_SUDO_PASS=\"user_password_here\"\n\nTo test if it's working type:\necho $MY_SUDO_PASS\n> user_password_here\n\nTo run \"sudo apt-get update\", and accept password from environment variables what we created before:\necho $MY_SUDO_PASS | sudo -S apt-get update\n\nRun from python (example changing directory ownership recursively to username_here):\npython\n>> import subprocess\n>> subprocess.call('echo $MY_SUDO_PASS | sudo -S chown -R username_here /home/username_here/folder_to_change_ownership_recursivley', shell=True)\n\n\necho $MY_SUDO_PASS get's password -S switch catching it and passing the password to sudo\n", "Q: Will Ubuntu work on a GPT-partitioned 3TB disk?

When the user launches a window, I want to start the Twisted server I wrote. However, when I do this, it freezes the GUI, because the reactor.run method is constantly running after it is started. I need a way to start the Twisted reactor in its own thread, so that the GUI will continue to operate while the reactor is running. I have read about using Twisted with pyGTK in the Twisted documentation, but I am not sure how I would accomplish this with a Quickly application. What is the best way to start my Twisted server when a window opens without freezing the GUI?\nUpdate:\nMy if __name__ == '__main__' statement at the end of my dialog file is:\nprint 'Preparing GLib'\nGLib.idle_add(before_running)\nprint 'Staring Reactor'\nfrom twisted.internet import reactor\nreactor.run()`\n\nI have imported and installed twisted.gtk3reactor earlier on in the file. The before_running method contains dialog = ClientDialog() and dialog.show, as well as the rest of the code I want to run when the dialog opens. \n\nA: If you are using the python-gi bindings on 12.04 or newer, you need to import and install the twisted.internet.gireactor or twisted.internet.gtk3reactor, before doing the reactor.run(). You also need to use this as your main loop, rather than running Gtk.main() or a GLib.MainLoop().run() yourself. If you are on an older version and using the old PyGTK+ bindings, then you need to use either glib2reactor or gtk2reactor.\nSomething like this:\nfrom twisted.internet import gtk3reactor\nfrom gi.repository import GLib\ngtk3reactor.install()\n\nGLib.idle_add(create_windows_and_do_stuff_method)\nfrom twisted.internet import reactor\n\nreactor.run()\n\nThe sequence is important, as importing the default reactor will result in it being installed, rather than the appropriate reactor, if a reactor is not already installed. Thus you need to install the proper one first, then do the reactor.run(). And instead of Gtk.main_quit(), you should from twisted.internet import reactor and use reactor.stop().\n", "Q: Websites running on server showing virus warnings I am running Plesk 9.5 on Ubuntu 8.04 LTS and have about 15 websites infected with some malicious code appended to the end of java files.

I tried installing Office 2007 in Ubuntu with Wine but it was throwing an error after installing and also when I tried to open a PowerPoint document and save it. Has anybody gotten Office 2007 installed without any issues? Please help me.\n\nA: Definitely yes, in Wine 1.5.\nDetails on the WineHQ site: here. \nThat is my source, I'll add instructions from there.\n(Pay attention to what they say there, like: \"There are many howtos for installing Office 2007 floating about the internet. These howtos are rarely maintained by their authors, and because of the rapid rate of Wine development, even ones that were accurate at the time they were posted quickly become outdated.\nIn the case of Office 2007, many of these outside howtos call for installing a long list of winetricks that are unnecessary to install in current Wine. Some of these tweaks can, in fact, prevent Office apps from working properly. \nThe only howto for installing Office 2007 that is supported here is the one on this page.\"\n\"­No overrides are nee­ded to install Microsoft Office 2007. However to get Microsoft Office 2007 to run correctly once it has been installed some overrides may be necessary. See below for instructions.\"\n\"Do not install riched20 with winetricks. Office 2007 installs its own version of riched20.\")\nBecause myself had already installed those long lists of winetricks mentioned above, I had to uninstall and reinstall Wine completely before proceeding as stated below.\nThe problems appear with certain versions of Wine.\nThe solution is to keep oneself updated to the WineHQ instructions.\nLatest versions of Wine are best. Also, latest versions of Office (2007 and 2010) are easier to install than the older ones.\nThe safest would be to install Office 2007 after a fresh installation of Wine 1.5 (present latest: I will update in time).\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-wine/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install wine1.5\n\nGo to Menu, 'Configure Wine' and make sure your version of wine is set to Windows XP.\n\nInstall Office 2007.\n(Open the disk and right click on setup.exe and select \"Open with wine windows program loader.\")\nThe progress bar in the installer window may stop when it reaches about 2/3 of the way. The installation is continuing, even though the progress bar is not moving. Wait for it to finish.\nAfter installation:\nIn 'Configure Wine', under the Libraries tab in the area labeled \"New override for library\" type in riched20.dll and click on Add.\nYou will see it appear in the list below. Now select the riched20 in the list that we just added and click on the Edit button.\nSet it to Native (Windows) and click OK.\n\nThis will allow Powerpoint and the other applications to run correctly.\n\nWhat comes bellow I did it beyond what what the above site says, so it might involve certain risks. It seems that it is very important not to use winetricks and so on before installing as stated here and at the WineHQ address.\n\nOptionally, what I did was to install all fonts and improve appearance like here.\nAlso, I like to have the classic menus (XP/2003) at hand, added in  a tab beside the new ones: there are different addons for that but the one I use in Windows7 doesn't seem to work in Wine so I have installed this, which is add-supported. (Please give me a comment with a link to one that is cleaner and works as expected if you find one.) \n\nThe SaveAsPDFandXPS add-in appears to be working as expected.\n\nA: You could give playonlinux a try. It has fairly decent office 2007 tools. Just start playonlinux and install office 2007 using either cd or an .exe file. Under 12.10 it works relatively fine, but it does not support typing Hebrew, Arabic and so (unless you configure them). Also installing add-ons (bibliography managers and the like) is all but obvious. \n\nA: You can install MS Office 2007, with the help of PlayOnLinux. PlayOnLinux is a graphical front-end for the Wine software compatibility layer which aims to simplify the installation of Windows-based applications.\n\n1. Installation of PlayOnLinux \n\nYou can install PlayOnLinux from Ubuntu Software Center\n\nor open a Terminal with Ctrl + Alt + T and type:\nsudo apt-get install playonlinux and fill in your password.\n\nThen type Y or yes and hit Enter ↵ to install the package.\n\nAfter a while you will need to accept the EULA of mscorefonts. To select the OK option, hit  ⇆ TAB  and then Enter ↵.\n\n\nWhen the installation process is finished open PlayOnLinux from dash\n\nThe first time you open it, click Next to set up the PlayOnLinux environment.\n \n\nAfter that everything is set up. \n\n2. Mount *.iso or CD-ROM \n\nAt this momment, you need to mount the .iso or place in the CD that contains the MS Office 2007.\nIf you have a .iso file open a Terminal and type \nsudo mkdir /media/office07 With this command you'll create a folder with the name office07 in /media.\nNext type \nsudo mount -o loop ~/filename.iso /media/office07 to mount the image into our new directory.\n\n3. Install MS Office 2007 \n\nNow switch on PlayonLinux window and click on the button Install to install a new software.\n\nNext, go on the category Office, choose Microsoft Office 2007 and click in the button Install.\n\nHit Next\n\nAfter some time you will be asked to install Gecko Installer. Hit the Install button.\n\nWhen the installation of Gecko Installer is finished you will have to choose where is your CD/.iso is mounted and click Next.\n\nAt last continue as usually\n\nWhen you finish with installation you will have three new shortcuts in your desktop (Word, Excel, Powerpoint)\n\n\nA: Yes, wine supports installing Office 2007. I recently installed it on my laptop and as you said, it didn't give any errors while installing but when you try to save and close the document, it pops up 2-3 error messages, which if you read carefully, can be safely ignored. However, as you said, PowerPoint does not seem to start easily from the dash. To open PowerPoint, open a Terminal and go the path where you have installed Office and type\nwine PPTVIEW.EXE\nTo locate where you have installed Office, type\nlocate PPTVIEW.EXE\non the terminal, which will indirectly give you the path where Office is installed.\nIf you are not able to open a document, then please post the output of\nwine /home/$USER/.wine/drive_c/Program\\ Files\\ \\(x86\\)/Microsoft\\ Office/Office12/PPTVIEW.EXE\n\nof whatever path Office is installed on as a comment to this answer.\n\nA: As of Wine 1.6.2 through Wine devel 1.9.16, Excel 2007 runs without any Play on Linux. Macros work, but there are few weird oddities:\n\n\n*\n\n*The file open/save dialogs lack any attributes - only the filenames are displayed. This is a know issue dating since 2013.\n\n\n*The exact same .xlsx file that opens perfectly fine in the exact same copy of MS Office 2007 installed in an XP SP3 VM, fails to open in Excel on Wine, with the message that it found \"unreadable content\" (trying to recover fails with The workbook cannot be opened or repaired by Microsoft Except because it is corrupt.):\n\n", "Q: PSensors don't detect all sensors On windows I can see my CPU sensor, but in Ubuntu, using PSensor, I can't see CPU sensor. It detects GPU sensor (which I don't have) and it detects CPU usage.

Now run this command: sudo service module-init-tools restart  Now check the temperatures using sensors -s command on terminal. If it works.. restart psensors. If not, follow this page and see if it helps. Link: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1933020\n\nYou might also want to see this page: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SensorInstallHowto\n\nA: As already said by drake01, Psensor is 'just' a GUI front-end on top of few libraries providing temperature information. \nFor mother-board it uses lm-sensors, basically you need to install it (the package is lm-sensors), then run 'sensors-detect' as root. You will find more information at lm-sensors FAQ or Psensor installation. \nIf the command 'sensors' displays some temperature sensors but not Psensor, feel free to report a bug to me (jeanfi@gmail.com). If 'sensors' reports no temperature sensors, your hardware is not supported or you should ask the lm-sensors team.\nThere are many other tools similar to Psensor, for example Xsensors or the excellent indicator-sensors from Alex Murray. Anyway, there are all based on lm-sensors, so the first step is to have lm-sensors running correctly.\n", "Q: separate panels in unity 5 on precise?

Tried several online links for installing windows OS on Ubuntu using Virtual Box and also for installing virtual box.\nThe virtual box is installed correctly as per my thinking.\n\nA: Is the hard drive image still attacked to the virtual machine? If not, attach it as a SATA controller.\n\n\nA: This is not related to Ubuntu. This is an error within Virtual Box.\nThe meaning of the error message is that your virtual machine can't find any bootable media.\nMake sure you specify in you virtual machine that it should search your physical dvd drive for the install dvd, or point it to the iso file containing your Windows7 install and it should work.\n\nA: Got the answer, as mentioned above.

That is all functioning well.\nMy problem is that the launcher pops out for maybe 5 seconds before hiding.

I am trying to configure Python2.7 on Ubuntu 10.04 as an alternative package.\nI got the Deadsnakes PPA\nI set up pip and virtualenv\nNow, I am trying to build PyQt (PySide seems to have similar problems in that pip is not supported)\nI have activated virtualenv and have downloaded SIP.\n(qtenv)~/sip-4.13.3$ python2.7 configure.py\n\n(qtenv)~/sip-4.13.3$ make\n\ngcc -c -pipe -fPIC -O2 -w -DNDEBUG -I. -I/usr/include/python2.7 -o siplib.o siplib.c\nsiplib.c:20:20: error: Python.h: No such file or directory\n\nand of course now there is a cornucopia of errors after that\nSupposedly, I would need python-dev for the Python headers but I already have it installed in regular enviroment(python 2.6 on Ubuntu 10.04). \nSo how do I get the headers file for python2.7 builds?\nIt seems I am only a few steps away from shaving the yak...\n\nFor other readers, a synopsis...\nThe OP is running Ubuntu 10.4 (which by default uses an older version of Python2.6) but wants Python2.7 and the PyQt package, which depends on the SIP package (from the authors of PyQt.)\nThe OP has installed and is using virtualenv, which lets you have multiple versions of Python installed.\nPyQt is a binding from Python to the Qt C library. Its installation requires compilation against the Python header files (e.g. Python.h which is found e.g. in /usr/local/include/python2.6, or ...2.7)\nA standard installation of Ubuntu does not have those Python header files. They can be installed as package python-dev, but they will match the installed version of Python e.g. 2.6.\nEvidently the OP has installed python-dev for Python2.6 (and the virtualenv can see it). The OP changed directory to the SIP directory and ran the configure script, but since it was executed by Python2.7, it configured the make scripts for SIP to look for Python2.7 header files. The OP needs to install python-dev package for Python2.7 into their second, virtual, Python environment that is running Python2.7.\n(I am also trying to build SIP and PyQt on Ubuntu 12.04 and it is also failing to find /usr/local/include/Python.h. I installed python-dev which installed to /usr/include/python2.7. Maybe the configure script for PyQt is flawed. This is a common problem on Linux, that there is no absolutely standard place to install things, especially when multiple versions of a thing might be installed.)\n\nA: You need the python2.7-dev package from the same PPA. Header files foo a package foo are generally in foo-dev.\n", "Q: Problems starting to use Launchpad I've been reading the different tutorials that Launchpad directs you to.

The bzr tool doesn't care what is in it, but it handles textual content best (e.g. any source code) but it can also upload images, audio, video and more.\nWhen you create a new directory for a project and you want it to be a bzr branch, be sure to initialize it so bzr can track it in with version control (if you are using Quickly to create your app, it already did this for you).\nTo initialize it run:\ncd <your project directory>\nbzr init\n\nIf you are pushing to bzr push lp:~clem11388/pictureadventure/trunk it also presumes http://launchpad.net/pictureadventure exists (which it looks like it does). \n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu 12.04 via SSH?

Still nothing for Chrome\n\nA: Many answers are now dated.  They did not work for my 14.04 Ubuntu install.  For my instance of chrome is installed in /opt/google/chrome.  So the plugin folder would have to be created in there.\nUpdated instructions can be found at https://www.java.com/en/download/help/enable_browser_ubuntu.xml\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a directory called plugins if you do not have it. Type: \nmkdir -p /opt/google/chrome/plugins\n\n*Go to Google chrome plugins directory before you make the symbolic link. Type: \ncd /opt/google/chrome/plugins\n\n*Create a symbolic link.

A proposed update was released for the icedtea-6-plugin package and confirmed to work. This should land in a few days for all users.\nMeanwhile, you can use a different browser as others suggested, Firefox works here.\n\nA: The best solution I found, (none of these suggestions worked for me), is as followings:\nFirst install Icedtead pluging by:\n\n\n*\n\n*1) sudo apt-get install icedtea-7-plugin\nThen in your chrome browser go to:\n\n\n*\n\n*2) chrome-> Settings-> Show Advanced Settings-> Privacy then click on\nContent Settings -> Plug-ins then click on Disable Individual Plug-in\n\n*3) Disable both \"IceTea-Web Plugin\" and \"Java(TM)\"\n\n*4) Restart the browser.\n\n*5) chrome-> Settings-> Show Advanced Settings-> Privacy then click on\nContent Settings -> Plug-ins then click on Disable Individual Plug-in\n\n*6) Enable only \"IceTea-Web Plugin\"\n\n*7) Enjoy !\n\n\nA: Alternate install Java for Chrome, can also install icedtea:\n sudo apt-get install icedtea-7-plugin\n\nThen link icedtea in to chromium plugin folder thusly\ncd /usr/lib/chromium-browser/plugins\n\nand link\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/amd64/IcedTeaPlugin.so \n\n\nA: I've been having the same problem. After digging around for a while, I found that Chrome is a 32 bit application that does not have support for 64 bit Java. (A related issue is explained by Oracle here.)\nThis means you would have to install a 32 bit version of Java (basically Java 6) on your system. I personally have given up on the venture, but this older question might be of some help.\n\nA: Java plug-in is not working anymore on Chrome (versions 45+). From here:\n\nNPAPI support by Chrome\nThe Java plug-in for web browsers relies on the cross platform plugin\narchitecture NPAPI, which has long been, and currently is, supported\nby all major web browsers. Google announced in September 2013 plans to\nremove NPAPI support from Chrome by \"the end of 2014\", thus\neffectively dropping support for Silverlight, Java, Facebook Video and\nother similar NPAPI based plugins. Recently, Google has revised their\nplans and now state that they plan to completely remove NPAPI by late\n2015. As it is unclear if these dates will be further extended or not, we strongly recommend Java users consider alternatives to Chrome as\nsoon as possible. Instead, we recommend Firefox, Internet Explorer and\nSafari as longer-term options.\n\n\nA: In my case, Chromium was not starting the app, no messages, just a grey box appearing where the app would be, so it was doing something, but not enough.  Which sounds similar to OP. Non-browser java apps had previously been running ok on my system.\nAn article somewhere suggested using which javac to determine installed status.  This generated no terminal output.  So I tried just calling javac, and got the list of installer packages for java.  So I think I had some sort of limited install, no idea what or why.\nExecuted sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk and then re-enabled the icedtea Chromium plugin (via Settings | Advanced Settings | Privacy | Content settings | Disable individual plugins) which I had disabled earlier while trying other things.  There were no other Java plugins in the list.\nTa-dah!  Java apps now working in Chrome.  I can't remember how or whence I installed Java previously, but it was likely a 'least resistance' approach, so I suspect some others may also have the same system state.\n", "Q: Touchscreen no longer working on Dell Latitude 2120 I initially had Ubuntu 10.10 installed on my netbook, the touch-screen worked completely fine however the distribution upgrade to 12.04 has resulted in my touch-screen no longer working.\nlsusb lists many of my other devices properly, but also has this\n\nBus 004 Device 002: ID 1cb6:6651  \n\nwhich I believe to be my Touch-screen.

I am looking for a feature similar to that existed in Earlier Ubuntu releases (until Ubuntu Lucid AFAIK).\nThe feature was, When I click on the drive icon on the left side bar of nautilus, NTFS drives get mounted and when I want to run any script and/or executable files on that drive, The nautilus display a message asking \"Whether it should display the file, or Run or Open in terminal etc\" like the following image\n\nIt seems, that feature is removed since Ubuntu 10.10.\nMy question is How can I configure nautilus to do that kind of mounting with exec permission? or In other words, \"How can I get that feature back in precise?\"\nI am asking this question because, I have to run several executable scripts in NTFS partition and don't want to mount it automatically with fstab and also with terminal.\n\nNote:\nI can mount the NTFS drives with exec permission from terminal using this simple command:\nudisks --mount /dev/sda2 --mount-options umask=022\n\nSo, I am sure that, they can be mounted with executable permission. I just do not like to mount them using terminal, I can also add a script in the startup, but I want to know, How to configure to do this.\nAlso, I don't think, it is a bug, since that feature existed in the Ubuntu 10.04 and was working greatly. I think, this is a change in default policy, which I need to find.\n\nA: Before Ubuntu 10.04 HAL was used to mount removable devices instead of udev. So, by configuring /usr/share/hal/fdi/policy/10osvendor/25-ntfs-3g-policy.fdi i.e. adding \n\n<merge key=\"volume.policy.mount_option.exec\"\n  type=\"bool\">true</merge>\n\nunder the \n\n<match key=\"volume.fstype\" string=\"ntfs\">\n\nsection, one could automate mounting them with exec permission, but now with udev you can write an udev-rule like\n\nKERNEL=\"sd*|hd*\", ACTION==\"add\", ENV{ID_FS_TYPE}==\"ntfs\", ENV{pmount_options}=\"%E{pmount_options}  -t ntfs-3g --umask 022\"\n\nto mount ntfs partitions with executable permission. \nCreate a rule file in /etc/udev/rules.d. Under /etc/udev/rules.d the udev .rule files should be named in the same manner as for init scripts, i.e. priority-filename.rule form. Whenever a sdxy or hdxy is added to your system with ID_FS_TYPE device key matching to ntfs then this rule sets the pmount options.

Well, technically it's a login shell that starts a GUI, but that's getting in to jargon. And yes, it will read the settings in .profile\nThe only time you (a normal user) will probably see a login shell that looks like a login shell is if you are having some problem with your desktop and you switch to a virtual terminal with the Ctrl+Alt+F1 shortcut.\n\nThe other general cases for having a login shell include:\n\n*\n\n*accessing your computer remotely via ssh (or connecting locally with ssh localhost)\n\n*simulating an initial login shell with bash -l (or sh -l)\n\n*simulating an initial root login shell with sudo -i\n\n*\n\n*or sudo -u username -i for another non-root user\n\n\n\n*authenticating as another non-root user with su - username (and their password)\n\n*using the sudo login command to switch user\n\n\nA: I do not think that correct answer can be given without “technical jargon”. Since this question is the first one popping up in Google for the query “what is a login shell” I am providing a more correct answer below:\nLogin shell is simply a shell that was told to be a login shell. It does not mean shell that pops up after you login, though usually application that logs you in is telling shell it launches to be a login shell. There exists the following ways to tell shell it should be a login one:\n\n\n*\n\n*Running shell with -l or --login argument assuming it knows it (I do not know any shells which do not know -l, but --login is only supported by a few shells).\n\n*Running shell with argv[0] set to -{some_string} (i.e. with HYPHEN-MINUS prepended to usual argv[0] or to some other string). This is what ssh and su do: su just runs executable with -su as argv[0] (hello to everybody thinking argv[0] has something to do with currently running executable name), ssh runs zsh with -zsh when user has set /bin/zsh as his shell.\n\n\nLoginess of the shell has absolutely nothing to do with anybody asking you a password or performing some other authenication procedure. Some programs like ssh or login (or some terminal emulators like urxvt) run shells as a login ones using argv[0] that starts with a HYPHEN-MINUS. Some like su or sudo (or zsh: see - precommand modifier described in section PRECOMMAND MODIFIERS in man zshmisc) do not do this by default, but can be told so. Some have the only option of telling shell to be the login one using its argument (i.e. bash -l): ssh with a command argument (that explicitly tells ssh what to run on the remote end).\nGenerally it is better to first consult the documentation of the program used to invoke the shell to determine whether shell will be the login one and second perform some tests to determine whether app will launch a login shell (e.g. by adding echo to .profile).\n", "Q: Synchronize wireless passwords between computers Is it possible to synchronize wireless network passwords between multiple computers running Ubuntu? It would save me a lot of time if I didn't need to re-enter every wireless password whenever I started using a new Ubuntu installation.\n\nA: There may be some obscure way of doing this - there usually is with Linux!\nHowever, what I do is to use LastPass with Firefox. It stores browser passwords but also has a secure note facility. Because it is the first thing I install, I effectively use it for sharing key settings including passwords.\nOf course, this doesn't help if you have to install machines using only WiFi! In that case, I recommend simply putting the password in an obscure text file on a USB key while doing installs, then delete it. To add security, you could use a cross-platform security tool such as KeePass. Just make sure that you have the appropriate platform application on the key as well.\n", "Q: How do I get Ubuntu to not mount my encrypted partitions on boot? I'm using dm-crypt and LVM, which I set up during installation. I have two volume groups, one of which is encrypted and not needed for system/boot purposes. As of now, Ubuntu asks for a password on boot to mount the encrypted volumes. The computer in question will be remotely administered, so I won't be able to enter any password on boot.\nIdeally I would like it to boot normally without asking for a password, after which I could ssh in and mount the encrypted volume manually. I suspect this involves creating a new initramfs, but I'm not sure.\nAny hints as to what I need to do to not have to enter a password on boot?\n\nA: You should specify this on /etc/crypttab, like this -\n\n{encrypted-block-device} {block-device} none noauto\n\nExplanation:\nencrypted-block-device - This is the device you setup using cryptsetup under /dev/mapper/\nblock-device - this is the actual block device. Eg: /dev/sda1\nnone - This mean password is not specified, hence it will be prompted.\nnoauto - This will prevent auto mount during the boot time.\nSo altogether, line should be like this (assuming my encrypt device is xdisk),\n\nxdisk /dev/sda1 none noauto\n\n\nA: I'm not sure if this will work in your situation, and I've never tried this option, but you might be able to use the \"noauto\" option in /etc/fstab - more info on fstab here if you're not familiar with it.\nThe \"noauto\" option is supposed to only allow the drive to be mounted explicitly rather than automatically, useful for CD or USB drives.  You can also specify the various options that will be used when you do explicitly mount the drive, so all you need to do is a simple mount device here type command (eg, mount /dev/sdx  /mnt/somedirectory), and it can be an alias or script.  \n\nA: I'm not using LVM but I managed to get my system booting without waiting for user interaction at boot by modifying both fstab and crypttab:\nin /etc/fstab add noauto as option on disk that is encrypted. Example: /dev/mapper/Secret /mnt/Secret ext4 defaults,noatime,nodiratime,noauto 0 0\nin /etc/crypttab add options noauto and quiet.

I'm running Gnome-shell GNOME/openbox, not Unity, on a dual display. \nMy top and bottom panels are always on my laptop screen. I really want them on the external monitor when that is plugged in. I've read a ton of tips about using gconftool-2 and gconf-editor to switch the \"monitor\" key from 0 to 1 for each panel, but doing that has no effect. \nI can use alt super right to access the panel properties and move the panel to the top / left / right / bottom of my laptop screen, but I can't for the life of me move it over to my external monitor.\nI recently rearranged my desk and don't know what all I customized six months ago when I was setting up my desktop environment.

But those articles aren't satisfactory.\nI want to know it because I have Ubuntu 12.04 for Android on my chrooted HTC One X. For normal file systems like a disk or a hard drive image it seems to be clear but how works a operating system loop device? My thought is, that a simualted disk is a static thing which has no own life but an operating system has it's own life with processes and threads which are running.  \n\n\n*\n\n*Notices the kernel (here Android) that the loop device is an os image which needs a special mounting/handling? How is the native kernel in contact with the virtual os so that I can use an os within an os?\n\n*Obviously it's mounted like a file system but communicates it with the kernel via the loop back adapter or has it nothing to do with that? (just the normal network communication)\n\n\nI hope my problem isn't asked to complicated. Thanks for your help.\n\nA: Loop devices generally provides an interface to access a file as a file-system. In order to loop mount an image you have to place the image somewhere in your real file-systems, i.e. disk-partitions. \nSo while loop devices are virtual, the files they provides access to are not and those files occupy space.\nWhen you add some data to the loop-mounted file-system the data is actually added to the image file, as if you are appending/inserting some bytes of data somewhere in a file. Loop device decides where to put those bytes. So the image file grows in size and deducts space from the hosting file-system.\nTo answer the question about how OS within an OS runs, it can be said that they either share kernels or use a hypervisor to emulate an encapsulated environment which translate another OS'es instructions to hosting OS'es instructions.\n", "Q: How can I use Ubuntu to rescue files from an NTFS drive? I reinstalled windows on the laptop of my daughter. Before doing this we made a copy of her music, pictures and so on on an external drive which was formatted in NTFS. Unfortunately, the folder we created for the backup was empty (I checked after I reinstalled windows). Today a miracle happened, as suddenly the data were back but when I tried to copy them to another place they disappeared again. Checking the external drive with disk utility I got the message \"filesystem is not clean\". Is there a way to recover the data? Preferred solution would be a tool with a gui. The drive I need to repair is formatted in NTFS and is connected via usb to laptop.\n\nA: If it is a linux partition (ext4)\nGo into a LiveCD or LiveUSB, then run sudo fsck -t ext4 /dev/sda# (where sda# is the device and partition number for your drive).  If you're unsure which to run this on, please feel free to include in your question the output of sudo fdisk -l, and I can help narrow down which one to check.\nIf it is a Windows or NTFS partition\nIf the drive is \"NTFS\" and its returning unclean, you should boot into Windows and run a chkdisk on that partition.  Within Linux, if you run an fsck on NTFS, its likely to break something (NTFS is a windows format, so you should use windows chkdisk).  The NTFS fsck, while it may find the general errors, may cause problems if you need to run the NTFS drive within Windows.\n\nA: Windows specific advice:\nPLEASE READ CAREFULLY.\nIf you formatted your drive as described, during a (re-)install of Windows, then Linux is not your first priority.\nYou need an Unerase utility (for NTFS), and you need to use it before attempting to use chkdsk or any other tool. \nUbuntu forum advice:\nUbuntu (and other Linux variants) are quite capable of reading NTFS (and older) Windows-based file systems.  This is a good method of data recovery when the OS has become unusable, too slow, or infected with malware.\nHowever, this is no panacea.  If you are confronted with driver format errors or corrupted data, then a Windows-specific tools (used correctly) is you best solution.\nUPDATE::\nJust read your 'minor update'.  This is confusing, as your original description of re-installing Windows (and overwriting data) is inconsistent with this being an external drive in NTFS format.\nAre you trying to recover the backup data (from this external drive), or the drive where you re-installed Windows (overwriting the original data)?\n", "Q: Can't run FlightGear from PlayDeb on Ubuntu 12.04 32bits Trying to run FlightGear 2.6 from PlayDeb on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 32bits, I get this error every time :\n\nfgfs: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libsgtsync.so.2.6.0: undefined symbol: svn_subr_version\n\nThanks for help.\n\nA: To solve my problem :\n\n\n*\n\n*I removed the PlayDeb repository :\nsudo add-apt-repository -r \"deb http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu precise-getdeb games\".\n\n*Then, I updated the sources :\nsudo apt-get update.\n\n*Then I removed all fgfs files :\nsudo apt-get remove flightgear fgfs*.\n\n*Then I reinstalled FlightGear 2.4 :\nsudo apt-get install flightgear.\n\n*Then I added the PlayDeb repository again :\nsudo add-apt-repository \"deb http://archive.getdeb.net/ubuntu precise-getdeb games\".\n\n*And finally, I upgraded :\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n", "Q: How do I install Ubuntu on a Windows XP laptop with no boot disk?

I did an apt-cache search virtualbox to verify the name of the package before attempting the install. \nI did however, run the command suggested by Gregory above (as I was trying to get the installer to work from the iso, which it never did), but that may or may not have had an impact.\nIf you want to avoid the installing X11 dependencies use:\nsudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends virtualbox-guest-utils && sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms\n\nEdit: See comment below. \n\nA: I had the same issue. Install some additional packages and every thing will be fine:\nsudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)\n\n\nA: I would add to @ignis' solution:\nsudo reboot\nAfter the ubuntu server restarts the Guest Additions will be available to you.\n", "Q: How to change font size in Skype 4.x? I tried using \"qtconfig\" but that didn't help. (Even changing the style in Skype, then using Qtconfig won't show any effect.)  \nWhere could I make the fonts larger? (Ubuntu's accessibility settings won't affect it either.)\n\nA: You can do it through qt4-qtconfig. Install it as Eliah Kagan suggested. What he missed, though, is that you have to change the style.\nSo, when you run qtconfig, choose Gui Style to be Cleanlooks (for example), then save. Restart skype, and the new fonts will be applied. This does not work if the style is Desktop Settings.\n\nA: Install qt4-qtconfig:\nsudo apt-get install qt4-qtconfig\n\nThen run qtconfig, make changes, exit, and restart Skype.\n\nA: Open Skype, change the style -> cleanlook. Close it.\nOpen a terminal and  sudo apt-get install qt4-qtconfig .\nAfter that open Qt 4 Settings, change fint size, select cleanlook, save and exit.\nOpen skype again and voila :)\nI tested this in Linux Mint 14 Mate. It should work in Ubuntu too, though.\n\nA: You don't need to install anything. Add the following lines:\n[Qt]\nfont=\"Droid Sans,14,-1,5,50,0,0,0,0,0\"\n\nTo the .config/Trolltech.conf file, set the Clearlooks theme in Skype and restart.\n\nA: In Gnome you can do it in Control Center>>Appearence>>Fonts.\n", "Q: Maximize, minimize and close buttons are either not present or not working in Lubuntu As the title indicates, the maximize, minimize, and close buttons are either not present or not working on my Lubuntu desktop. In fact, it only seems to be Google Chrome that displays the buttons at all, and only the close button works in Chrome, maximize and minimize don't do anything. When I use regular Ubuntu, they're all there just fine but not on Lubuntu. This all seemed to occur after I hooked my netbook up to an external monitor while using Lubuntu. Not sure if that had anything to do with it or not, but it seemed too big of a coincidence to not mention. Any ideas what the cause and a fix might be?\nThanks in advance. \n\nA: From LXMenu, run the Openbox Configuration Manager. On the left side, go to Appearence, and make sure that Button Order says NLIMC.\n", "Q: How do I change local display resolution via SSH? I have a machine running Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS and I'm having problems with the local monitor. The Dell flat panel I'm using only displays this message while the computer running: \"Cannot Display This Video Mode\" and then the information: \"Optimum resolution 1280x1024 60Hz\". I'm fairly new to using an operating system wholly via command line but I'm learning fast. :) I can access the server fine via SSH so using it is not a problem. However, for where it is positioned at the moment, it would be much more convenient to use the computer locally. I'm just wondering how to change the local screen resolution via SSH to something usable by my monitor. Thanks for your time!\nBTW: I have also tried switching displays and I still have the same problem.\nAlso BTW: I tried putting in the xrandr command and all I get back is: Can't open display\n\nA: In your ssh session try running\nexport DISPLAY=:0\nprior to the xrandr call.  That will let xrandr know to use the local display rather than the one you've logged in from.\nSo, you're going to do something like:\n  $ ssh my_machine\n  ...\n  $ export DISPLAY=:0\n  $ xrandr --output VGA1 --mode 800x600\n\nReplace VGA1 with whatever the name of your display is, and 800x600 with whatever resolution you're trying to achieve.\n", "Q: Trouble communicating with router DHCP? my home network is has problems regarding linux computers, two ubuntu and two mint.

I think this is because of ubuntu, How do i change the permisions of files on ubuntu server? 12.04.\n\nA: I had the same problem. But it turns out the problem was in the /etc/vsftpd.conf file. You have to uncomment the write_enable=YES line. Or just make sure it says YES and not NO. That is what fixed it for me. \n\nA: I would need to know where the files are, but this is an example:\nuser: alex\nfolder: /home/ftp/alex\nsudo chown -R root:alex /home/ftp/alex\nsudo chmod -R 774 /home/ftp/alex\n\nThat should give you enough permissions to do what you need.\n", "Q: How do I get Disk Utility to read SMART data from USB drives? When I plug in a external USB drive and want to check its S.M.A.R.T. status in Disk Utility (palimpsest) I cannot because the option is greyed out. Is there an option somewhere to enable this feature? It works fine for internal IDE/SATA drives.\nI know the USB drive supports S.M.A.R.T. because I can use smartmontools and front end GSmartControl to get the information, but I'd rather not have to use use it since palimpsest is already installed by default.\nThanks\n\nA: You cannot. It's a known bug. They're not going to fix it anytime soon.\nSee here. The bug is confirmed, set to low importance, not assigned to any developer and has no ETA for a fix.\nI guess they're comfortable with people using smartctl/GSmartControl for SMART on USB drives...\n\nA: This is a three-year old question, but for posterity I wanted to point out that the bug was apparently fixed by 2012-10-16 in Ubuntu 12.10:\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-disk-utility/+bug/743927/comments/6\n", "Q: Gamepad setup ignored by games I recently got a wired (USB) XBox 360 gamepad. It was nearly plug-and-play on my laptop running Ubuntu 12.04. However, some control axes were mixed up. I used jstest-gtk to reconfigure the mapping and jscal-store to (supposedly) save the new configuration. However, when I run Xonotic or Nexuiz (First Person Shooters), they still uses the original mixed-up mapping. How do I make these games recognize the new configuration? BTW, I'm more concerned about Xonotic working, I really couldn't care less about Nexuiz.\nPlease no rants about why I should stick with a mouse and keyboard for gaming. [:-)\nThanks in advance.\n\nA: The problem is that jstest-gtk only changes the mapping of the joystick device, i.e. /dev/input/js0. Most modern games that use SDL however do no longer use the joystick device, but use the raw evdev instead, i.e. /dev/input/eventX and that doesn't allow any remapping.\nThe quickest workaround is setting an environment variable:\nexport SDL_JOYSTICK_DEVICE=/dev/input/js0\n\nThis will force SDL based applications to use the old joystick device and thus respect the mapping. It won't help with non-SDL applications.\nAnother alternative is xboxdrv, it's a userspace Xbox360 driver that allows a wide variety of configuration options at the driver level (including keyboard andd mouse emulation). This will work for all games.\n\nA: In Xonotic's advanced settings, there are two variables: joy_axispitch and joy_axisyaw which must be changed. Unfortunately, Xonotic resets them to default when you close the game. What I did to fix this was in the directory /home/username/.xonotic/data I added a file which I called \"config-mods.cfg\". In this file are two lines:\n\"joy_axispitch\" \"4\"\n\"joy_axisyaw\" \"3\"\nFinally I made a simple shell script with these two lines of code:\ncat /home/username/.xonotic/data/config-mods.cfg >> /home/username/.xonotic/data/config.cfg\n/home/username/Applications/Xonotic/xonotic-linux64-sdl -basedir  /home/username/Applications/Xonotic/`\n\nI run this script instead of running the game directly, and it adds the two lines I need for joystick support.\n", "Q: Help on app directories?

I am currently running Ubuntu as a guest vm on a Win 7 host via VirtualBox, but I would like to have a portable version of Ubuntu when I am not using my laptop. \nI am unsure as to the difference between the following:\n1)LiveCD with persistence;\n2)LiveCD without persistence;\n3)LiveUSB with persistence;\n4)LiveUSB without persistence;\n5)Full-install. \nI have a USB flash drive (32GB), and I also have empty DVDs lying around. I know that persistence means that data can be saved, but I am unsure as to which option to choose. What is the difference between a LiveUSB and a full-install on a USB thumbdrive and why would I want to pick one over the other? Thanks for any help. \n\nA: Live with persistence:\nYou have the portability of live media with a home-folder and possibly other temp storage\nLive without:\nPortability but no saved anything\nLiveUSB with persistence:\nLess life out of the USB(a bunch more reads), but very similar to 1\nLiveUSB without persistence:\nLess life out of the USB(a bunch more reads), but very similar to 2\nFull install:\nObviously, a full install to the USB would translate to shorter life since it would drastically increase the number of reads and writes.\n\nA: Advantages of a persistent install:\n1) You can use the persistent pendrive to install Ubuntu to another computer.\n2) A persistent install takes up less space on the pendrive.\n3) You can reset the pendrive by overwriting the old casper-rw file with a new one.\n4) The install to pendrive takes less time.\nAdvantages of a Full install:\n1) You can update and upgrade.\n2) If you have problems or wish to modify, the solution is the same as with an internal install, (You can ask for help in these forums).\n3) No ugly startup / install screen.\n4) Better security, you can encrypt home folder.\n5) You can use proprietary drivers.\n6) Hibernation works.\n7) A persistent install is limited to a 4GB casper-rw and a 4GB home-rw persistence file, to get more persistence requires persistence partitions. \n8) Faster boot.\nNote that once booted, both methods run at about the same speed.\n", "Q: Part-time Kid-PC: is Wubi better, or Ubuntu in a virtual machine? I have a new Win7 box and wanted to try out Ubuntu (total noob, no experience in linux). Which option will have the better performance (side by side, or in a vm). I'm guessing sidebyside, but figured I'd ask anyways.\nMy original intent was to create a quick/dirty way for kids to go online and not kill my pc with crap. \nThanks\nNewb Nooberson III\n\nA: \nDisclaimer: I don't have kids, and pet dogs and cats have been known walk across my keyboards trying to trigger a Ctrl-Alt-Del (REIS... for the Linux folks), but anyway, here goes! :)\n\nDefinitely virtual machine, assuming you can set it so they can't \"escape\" to the host.\nTake known-good snapshots, revert whenever something goes (or is made to go ;) wrong.\nWubi may be dangerous kid-wise because it will mount your NTFS (Windows 7) partitions r-w by default...\n\nA: From my experience with my own kids I can tell that they are most likely not happy with the performance a virtual machine offers (kids rarely read Wikipedia when they go online).\nAs long as they only play online games or games natively supported by Ubuntu (see the Software Center and also the Humble Bundle games for that) they will be more than happy with a Ubuntu only box. This can very easily be administrated and restored with (frequent!) backups in case they break things (mine did not so far).\nI would recommend to do that in a dual-boot setup where you can deny Windows access by simply not giving them a Windows user/password.\nThe time will come when they desperately need to play a Windows game. This will most likely not perform well in a virtual machine. Then you will need to secure your Windows installation before you grant them access. For Windows there are many parental control and sandbox solutions available that may help you.\n\nA: There's pros and cons to either option. I don't actually suggest either... but we'll come to that.\nWubi is darned near a real install, with actual hardware access, but as its a image file inside a real filesystem , it can occationally get corrupted.\nVMs are reliable and do snapshots, but there's nothing stopping your kids from switching over to windows, and you don't have access to things like the graphics card.\nI'd suggest a USB install - of which there's two types - unetbootin will give you a platform agnostic liveusb, with a persistant portion for changes. A full install of ubuntu can also be done to a suitably set up liveusb. Both options give you a reasonably fast install of ubuntu that can be set up to leave the main hard drive alone\nThere's some things i'd do with any install - Don't give the kids the admin user password (that is to say the password you use with sudo), so they can't install or break anything. Give them an individual account per kid (and since they are limited accounts, you can set it that they can't break anything), or better yet, a personal thumbdrive with the environment set up for them. Periodically image the whole USB drive  ( I use usb image writer on windows quite a bit. dd would do the trick in linux) or at copy the persistant parts of the install. \nI'd note personally, while i recommend limited accounts (on any os!) any kid who breaks into the admin account has earned it ;p.\n", "Q: can not authenticate libopenexr6 in update manager I got this message when I was using update manager\nThe action would require the installation of packages from not authenticated sources- details-libopenexr6\n\nPlease help , how can I authenticate libopenexr6 ? \n\nA: Open your terminal and type this:\nsudo -i\napt-get update\napt-get -y upgrade\napt-get -y dist-upgrade\n\nto get updates .\nRegarding to your issue, open your update manager and select settings option.

I'm running 12.04 Precise.  When I first log into my computer, the touchpad behaves exactly as expected and desired.  The longer I stay logged in, it slowly degrades.  I'll try describe it.\nThere are 3 ways of \"dragging\" on this clickpad:\n\n\n*\n\n*(Physical) click and hold with one finger, and drag around while still holding it down.  All with one finger.\n\n*(Physical) Click and hold with one finger, then with another finger drag around to move cursor.\n\n*Double tap (not a physical click) and on the second tap, hold and drag.  \n\n\nI most naturally use option 1, but here's how it works:\n\n\n*\n\n*When I first turn on, options 1, 2 and 3 all work.\n\n*After a while, only options 2 and 3 work.\n\n*Later still, only option 3 works.\n\n*Restarting X causes all 3 to work again.\n\n\nI've compared the output of \"synclient\" in each of the states, and there was no difference.  Anybody know what to look at?\nOr at the very least, a command I can run to \"restart\" the mouse driver without restarting X?\n\nA: From the terminal (Ctrl+Alt+t), run the following command:\nsudo modprobe -r psmouse && sudo modprobe psmouse proto=imps\nSynaptic touchpad on laptop not working\n\nA: Answering my own question in case anyone has the same problem.\nThe solution mentioned in the comment by Marky did get the touchpad to drag/drop again, but it prevented any multi-touch from working, so 2 Finger Scroll, 2 Finger Right Click etc stopped working.  While using Unity 2D I kept restarting Xorg (log out, log back in) whenever I had issues with the mouse.  \nThe fix in the end was unexpected: upgrading to Unity 3D.  I have not had the problem since switching.  I assume something in Unity 2D's suspend/resume calls is breaking the touchpad functionality.\n", "Q: How do I triple-boot Ubuntu, Fedora and Windows 7? I have an Acer Laptop with windows 7 pre installed. I want to install Ubuntu and fedora and make a triple boot configuration. I want to know how? I am a newcomer to linux and I need help.\n\nA: Make a backup of your windows 7 install - Imaging the whole disk with clonezilla is a good idea since OEM installs often do wierd bootloader stuff. This also means you can restore the system to factory settings if needed.\nFirstly if you have lots of ram, avoid a swap partition ... We'll come to why later.\nPlan your partitions - I'd suggest going with 2 system partitions, and initially one or no swap partition - this should simplify things considerably, and there's a good reason for this. I'd also suggest setting slightly different partition sizes for each (For example, 50 gigs for windows, 30 gigs for ubuntu, 28 gigs for fedora, and 2 gigs for swap). Write down the sizes. Make sure you know them. I'd suggest leaving the windows partition as primary, and using extended and logical partitions for linux. \nResize the windows partition, making sure its the first partition - i'd use the tools in the first linux distro you install to resize. Install, reboot, and check both OSes work. Ideally, i'd make a second image of the drive at this point\nInstall the second distribution. Reboot and retest.\nAt this point you have two OSes and ONE swap partition. Sharing a swap partition is messy - so i'd suggest setting up a swap file. There's no real performance issues with modern partitions.\nFor each distro, you will need to do the following things as root (su for fedora, sudo su for ubuntu will work). Instructions adapted from cyberciti\nFirstly, you will want to create a disk image for your swap file - for a 512 mb swap file \ndd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile1 bs=1024 count=524288 - replace the value of 'count' with the size you want in bytes.\nmkswap /swapfile1 format the swapfile as a swap partiton\nchown root:root /swapfile1 Give ownership of the swap file to root\nchmod 0600 /swapfile1 Give read-write permissions to the file to root only.\nswapon /swapfile1 activate swap file\nNow, you will need to edit fstab to load up the swapfile for the system on boot\nto do this\n nano /etc/fstab opens up the fstab file in nano (you can do this with the text editor of preference)\nAdd the line /swapfile1 swap swap defaults 0 0 to it, and remove any other lines referring to swap.\nIf the other linux boot has no swap file, repeat - you can rename the swap file if you choose.\nThis should give you a neat triple boot, with as simple a partition layout as possible.\n\nA: I suggest you install Windows first, then Fedora, then install Ubuntu last. Installing Windows first will ensure that Fedora's or Ubuntu's GRUB will detect Windows and allow you to choose between all three operating systems.\n\n\n*\n\n*Install Windows! (Skip this step if you have it already)\n\n*Shrink your Windows Partition using Disk Management by clicking the Start Menu, then right-click Computer, then select Manage.  Then Select Disk Management from the sidebar.\n\n\n*Right-Click the Windows Partition and Choose \"Shrink Volume\".  Decide How many MB's you will want to give to Ubuntu and Fedora.  More is better. Remember: 1GB = 1024MB.  I suggest shrinking about 20-50 GBs for both Fedora and Ubuntu, since they need at least 6.5 GB for both.\n\n*Shut down Windows.\n\n*Boot into a Fedora Installation or Live CD and choose \"Install Fedora\".\n\n*Keep going and then stop at this step.\n\n\n*Choose Create Custom Layout.\n\n\n*Select the \"Free\" thing and then click the \"Create\" button.\n\n\n*Click Create again.  Choose the Mount Point as / and give some space to Fedora in MBs.  Remember to leave some space for Ubuntu!\n\n\n*Go through the rest of the Process.(next, next, next.)\n\n\n*Restart your machine and setup Fedora.\nFedora is now installed! Have fun with Fedora.\n\n\n*Then reboot into a Ubuntu Live CD.\n\n\n*Again, stop at this step.\n\n\n*Choose Something Else.\n\n\n*Click the Free space and then click Add.  Again choose / for the mount point and use a Logical Partition.  Choose any Disk size you want.\n\n\n*Click OK and go through the rest of the process. (next,next,next.)\n\n\n*A GRUB menu should appear to let you choose Windows, Ubuntu, and Fedora!\nNote: If Fedora didn't show up in the GRUB menu, you might have to type sudo update-grub in the Terminal.\nSharing swap on a USB flash drive between Ubuntu and Fedora\nHere is how to share swap on a USB flash drive between Ubuntu and Fedora.  (Thanks Akshit Baunthiyal!)\nFor anyone that doesn't know what Swap is, read the SwapFaq in the Official Ubuntu Documentation.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot into Ubuntu.\n\n*Insert a 4GB+ USB Stick.  Use a spare one, because stuff on the USB will be gone soon!  Of course, you can ignore these steps, so read the SwapFaq to decide if you really need swap.\n\n*Then go to Disk Utility.  The USB Stick should show up in the sidebar.\n\nBecause I don't have a spare USB lying around the USB stick that is supposed to show up isn't shown.\n\n\n*Click on the USB Stick, and then select Format Drive.  Then choose linuxswap as the format.  Remember not to format the wrong drive!!!\n\n*After formatting, scroll to the side and look at the Device: column.  Note the string that is followed by that.  It should be something like \"/dev/sdx1\".  Remember that!\n\n\n*Fire up a terminal by searching \"Terminal\" in the dash.\n\n*Type sudo mkswap /dev/sdx1 in the Terminal.  Enter your password when prompted and replace \"/dev/sdx1\" with the string that I told you to remember.\n\n*Next, type sudo swapon /dev/sdb.  Again, replace /dev/sdb with the string.\n\n*Then, type sudo gedit /etc/fstab.  A window will appear.\n\n\n*Add /dev/sdx1 swap swap defaults 0 0 to the end of the file.\n\n*Save the file and close it.\nApply the same thing with Fedora if you want, but just remember that there is no sudo in Fedora and you will have to switch to a root prompt:\nsu --login\n\nthen type in your password in Fedora and follow the steps without having to type \"sudo\".\nNow you should have a triple-Boot system with Ubuntu, Windows, Fedora, and a swap in Both Ubuntu and Fedora!\n", "Q: Input/Output Error Copying Files from Internal Harddrive to External Drive.

I messed up some core packages in my Python distribution, probably through some failed easy_install commands.  Is there any way in Ubuntu to blow away the site's Python installation and re-install it to the form defined in the Ubuntu package manager?\nI am running Ubuntu 10.04.\n\nA: For future reference I recommend installing virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper to stop anything like this happening again. Virtaulenv lets you keep separate, distinct python installations for each of your projects and Virtualenvwrapper makes it easy to work with them. Then any mess ups you cause are limited to one project.\nFor your current problem, anything you installed using pip can be removed with pip's uninstall command. The following shell script from pastebin (I haven't tested it, just to give you warning, and do not accept any responsibility for any loss or damage it might cause , though I can't see anything harmful in it) should remove all pip packages simultaneously:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#if [ \"$#\" -ne 1 ]; then\n#    echo \"Usage: $0 <py pkg name using \\$(pip freeze -l)>\"\n#    exit\n#fi\n\nfor plugin in $(pip freeze -l); do\n    PLUGIN=$(echo \"$plugin\" | awk -F == '{print $1}')\n    echo \"Uninstalling $PLUGIN...\"\n    expect -c \"spawn pip uninstall $PLUGIN\n    expect {\n        \\\"Proceed (y/n)?\\\" {\n            send \\\"y\\r\\n\\\"\n            expect {\n                exit\n                }\n        }\n    }\"    \ndone\n\nRegrettably I don't think there is an easy way to remove packages installed with easy-install because it doesn't keep track of what you installed, which is partly why pip was developed.\n\nA: The stuff you installed with easy_install should have all ended up in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/. So you can just delete everything in there. Nothing was installed from a package will be in there, so it's safe to delete.\n", "Q: no wired or wireless networking on new install This is a new install of Ubuntu.

After that, everything got screwed.\nNow, I normally run the CRT at 1152x854 and the LCD at 1280x1024 with the CRT as my primary monitor (with panel) and the LCD without panels etc just to display other windows when I want to drag them over there.\nThe problem is now that if I set my CRT to 1152x864, it stays at 1280x1024 virtually and half the stuff falls off the screen.\nIt also puts the LCD at 1280x1024 BUT then overlays the CRT's display ontop with different wallpaper in an L shape down the right-hand and bottom edges.\nIn short, nothing makes sense and everything is FUBAR.\nI tried uninstalling fglrx through synaptic, and renaming xorg.conf and also the xfce XML file that has monitor settings but it still won't make sense.\nUnity on the other hand can currently set everything normally so the problem appears to be only with XFCE.\nIn any case, I can't even get the fglrx drivers back, when I re-installed them, I can't run amdccle anymore as it says the driver isn't installed!!\nCan someone help me reset my XFCE settings so the monitors aren't screwed with some incorrect virtual desktop size and also so I can get fglrx drivers back and working?

In my opinion, the most simple are three:\n\n\n*\n\n*uninstall some unused programs to free some space;\n\n*repartition your hard disk in order to make sda7 bigger;\n\n*reinstall Ubuntu, but this time creating a unique partition for everything.\n\n\nIf you want to go with the way 2 and need support, please provide the output full of sudo fdisk -l /dev/sda If none of those solution fit for your needs, give us some feedback and we may find something else with your help.\nWhatever you'll choose, I must suggest you to backup your stuff before proceeding.\n\nTo repartition your hard disk: again, there are many options. I suggest you to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Create a Live CD with Ubuntu and boot with it, choose \"Try Ubuntu\" when asked and open GParted Partition Editor.\n\n*From there, you need to make sda8 smaller and move it to the right. To do so, right-click on /dev/sda8 and select Resize/Move (you may need to Unmount first). Set Free space preceding to 10240 MiB (10 GiB).\n\n*Then you need to make sda7 bigger: right-click it, choose Resize/Move and set both Free space preceding and following to 0.\n\n*Apply the operations (it may take several minutes) and close GParted.\n\n*Now you should have made your root partition big enough to hold your own files. You need to move them. From a terminal:\n$ sudo -s\n# cd /media/\n# mkdir sda7 sda8\n# mount /dev/sda7 sda7/\n# mount -r /dev/sda8 sda8/\n# cp -ar sda8/* sda7/home/\n\ncp may take several minutes before completing.\n\n*Now issue sudo gedit /media/sda7/etc/fstab. You should see a line similar to this one:\n UUID=01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef /home ext4 errors=remount-ro 0 0\n\nSome values may change, what's important is that you should see /home preceded and followed by one or more blank spaces. Once you have found the line, remove it.\n\n*Almost finished! What you need to do is to remove the old home partition and make use of the freed space. So, open GParted again, unmount sda7 and sda8, delete sda8 (right-click and Delete), make sda7 bigger (right-click, Resize/Move, set 0 to both Free space following and preceding). Finally, apply the operations and close GParted.\nNow you are done. Reboot and from your own Ubuntu run df -h again. You will see that the available space for the root directory / has increased. You will also see that /home does not appear in the output.\nNote: as you may have already noticed, repartitioning your disk is not a five-minutes task. Such operations are always risky: if you click the wrong button or if your computer experiences a power failure during the process, you will lose all of your data. Remember to backup before doing anything!\n\nA: You may run out of free inodes. Try \ndf -i\n\nSay, you may have space left, but not inode to \"index\" content.\n", "Q: Can I stop battery charging at say 80% and switch to AC?

I'm attempting to connect the the Ubuntu One DBus service and obtain login credentials for my app, however the slots I've connected to the DBus return signals detailed here never seem to be firing, despite a positive result being returned during the connection. \nBefore I start looking for errors in the details relating to this specific service, could someone please tell me if this code would even work in the first place, or if I'm done something wrong here?\nint main()\n{\n    UbuntuOneDBus *u1Dbus = new UbuntuOneDBus;\n    u1Dbus->init()\n}\n\nclass UbuntuOneDBus : public QObject\n{\n  Q_OBJECT\n\n  QString busName;\n  QString path;\n  QString interface;\n  QString method;\n  QString signature;\n\n  void connectReturnSignals();\n\nprivate slots:\n  void credentialsFound();\n  void credentialsNotFound();\n  void credentialsError();\n\npublic:\n  UbuntuOneDBus();\n\n  void init();\n};\n\nUbuntuOneDBus::UbuntuOneDBus()\n{\n  busName = \"com.ubuntuone.Credentials\";\n  path = \"/credentials\";\n  interface = \"com.ubuntuone.CredentialsManagement\";\n  method = \"register\";\n  signature = \"a{ss}\";\n\n  connectReturnSignals();\n}\n\nvoid UbuntuOneDBus::init()\n{\n  QDBusMessage message = QDBusMessage::createMethodCall( busName, path, interface, method );\n  QDBusConnection::sessionBus().send( message );\n}\n\nvoid UbuntuOneDBus::connectReturnSignals()\n{\n  QDBusConnection::sessionBus().connect( busName, path, interface, \"CredentialsFound\", this, SLOT( credentialsFound() ) );\n  QDBusConnection::sessionBus().connect( busName, path, interface, \"CredentialsNotFound\", this, SLOT( credentialsNotFound() ) );\n  QDBusConnection::sessionBus().connect( busName, path, interface, \"CredentialsError\", this, SLOT( credentialsError() ) );\n}\n\nvoid UbuntuOneDBus::credentialsFound()\n{\n  qDebug() << \"Credentials found\";\n}\n\nvoid UbuntuOneDBus::credentialsNotFound()\n{\n  std::cout << \"Credentials not found\" << std::endl;\n}\n\nvoid UbuntuOneDBus::credentialsError()\n{\n  std::cout << \"Credentials error\" << std::endl;\n}\n\n\nA: The signature argument to the connect method looks wrong.\nFunny as it looks, it should be just \"a{ss}\".\nThat already means \"array of dictionary items with string as key and string as value\", so the added part \"(Dict of {String, String})\" may happen to be interpreted the wrong way. Similarly, the signature for the CredentialsNotFound D-Bus signal should not be \"(nothing)\", it should be just an empty string like \"\".\nTo familiarize yourself with the other data types that D-Bus offers try a tutorial like this:\nhttp://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-python/doc/tutorial.html#data-types\n\nA: I'm not entirely sure how slots work in Qt exactly, but my understanding is you still need to define the function to have the correct signature to match the signature of the DBus signals. So in the case of Credentials Found, it needs to take a hash/map of string keys and values, assuming that QtDBus converts the \"a{ss}\" signature into the correct data type automatically. I suspect such slot functions also need to accept any standard arguments provided by QtDBus itself.\nI also found this quick tutorial from Nokia, which might be helpful: http://www.developer.nokia.com/Community/Wiki/QtDbus_quick_tutorial\n", "Q: Can Ubuntu use a flash drive to increase performance like ReadyBoost? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs there any way that an external hard drive can be used to boost performance? \n\nThis might be a silly question but is there any way to use a flash drive to optimize the memory on lubuntu 12.04? Kinda like how you can in win7?\n\nA: To answer your question, No.  ReadyBoost is a disk cache component of Windows, works by using flash memory, a USB flash drive, as cache, NOT as swap.  Plus too much I/O operations in a flash drive can damage it in a long run. \nNowadays RAM is cheap, so you'd better off using RAM, since USB is slower than RAM.  Or you can use SSD.\n", "Q: How can I set Beatbox as default music player? I have installed Beatbox but I can't set it as default music player in System Configuration of Gnome-shell.

I'd like to remove some unwanted languages from my system.\nI only use Italian, and English UK and US.\nIn \"Systems Settings\" I can find a lot of languages that I don't even know why they have been installed. However, although I am an administrator, I can't remove the unwanted languages (as you can see the \"-\" is greyed out).\nI have tried running \"sudo gnome-control-center\" but there the only language displayed is English.\nThanks a lot in advance for the help!\nLuca\n\n\nA: Languages with localized variants are provided in a package:\n- English contains AU, US, UK, NZ, SA, etc. variants\n- Chinese contains variants, etc.\nYou can't remove specific variants without removing the whole package (from the desktop).\nIf you are adventurous, you can try removing those locales via the command-line, e.g. en_NZ.UTF_8, etc.\n", "Q: How Can I Install LibreOffice Base?

There are deb tgz packages (x86_64 or x86).

I have found 2 solutions to the Java issue (Could anyone provide a step by step for getting juniper netconnect and citrix? and  Running 32-bit Firefox with sun-jre in 64-bit Ubuntu) but now I am struggling with a new issue.\nNetwork Connect makes changes directly to the /etc/resolv.conf file. This causes issues with the newer way that Ubuntu does DNS resolutions which is to point DNS to the local resolver/cacher: dnsmasq. Once NC disconnects and you change networks, e.g. go from office to home, then DNS stops working correctly. \nWhat happens is that NC deletes the /etc/resolv.conf file which is actually symlinked to /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf. What's worse is that NC actually deletes the original file not the link. So when you try to restore the file with:\nsudo ln -s /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf\n\nIt fails as /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf is now gone. Re-installing resolvconf does not fix it and neither does running resolvconf. \nSo the best way I have found so far is to first backup /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf to another location. After you disconnect NC I then run a script that removes /etc/resolv.conf, replaces the deleted  /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf and then links it back to /etc again.\nDoes anyone know a way to avoid this or do I pretty much have he best \"fix\" in place already? Any way to prevent NC from breaking it in the first place?\n\nA: First: clicking the Sign Out button in the Network Connect window (the window that shows the VPN IP while connected) and \nThen clicking on the Sign Out button in the logged-in web page avoids this problem. \nPlease indicate in comment if this works or not.\nThanks\n\nA: The best way to fix the /etc/resolv.conf symlink is to run\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf\n\nand answer YES to prepare resolv.conf for dynamic updates.\n\nA: I would expect that you do not need to reinstall the package. Just restarting resolvconf should fix the problem:\nsudo service resolvconf restart\n\nIf that does not happen to work, in addition you can try restarting the network service which will try to write a new set of values to /etc/resolv.conf\nsudo service network restart\n\n\nA: After Network Connect has been stopped it suffices to do the following.\nsudo ln -s ../run/resolvconf/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf\nsudo resolvconf -u  # Regenerate /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf\n\nYou don't need to back up /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf beforehand.\n", "Q: How green are Ubuntu and Canonical? im a student of Environmental Engineering, currently searching for a Bachelor Thesis Theme.\nI am curious, if there any internal information about Ubuntu related to CO2/Energy saving compared to other Operating Systems.\nand what Canonical does for the Environment/sustainability in the offices, during the work etc, in general.\nThank you so much!\nGreeting from Lisbon\n\nA: This seems like a question you should ask someone officially at Canonical.\nIt would definitely look better if you need to list your sources for the bachelor thesis to have official corporate data rather than some answers you got on a forum, right?\nHere's a link to the Canonical contact page.

Rebuilding the package is a rather advanced topic, I don't know how experienced you are.\nAnother approach would be to wait a couple of months if you can. The quantal-proposed branch appears to me to have that patch. I'm referring to this code on Launchpad. This is currently being tested and if testing is OK will probably be incorporated into the Quantal 12.10 release in October.\n", "Q: Maximizing a window taking a long time on 12.04 On my Ubuntu 12.04 maximizing a window - for example terminal - is taking a long time (5+ seconds).

Now there are no more wobbly windows and it takes a while to maximize a window.\nThanks\n\nA: I also had the same problem when using 12.04 with my Nvidia Quadro NVS 295. Installing the \"post-release\" driver didn't work for me.\nHowever disabling window animations in Compiz Settings Manager seemed to fix the problem *(although you miss out on some pretty effects).\nI installed Compiz Settings Manager:\nsudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager\n\nThen ran it from Unity dash and de-selected \"Animations\" under the \"Effects\" section.\n\nA: On my NVidia Quadro NVS 140M, i experienced the same behavior with the regular proprietary drivers.

I have two laptops running Ubuntu 12.04. Both connect to the same WIFI network to access internet.\nHow do I connect them to each other so that I can access files on one from another and vice versa?\nAlso, how do I manage the user permissions, etc. on them?\n\nA: A Quick Way to Share Folders in Ubuntu\n\nObjectives:\nShare a folder between 2 Ubuntu using samba PC's\n\n\n\n\n\nsudo smbpasswd -a USERNAME\n\n\nA: Share files between 2 Ubuntu computers\nIf you have two computers running Ubuntu on the same network, it would be an good idea to use openssh to share files between them.\nOn the server (the computer with the files you want to access), run:\nsudo apt install openssh-server\n\nOn the client you should have ssh installed already (if for some reason it's not install, run sudo apt install openssh-client).\nThen you need to figure out the IP of the computer you want to connect to. Most of the time it's something like 192.168.1.x. To find out the IP, run ifconfig and look for the \"wl...\" interface (or \"eth...\" if you're connected over Ethernet cable).\nOn the client, open Nautilus (Super+E) and go to “File -> Connect to Server”.\nEnter sftp://<the_IP_of_the_server>\n\nOn older version of Ubuntu, you could pick the folder you wish to share. As of Ubuntu 16, if you don't specify a path after the IP, you'll get the home directory. For a specific directory outside of the home dir of the user you're connecting as, you need to type its path.\nNote that it could take some time to connect, depending on the size of the folder directory.\nYou'll be prompted for the user/password of the computer you want to connect to.\nThe name of the directory will become a bookmark in Nautilus.\nYou should have read/write permissions.\n\nA: It seems like every installation of samba is a bit different. You'll want to tweak around with the settings until you get something that works.\nPerhaps this will help though. This is my mount of an ntfs drive:\n[Alpha]\n    path = /media/alpha/\n    browseable = yes \n    readonly = no\n    guest ok = yes \n    create mask = 0644\n    directory mask = 0755\n    force user = default\n    force group = default\n\nThen I made sure that /media/alpha was mounted with 777 permissions.\nUsing Samba does this to you... sshfs is better.\nEdit: I've recently updated the permissions on my External Drive, and having it mounted as 777 isn't required. Limiting permissions on an ntfs drive is probably another topic.\n\nA: You can achive this securely via SSH, you need to install openssh-server on the host machine from which you want to access the files use following command to install:\nsudo apt install openssh-server\n\nGet your local ip address of system which has files you want to access\nip address show\n\n\nif connected to wifi pick 3: wl01 or in case of Ethernet pick 2: enp3s0\nyou are done with host, move to the system form which you want to access, open file manager (nautilus) and chose Other Locations at the bottom notice connect to Server input box \n\nEnter\nsftp://<the_IP_of_the_server>/home/<username>\n\nand press connect, you will be asked username and password of the user of which files you want to access\n\nA: If you do not require encryption you can use python. If you have installed python you can try SimpleHTTPServer. For this\ncd /folder/to/share\n\nAnd then,\npython -m SimpleHTTPServer\n\nThis will allow sharing through port 8000. The other machine can access the files using http://yourlocalIP:8000\nEDIT\nSince python2 is stopped support, here is the command to python3\npython3 -m http.server\n\n\nA: go to /etc/samba directory and type: \n   sudo gedit smb.conf\n\nThen just add this line after workgroup name:\n   usershare owner only = false\n\nand exit with saving.\nNow restart the services:\n   sudo service smbd restart\n\n   sudo service nmbd restart\n\nNow create a samba user:\n   sudo smbpasswd -a RAIHAN\n\nand provide password for that user.\nThat's it!!!\n", "Q: PyGtk: Scrolllist with Entry, can I set an Id I have a scroll list on my window that I am going to insert 2 entry for each row, I am trying to understand how I can catch the entry that has been changed and update my array with this value.\nI will explain what is my code:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have an array that has 2 fields: Name and Description \n\n*Each row has 2 entry, Name and Description\n\n\nWhen I am going to modify the row number 2 I want to update my object on my array:\nrows[1].name = XXX\nrows[1].description = YYY\n\nA: I found a solution.

I am trying to install Ubuntu on a Netcom NC-499 board that contains a Vortex86DX processor. The processor vendor claims support for Ubuntu 10.04 but I am having problems installing it. I am trying to install to a 8GB compact flash card attached to the board with an IDE connector, using a USB connection CD-Rom drive and a burned ISO image obtained from this link http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/10.04.0/ubuntu-10.04.3-desktop-i386.iso . Installation proceeds up to the point of around 78% but during the stage where the installer informs me that it is \"configuring apt\", the installer terminates with a popup dialog containing the following \n  \"The installer encountered an unrecoverable error. A desktop session will \n    now be run so that you may investigate the problem or try installing again.\"\n\nI have no idea what to do at this point. I am a Linux novice and I do not really know how to investigate the problems with the installation.

I am able to install Ubuntu 8.04 using exactly the same procedure successfully so I am sure there is no problem with my CD-Rom compatibility or the compact flash drive. Any help will be gratefully received.\n\nA: Well, the solution is to use the special 2.6.34 kernel DMP supplies here, which is required to install Ubuntu 10.04.\nI don't know if your \"vendor\" is the manufacturer (DMP Taiwan), or a retailer/distributor, but DMP makes this fact perfectly clear on their support page:\n\nIn any case, you should start with the latest Ubuntu 10.04.4 Alternate Install CD, available from this page.

So I'll can write an if statement for it.\n\nA: You can type in terminal:\ngsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme\n\nOr in Python:\nfrom gi.repository import Gio\ntheme=Gio.Settings.new('org.gnome.desktop.interface').get_string('gtk-theme')\n\n\nA: If you choose a stock icon, it will always use the icon of the theme which was chosen by the user.\nAlso: Why do the GNOME symbolic icons appear darker in a running application?\n", "Q: Execute file with default program from zsh?

I think my question is pretty clear. What I want to achieve in conky is auto-hide feature.\nThe reason for this:\nLet's suppose I am browsing and suddenly I want to see my battery status or eth0 downspeed or RAM Usage. Currently what I do is press Win + D to show desktop and than see my conky.\nIs it possible that I can hover my mouse to the top of my screen(conky align = tm) and it displays the conky setup.\nIf it is not possible than is there any other way I can access conky quickly.\n\nA: The easiest way I can think of doing this is to cause the action of moving the mouse to the top to show/hide the desktop. Assuming you're using unity, you can do this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Ubuntu Software Center. Search for \"CompizConfig Settings Manager\". Install it.\n\n*Open CompizConfig Settings Manager and click \"General Options\".\n\n*Go to the tab at the top labeled \"Key Bindings\".\n\n*Scroll down until you see a screen with the words \"Show Desktop\" next to it. It should have a button that says \"None\" across from it.\n\n*Click that button. A window with a screen in it will pop up. Click the red bar running across that screen. Click OK.\n\n*If it gives you a pop-up about any other plugin using the top of the screen, click \"Set Show Desktop Anyway\".\n\n\nYou should now be able to show/hide the desktop by moving the mouse to the top of the screen.\nHope this solves your problem!\n", "Q: How to connect my CDMA modem?

I just found out about and started looking into the Ubuntu App Contest, and I wanted to double check the contest's stance on using open source libraries built by others that are freely available on the web. \nI read through the rules and some of the other Q&As, and it sounds like using these libraries would not be allowed (since it could mean the app isn't built from scratch, and the library would not be in the Ubuntu archive - although I could bundle the library with the app), and I just wanted to verify this assumption.\n\nA: You are free to use any libraries you choose as long as they are available to the user using the normal Ubuntu app installation method. This means that the library needs to be in the archives already, or included with your application.  As long as you can do one of these, the application is admissible for the App Showdown contest.  Be aware that your entry will be judged only on the code you wrote and the value it adds on top of the libraries you are using.\n", "Q: Can I submit an application started one year ago to the Ubuntu App Showdown?

If so, how? I want to know how to install Microsoft Office (specifically, Microsoft Office 2010) in Ubuntu? \nI am a die hard fan of MS Office and I want to know if there is a way I can use it in Ubuntu.\n\nA: I tried to install Office 2010 on my Ubuntu system. It crashed half way through. However, Office 2007 works without issues on the same settings. I suggest you try out Office 2007 . There is virtually no difference between the two. \nMind you, MS Outlook and MS Access dont run on wine at all (atleast for me they fail to launch every time) . Only Word, Powerpoint , Excel and Publisher and Visio will work. \nUPDATE:\nI have managed to install office 2010 using playonlinux 4.0.16 on Ubuntu 12.04 Beta 1 64bit. Find the tutorial here\nIts as easy as installing it on Windows. \nSee the screenshot below\n\n\nA: A fallback option is to run an actual version of Windows under a virtualization system like virtualbox or KVM.  Of these, VirtualBox is the easiest to get running and to learn: just install the package virtualbox-ose with aptitude, Synaptic, etc.  It's a fairly standard GUI application.  Consult the online manual and/or other documentation for further info.\n\nA: install playonlinux, fire up playonlinux and chose \"other download software\" on the left hand side, and select Office 2010 on the right hand side scroll list. After that it is pretty clear on how to install office 2010.  The install process takes a while so be patient. \n\nA: You can install Playonlinux. PlayOnLinux is a graphical front-end for the Wine software compatibility layer which aims to simplify the installation of Windows-based application. \nIf you have the CD, you can follow the instructions there. If you don't you can buy the CD here, you should also be able to buy the CD in the computer store nearest you.\n\nThese components don't work :  \n\n\n*\n\n*Microsoft Office Access  \n\n*Microsoft Office Groove  \n\n*Microsoft Office Outlook\n\n\nA: I am currently using Microsoft Office 2010 Professional and it works great, didnt have ANY problems installing or starting it up. Get this, it actually runs faster in linux than it did when i used to have windows on this box... i almost laughted my head right off.\nI'm using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and KDE 9.10.0, 32-bit (i386) all around. My Wine version is 1.5\nI use the kubuntu backports for kde and the backports for wine as well just to keep updated. \n\nA: Try PlayOnLinux.\nNote that the first few images are from myself, and the rest are from here since I don't have a MS Office 2010 CD.\nThe following tutorial also works in Ubuntu 12.10.\nDownload PlayOnLinux using the commands:\nwget -q \"http://deb.playonlinux.com/public.gpg\" -O- | sudo apt-key add -\nsudo wget http://deb.playonlinux.com/playonlinux_precise.list -O     \n/etc/apt/sources.list.d/playonlinux.list\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install playonlinux\n\n\nClick Install.\n\nSearch for the Microsoft Office version you want to install (in our case, it's MS Office 2010).\n\nClick Install.\n\nClick Next.\n\nChoose Other. I'll assume that you have your MS Office 2010 CD.\n\nInsert your CD and type /media/cdrom in the blank space. Replace cdrom with the name of the CD. Then click next and MS Office 2010 will be installed!\nAlthough you can install MS Office, I recommend using LibreOffice (which is installed by default).

At any rate, I needed 32 bit Wine.\nYou also need a 32-bit Office 2010 ISO file.\nSTEP 1)\ninstall WINE, WINETRICKS from Ubuntu software center\nWhen I did this, I wound up with versions:\n\nwine1.6 1:1.6.2-0ubuntu4 \nwinetricks 0.0+20140302-0ubuntu2\n\nSTEP 2) \nCreate a wine prefix\n\nWINEARCH=win32 WINEPREFIX=~/wine32 winecfg \n\nNote that I didn't want wine32 to be hidden (.wine32) ==> personal preference\nSTEP 3) \nInstall fonts\n\nWINEPREFIX=~/wine32 winetricks corefonts\n  WINEPREFIX=~/wine32 winetricks allfonts\n\nSTEP 4) \nInstall Dependencies for office 2010 (32 bit)\n\nWINEPREFIX=~/wine32 winetricks wininet riched30 vcrun2003 vcrun2005 vb3run\n\ndownload and run script: http://winezeug.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/install-addons.sh\nMake executable: you need to right click-> properties-> Permissions --> Allow to execute (CHECK yes)\n\n~/Downloads/install-addons.sh\n\nSTEP 5) \n\nWINEPREFIX=~/wine32 winecfg\n\n-> Libraries -> add msi(native, builtin) \n-> select msi(native, builtin) -> Edit -> change to (builtin, native)\nSTEP 6) \nRight Click the ISO in file explorer --> Open With Disk Image Mounter\nSTEP 7) \nRun setup\n\nWINEPREFIX=~/wine32 wine \"/media/user/Office2010 Plus/setup.exe\"\n\n(Note your ISO CD might not be named \"Office2010 Plus\", change as needed.)\nSTEP 8) WINEPREFIX=~/wine32 winecfg\n-> Libraries -> add riched20\nNow, under Libraries, you should have:\nExisting overrides:\n*atl80(native, builtin)\n*msvcm80(native, builtin)\n*msvcr80(native, builtin)\n*riched30(native, builtin)\n*vcomp(native, builtin)\n*winenet(native, builtin)\nmsi(builtin, native)\nriched20(native, builtin)\n\nSTEP 9) Create shortcuts\n9A) use favorite text editor and create \"WORD.desktop\" on Desktop\n[Desktop Entry] Version=1.0 \nName=WORD 2010 \nComment=Loads MS WORD 2010  Go go Ubuntu \nExec=sh /home/user/Documents/DesktopShorts/word.sh  #you must use a shell script\nIcon=/home/user/Documents/DesktopShorts/PNGs/word.png  #dl icons from images.google.com \nTerminal=false \nType=Application \nCategories=Utility;Application;Office; \nName[en_US]=WORD 2010\n\n9B) use favorite text editor to create \"word.sh\" \n\nenv WINEPREFIX=$HOME/wine32 wine \"$HOME/wine32/drive_c/Program\n  Files/Microsoft Office/Office14/WINWORD.EXE\"\n\nSTEP 10)\nIn file explorer, make WORD.desktop and word.sh executable\nSTEP 11) \nCopy these two files and make Excel, PowerPnt, OneNote, etc. as you desire.\nSTEP 12) \nDo not add anything to this WINEPREFIX=~/wine32.  Use a new WINEPREFIX for other programs.  You can break it, apparently.\nRESULTS\nEveything I normally use works:\nI use Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote on Linux.

You MUST shut down for Ubuntu to be able to mount it properly.\n\n\nFor this reason, I moved my Documents folder to a separate partition so I could leave Fastboot on and Hibernate windows 8 if I want.\n\n\n*\n\n*To move your Documents folder, hit Windows+E to open file explorer.  On the left, at top, right click \"Documents\"-> Properties-> Move -> select a new folder on a new drive.  Windows will copy everything over for you.  This will include your Outlook.pst files, which are buried in some Application_Data subfolder.\n\n\nA: Wine is a Windows application compatibility layer that allows you to run some Windows applications in Linux.\nAccording to Wine AppDB for MS Office 2010, MS Office 2010 (32-bit) is given a Platinum rating, ie; it installs and runs flawlessly on an out-of-the-box Wine installation. Wine Version 1.5.13 or better is required for greater compatibility.\nI have had much success getting office 2007 working, but nothing past that. I'd recommend taking a look into learning more about LibreOffice.\n\nA: You may try using Wine (see Software Center) for Windows applications. Not sure if Office 2010 will work. Although Office 2003 works fine for me.\n\nA: I got Xubuntu 14.04 and installed it via Wine first which failed miserably cause it was requiring MSXML 5.0...\nWhen I installed it via PlayOnLinux, amazingly it worked perfectly, it even installed the missing MSXML 5.0 but gave me an error on Outlook.exe, so it only installed Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote, the rest of them failed.\nSo, my advice is to install it via PlayOnLinux and not waste energy configuring Wine. \n\nA: Not exactly what you're looking for, but Dropbox lets you use Word, Excel, and Powerpoint for free with a personal account.

For the specific server that I plan on running, I've read online that it runs faster when hosted on a Linux based OS.  I have a copy of a Ubuntu Disk.  I don't plan on hosting this server often and wondered if it was worth the trouble booting from the disk (not installing) and just running the server from the live CD?\nAre there any drawbacks from being in the preview?  Will it nullify my benefits?\n\nA: You may be better off creating a virtual machine for your server using one of the freely available virtualization solutions like VirtualBox.\nThis permits you to host the server occasionally as desired, but does not suffer from the drawbacks of making it harder to install packages and store persistent data. The main thing to consider is the networking setup - you will need to establish NAT tunnels to the VM server ports for your services.\n\nA: Running any OS off of a CD is significantly slower than off of a hard drive, due to the limited speed of the drive.  I would recommend running it from a USB key or other solid-state removable media instead, since they are reasonably fast and they would be able to store data persistently. \n\nA: Ubuntu Server does not have a live CD so you would have to use the Desktop version. It would most likely be slower, and you wouldn't be able to save configuration info. A VM is your best choice. It wouldn't be much slower than a real system, and a personal server doesn't need much power anyway.

These certificates are used to establish a chain of trust from someone Ubuntu or Mozilla trusts to a particular site when https: is used. The chain of trust starts with certificates installed as part of your Ubuntu system.\nThe problem might ordinarily manifest itself when you use a web browser to make a secure connection to a web site. In this case add-apt-repository is using the https: protocol to securily add a repository and its authentication keys. The current Ubuntu ppa repositories require a chain of trust from MakeDaddy.com to Canonical. If you use Firefox to browse to the same repositories using https: you will probably see an error rather than a closed padlock for the site, and clicking that will provide error messages indicating that the chain of trust cannot be determined.\nEnter the following to reinstall the central authority certificates:\nsudo apt-get install --reinstall ca-certificates\n\nAnother helpful command for this:\nsudo update-ca-certificates\n\n\nA: You need to make sure your date is set, the certificates have a valid from date and if your system date is 01-01-1970, all certificates will fail.\nUse something like\ndate -s \"Oct 9 05:16:00 UTC 2012\"\n\nthen try again with add-apt-repository.\n\nA: I used to this get this error when i used the command in the terminal,\nbut when i added it from gui for the software sources it was added successfully.

Actually, now my battery last longer in Ubuntu than it does on Windows 7.\n\nA: You might use cpufrequtils to reduce the CPU frequency or cpufreqd to adjust that frequency depending on system load, active processes, temperature and so on. In case that cpufreq-info from cpufrequtils reports the governor ondemand and high frequencies, you might want to use top to see where that demand comes from, i.e. which processes keep the CPU busy.\n", "Q: Messed up my 12.04 graphics: Falsely installed NVidia drivers on HD Graphics OK hope you can help.

The Galaxy Nexus uses MTP which makes general use a bit of a pain. Luckily, Ubuntu comes with some drivers preinstalled so I can access my phones memory easily through nautilus, however Rhythmbox and Banshee don't seem to like it as much. Rhythmbox will crash when I try and sync and on Banshee I get a slew of errors. I am spoiled by the likes of DoubleTwist on Windows with which I could sync my iTunes library with wirelessly. Obviously neither iTunes nor DoubleTwist work on Ubuntu so I would like to find some alternative. Worst case scenario I can manually transfer all my music (trying to completely get rid of Windows here).\nNow, I know a lot of my ID3 tags in my music library are not what I like them to be (when I first launched Rhythmbox I had to rename a lot of stuff) and I'm really OCD about all that. When I edit my song information will it edit the ID3 tag? If so then I can manage my musics ID3 tags via Rhythmbox, and then manually transfer it.\nLoving Ubuntu and trying to get out of the grip Windows and OS X had on me for the longest time.\n\nA: You're right, MTP is a real pain under Linux. (Years ago) I used to update my Creative ZEN Mozaic with Gnomad2 but it was far from perfect.\nMy personal advice is to root your phone and install Samba Filesharing to have traditional Samba shares on your phone.\nIf you really don't want to root your phone, you can take a look to this thread. It seems that ASTRO File Manager plus its SMB Module can work even without root access (not tested by me, can't confirm). AirDroid could be another alternative to test.\n\nA: Google the \"SGS3 Easy UMS\" app (Not available in the market). It makes the device read as a UMS device (Mass Storage). Make sure your Galaxy is rooted first!\n\nA: I realize that this is an old question, but I found it when I was searching for a method to use for 4.4.2 KitKat, so others may as well.\nThe methods above worked great prior to Android KitKat 4.4.2. However, with the restriction on writing to the SD card by non-system apps, starting with KitKat, you're out of luck if you use an external SD card for your media. This is the workaround that I've come up with. It's not ideal, but it works without rooting your phone.\nThe workaround is basically two parts:\n\n\n*\n\n*Write your media to an external flash drive that has been configured as a Media Player. You can do this by creating an .is_audio_player file at the root of the flash drive. I've included a sample, below.\n\n*Use rsync (or the graphical version, grsync (this is what I use)), to sync your media from your external flash drive to your Android, which has been mounted as an MTP device. I've included a sample rsync command line below.\nSample .is_audio_player file:\nname=\"My Android\"\naudio_folders=Music/\nplaylist_path=Music/\nvideo_folders=Video/\naudiobook_folders=AudioBook/\noutput_formats=audio/mpeg,audio/mp4,audio/flac,audio/ogg,audio/aac\nplaylist_formats=audio/mpegurl,audio/x-mpegurl,audio/m3u\n\nSample rsync command line:\nrsync -r -v --progress --delete -u -s /media/$USER/[YOUR_FLASH_DRIVE]/Music /run/user/$USER/gvfs/[YOUR_DEVICE]/SD card/\n\nPlease note that for pre-Kit Kat Androids without mass storage (or if you write your media to the internal SD card), this same method will work by mounting your Android as an external SFTP mountpoint (i.e., by using a utility like SSHDroid) and pointing the destination directory to the SFTP mountpoint.\nThis is not an ideal solution. The ideal solution would be for the creators of Rhythmbox to rewrite their app to properly connect with MTP players that have been mounted by the OS. But this is an acceptable workaround - and it definitely works!\nNote that this has only been tested under Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr, but it uses standard Linux utilities, so it should work on earlier versions as well, as long as your player will mount via MTP and is visible by the OS.\n", "Q: Can't upload project to PPA using Quickly I can't get Quickly to upload my project into my PPA.

A bit confused, is postfix to receive or send email?\nI am using a 3rd party to send email, and just need to receive email and was wondering if postfix is what I should be researching.\n\nA: Both: Postfix is a mail transfer agent (MTA), and it can transfer mail in both directions (from a local program to a distant machine, from a distant machine to a local program, and it can also relay mails between machines if needed).\nIf you have a machine with a permanent Internet connection (preferably with a static IP address, but that is not required) and you wish to receive mail directly at this machine, then Postfix is the right tool (or some other MTA — but Postfix is the default MTA in Ubuntu and is a reasonable choice). If your server is myserver.example.com and you want to receive mail for username@example.com, then all you need is to run Postfix and set up an MX record for example.com with your DNS provider. If you want to receive mail for username@myserver.example.com, you don't even need an MX record. If you want to receive mail that comes from some other machine, you'll need to convince that machine to bounce the mail to your server.\nIf you want to feed mail periodically from some server, then Postfix isn't the right tool, but it can be part of the tool chain. You can use fetchmail or a similar program to periodically retrieve mail from an external IMAP or POP3 server, and either drop it directly to your mail reader's inbox or route it through Postfix as a local mail delivery system.\nFor sending mail, you can set up Postfix to talk to that third party and tell your mail user agent to route mails through your machine's email system.\n\nA: Postfix is actually a bit of both; it's a mail transfer agent, or MTA.\nHowever, note that if you only wish to fetch mail, you may find it easier to install and configure the aptly named fetchmail program to accomplish this task.\n", "Q: Why is my external USB hard drive sometimes completely inaccessible? I have an external USB hard drive, consisting of an 1 TB SATA drive in a Rosewill RX35-AT-SU SLV Aluminum 3.5\" Silver USB 2.0 External Enclosure, plugged into my SONY VAIO VGN-NS310F laptop. It is plugged directly into the computer (not through a hub). The drive inside the enclosure is a 7200 rpm Western Digital, but I don't remember the exact model. I can remove the drive from the enclosure (again), if people think it's necessary to know that detail.\nThe drive is formatted ext4. I mount it dynamically with udisks on my Lubuntu 11.10 system, usually automatically via PCManFM. (I have had Lubuntu 12.04 on this machine, and experienced all this same behavior with that too.) Every once in a while--once or twice a day--it becomes inaccessible, and difficult to unmount. Attempting to unmount it with sudo umount ... gives an error message saying the drive is in use and suggesting fuser and lsof to find out what is using it. Killing processes found to be using the drive with fuser and lsof is sometimes sufficient to let me unmount it, but usually isn't.\nOnce the drive is unmounted or the machine is rebooted, the drive will not mount. Plugging in the drive and turning it on registers nothing on the computer. dmesg is unchanged. The drive's access light usually blinks vigorously, as though the drive is being accessed constantly. Then eventually, after I keep the drive off for a while (half an hour), I am able to mount it again.\nWhile the drive doesn't work on this machine for a while, it will work immediately on another machine running the same version of Ubuntu. Sometimes bringing it back over from the other machine seems to \"fix\" it. Sometimes it doesn't.\nThe drive doesn't always stop being accessible while mounted, before becoming unmountable. Sometimes it works fine, I turn off the computer, I turn the computer back on, and I cannot mount the drive.\nCurrently this is the only drive with which I have this problem, but I've had problems that I think are the same as this, with different drives, on different Ubuntu machines. This laptop has another external USB drive plugged into it regularly, which doesn't have this problem. Unplugging that drive before plugging in the \"problem\" drive doesn't fix the problem.\nI've opened the drive up and made sure the connections were tight in the past, and that didn't seem to help (any more than waiting the same amount of time that it took to open and close the drive, before attempting to remount it).\nDoes anyone have any ideas about what could be causing this, what troubleshooting steps I should perform, and/or how I could fix this problem altogether?\nUpdate: I tried replacing the USB data cable (from the enclosure to the laptop), as Merlin suggested. I should've tried that long ago, since it fits the symptoms perfectly (the drive works on another machine, which would make sense because the cable would be bent at a different angle, possibly completing a circuit of frayed wires). Unfortunately, though, this did not help--I have the same problem with the new cable. I'll try to provide additional detailed information about the drive inside the enclosure, next time I'm able to get the drive working. (At the moment I don't have another machine available to attach it.)\nMajor Update (28 June 2012)\nThe drive seems to have deteriorated considerably. I think this is so, because I've attached it to another machine and gotten lots of errors about invalid characters, when copying files from it. I am less interested in recovering data from the drive than I am in figuring out what is wrong with it. I specifically want to figure out if the problem is the drive or the enclosure.\nNow, when I plug the drive into the original machine where I was having the problems, it still doesn't appear (including with sudo fdisk -l), but it is recognized by the kernel and messages are added to dmesg. Most of the message consist of errors like this, repeated many times:\n[    7.707593] sd 5:0:0:0: [sdc] Unhandled sense code\n[    7.707599] sd 5:0:0:0: [sdc]  Result: hostbyte=invalid driverbyte=DRIVER_SENSE\n[    7.707606] sd 5:0:0:0: [sdc]  Sense Key : Medium Error [current] \n[    7.707614] sd 5:0:0:0: [sdc]  Add.

Please note that:\n\n*\n\n*I'm back to running Lubuntu 12.04 on this machine (and perhaps that's a factor in better error messages).\n\n*Now that the drive has been plugged into another machine and back into this one, and also now that this machine is back to running 12.04, the drive's access light doesn't blink as I had described. Looking at the drive, it would appear as though it is working normally, with low or no access.\n\n*This behavior (the errors) occurs when rebooting the machine with the drive plugged in, and also when manually plugging in the drive.\n\n*A few of the messages are about /dev/sdb. That drive is working fine. The bad drive is /dev/sdc. I just didn't want to edit anything out from the middle.\n\n\nA: To determine whether the problem is the drive or the enclosure, remove the drive from the enclosure, install it in a desktop with sufficient power and check the smart status.\nFor a deeper test, you can check every sector of the drive utilizing tools like ddrescue. ddrescue will report error size during the process and you can attempt data recovery at the same time as in: sudo ddrescue /dev/sdb2 /path/to/recovery.image logfile. List the partitions with sudo lsblk or classic fdisk -l.\nIf you truly have no interest in the data you can force the output file to /dev/null as in: \nsudo ddrescue --force /dev/sdc /dev/null logfile \n\nand you'll still get a report on any error size on stdout\nTested on Ubuntu 14.04 with GNU ddrescue 1.17 as follows inthis short example using /dev/sdb2 (a 1MB swap partition)\n$ sudo ddrescue --force /dev/sdb2 /dev/null logfile\n\n\nGNU ddrescue 1.17\nPress Ctrl-C to interrupt\nrescued:      1024 B,  errsize:       0 B,  current rate:     1024 B/s\n   ipos:         0 B,   errors:       0,    average rate:     1024 B/s\n   opos:         0 B,    time since last successful read:       0 s\n\n\nA: I had similar experiences when I was running 12.04 Ubuntu desktop.  My hard drive enclosure had 2 options for power, I could either buy an a/c adapter or use 1 mini usb to normal usb cable, or use a mini usb cable into two usb cables.  Ideally it needed to be connected to both usb ports to supply ample power.  It could transfer data over the usb cable or over eSata.\nWhen using the eSata connection I needed to first supply the drive power so the disk was spinning and then boot the system so the bios would recognize the already spinning disk.  Otherwise it would not see the disk in time.  I believe this has something to do with the controller for the enclosure.\nWhen I mounted the USB I had very mixed results when plugging the cable first into the enclosure and second into the USB ports.  Maybe about half of the time it would mount correctly.  If I plugged the usb cables into the pc ports first and then into the enclosure second I had much better results at around 70%.  The best results I got with the USB options was using an external power source(a/c adapter) for the enclosure to make sure the disk was spinning and stable before I plugged it in to the machine.  Worked pretty much 100%\nNot saying that this is exactly your issue, but for me it helped to provide the enclosure power and have the disk spinning before connecting it to have it read be the system.  Perhaps the bios or bus speed on your one system is better than the other and it give time for the enclosures controller to start working before it tries to read the disk?  And perhaps some time after the enclosure is unplugged the controller resets itself?  \nMaybe the controller needs to time to decide whether it is just getting power from the USB's or power and data.  Maybe its a voltage or amperage issue?  Eitherway enclosure controllers seem to be finicky.\n\nA: For your USB drive try the following steps(if you have not done this already):\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo fdisk -l #get info\n\n*sudo mkdir /media/external #create mount point\n\n*sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb1 /media/external -o uid=1000,gid=1000,utf8,dmask=027,fmask=137 #mount.\n\n\nOr try using pmount for mounting your USB.\n\nA: I would suggest there could also be a problem with your USB bus driver chip or similar.  Do you have any tools to list all USB devices?  Try running those tools when the drive is working properly, and when the drive is inaccessible.  Do you see any differences?\nOlder (and cheaper) drives go through a process called \"Thermal Recalibration\" (TACL) which happens every hour or so, and they can become inaccessible for several seconds while the drive estimates how much the disk head is being bent by heat build-up in the drive.  During TCL the stepper motor and coil seek to every track and the head is aligned on every track, and the results are stored.  This is an internal feature of the firmware.  It sounds like this process is either getting stuck, or perhaps it is producing the wrong answers, making it impossible to access the drive after thermal recalibration.\nThe error you posted from dmesg indicates there are problems on sdc, sector 0, logical block 0.  These low-numbered blocks often contain the geometry of the drive (i.e. the hard or soft formatting).  If these blocks are going bad, the whole drive may become inaccessible, permanently.  The media failure may be heat related, which might explain why a period of inactivity (moving the drive to another machine) sometimes fixes it, sometimes doesn't fix it.\nTo figure out if the problem is thermal-related, turn on the computer and start a stopwatch, but don't really use the drive - just wait for it to fail, and record how long it takes to fail.  Then, turn it off and leave it off for several hours to cool down, then re-run the test, turn on the computer and drive, but start a huge data-intensive drive-drive copy (same drive).  Doing more work with the stepper motor will presumably cause the drive to heat up quicker, and cause it to fail sooner.  If there is a big change in failure delay, then the drive is toast and I would get another one.  Good luck!\n\nA: Quite often this type of problem is caused by lack of sufficient power coming down the USB cable to the drive, and this is particularly likely where the external drive was not bought off-the-shelf but self-assembled. (You would hope that a manufacturer of an external drive would have made sure that USB ports could support it.)\nA device may draw up to 500 mA from a port in the USB 2.0 spec and up to 900 mA in USB 3.0. By checking the manufacturer's specifications of the external drive you might be able to confirm the maximum power requirements of your drive.\nThe problem can often by fixed by trying a USB3 port (if you have one, and you haven't already tried this), because they provide more power than USB2, or to get a USB Y cable so that the drive can get power from 2 ports instead of 1. These are available inexpensively on eBay or Amazon.\n\nA: Although the real cause of the problem was already pointed out, I want to add the same answer, since I have some 4 external HDDs.\nAny computer that is manufactured, assumes that the power source will be used accordingly to the specifications of the configuration and at most an overload of 20%\nAny external USB device HAS TO BE POWERED FROM AN EXTERNAL POWERED HUB, in order to protect the computer's power source.\nThe behaviour described is a typical behaviour for power overload. Supposing you have also an external DVD, this would fail your recordings also and even might render irrecoverable your device(s) and further more, even your computer.\nLaptops usually brake this way, since users tend to use passive USB hubs or computer-powered devices, including HDDs, DVDs and the like.\nBuy an external powered USB hub and connect the USB devices THROUGH A POWERED USB PORT, instead of draining the power from computer's source, since this approach will damage more than your HDD. A power surge is mostly the same as an underpowered computer or external device.\nThe USB standard has nothing to do with the underpowered device.\nThink of it like this: if you want power from your car, what fuel would you use? Anything that burns, or the manufacturer's specified fuel?\nIt is exactly the same here. \nUsing UNPOWERED USB devices, drains power from the internal power source of the computer. It already has enough devices attached to it!\n", "Q: How to have  colored manual pages in  gnome-terminal When I switched to tty I noticed manpages look different by using some color scheme.

I don't know what the exact executable file extension is. Is it .deb or .tar.gz?\n\nA: There is no standard File-Extention like an \".exe\" file in Windows.\nOn Linux nearly any file can be executable.\nThe file ending just describes (but not necessarily) what or how a file is \"executed\".\nFor example a shell script ends with .sh and is \"executed\" via the bash shell.\nIn your question you ask for .deb and .tar.gz\nWell, the .deb file installs software on your system (Please be careful!)\nAnd the .tar.gz file is a compressed file like a .zip that you could know from Windows.\n\nA: Linux does not use the file extension to determine if a file is executable.  It uses a file attribute called the executable bit.\nAny file can be marked executable, and when attempting to execute a file Linux will look at the start of the file to see what type of executable it is.\nTypes of executable files\n\n*\n\n*Binary executables in Linux usually use the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file format.  These are Linux's equivalent to the PE (Portable Executable) format used in Windows or the MZ and NE formats used in DOS and early Windows versions, all of which used the EXE file extension.  That is, these formats consist of binary, compiled code but may be large and may embed other items in the file.\nInterestingly, the ELF file format also forms the equivalent of the Windows DLL file, because Linux also uses the format for shared libraries which contain functions callable from other executables.\nWhen executing an ELF format file, Linux recognises the file type from its magic number - the first four bytes are 7f 45 4c 46 - the 7f is included to avoid misclassification of text files.  This is similar to the way Windows can distinguish the different executable formats that all use the EXE file extension.\n\n\n*Linux also allows direct execution of text-based script files, which serve a similar purpose to Batch files in DOS/Windows.  Linux's scripting support is extensible in the sense you can install or create any scripting language you like and configure your Linux installation to be able to run scripts in that language, by specifying in the script which binary should be used to interpret that script.\nLinux installations have a default script interpreter available at /bin/sh which interprets any scripts that don't otherwise specify which interpreter to use.  This script interpreter interprets shell scripts that adhere to scripting standard specified in POSIX, an initiative to standardize Unix-like operating systems.  Historically Linux's POSIX-compliant script interpreter has been bash - an open source re-implementation based on the Unix bourne shell and others - with bash so commonly used that in the Linux community such scripts are commonly referred to as bash scripts, but other scripting interpreters supporting POSIX may be used at /bin/sh including dash.\nOther scripting interpreters commonly used in Linux include perl and python.  Within the script, you use a hashbang on the first line to specify which interpreter should be used.  Here are some examples:\n #!/bin/perl\n\n #!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nIn the second example, /usr/bin/env allows reading an environment variable to determine the executable to run.\nExecutable attribute\nThe executable bit forms part of a file's file permissions, and can be specified separately for the owner and group of the file, or for world (everyone).  A user who does not have execute permission applicable to them sees the file as a regular, non-executable file.\n\nA: The concept of an executable is different in unix/linux than Windows.\nWindows\nAnything that ends in .exe or .com becomes an executable file.\nLinux/Unix\nEach and every file has an executable bit, so any file can be executed, unlike Windows. To see if a file is executable, you can check its properties (Permissions tab), or even see them marked in the terminal (they are all marked with a *).\nEven text files (like shell scripts) can have their executable bits set, and be run as one.\n\nA: In windows, an  .exe file is a computer file that ends with the extension \".exe\" commonly known as executable file. When one clicks on an exe file, a built-in routine automatically executes code that can set several functions into motion. Exe files are commonly used to install files in the windows operating system.\nAdditionally, you have .tar files,commonly known as compressed files.Linux versions, such as Ubuntu use features prominently in various software distributions, with most software source code made available in the tar.gz format .From that you can assume that tar.gz is a form of the well know .tar format, which is used for archiving.\nIn Ubuntu on the other hand, the .deb file format is the one that behaves more like the .exe file in windows.When you open it the software center handles it's code and installs the program it contains, such as an executable file.\nEven though you can still install software and packages from source format ( tar.gz), the best suited format for installing software is the .deb one.Take as example the Ubuntu Software Center; all the applications it contains are in fact .deb files.In general, in linux, almost every file format(including .deb and tar.gz as well as the well know bash files .sh) can behave as an executable file so that you can install packages or software with that.\n\nA: To find out what a UNIX operating system thinks a particular file's type is, you use the file command:\n$ file /bin/ls\n/bin/ls: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1, for OpenBSD, statically linked, stripped\n\nIn the above example, I give the path to the program 'ls', you would replace with the path of your file.\nA script file would look like:\n$ file script.sh\nscript.sh: Bourne-Again shell script text\n\nA random text file:\n$ file textfile\ntextfile: ASCII text\n\nAn archive file:\n$ file rsync-3.0.6.tar.gz\nrsync-3.0.6.tar.gz: gzip compressed data, from Unix\n\nIt is even smart enough to correctly identify a windows program, should you happen to have one lying around on your UNIX box:\n$ file FMZsetup.exe\nFMZsetup.exe: MS-DOS executable (EXE), OS/2 or Windows\n\nAnd when it can't figure out what a file is (but is able to open it), it calls it data:\n$ file myrandom\nmyrandom: data\n\n\nA: File execution on Linux isn't related at all to the file name or extension. Any file can potentially be executed, provided that it's handled by the kernel's binfmt mechanism (and that its executable permissions are set).\nThe most common format for executable is ELF, although some kernels can be compiled for support of the old a.out format. (For full technical details, binfmt_elf.c is where to look.)\nAnother common mechanism is the \"Shebang\" system, handled by binfmt_script, which looks for #!/path/to/interpreter at the beginning of the file.\nbinfmt_misc allows for the registration of other handlers, as documented here.\nIf you fancy doing a bit of kernel programming, you can even write your own.\nAlthough not directly related, the file command should tell you whether a file is an ELF executable or something else.\nThe naming convention has nothing to do with the executable status of a file (except when it's used for binfmt_misc registration). They're just conventions. Typically, a .exe file found on Linux could be a mono application, getting the .exe extension as a convention coming from the Windows/.Net world.\nThe other aspect that can happen when you want to \"run\" a file is to have the file explorer tool that you use register extensions to be able to launch a program that will open these files. This is what would happen if you double click on a .txt, .tar.gz or .deb, for example: the files are not executables nor executed, but what you use to double-click chooses which executable to launch to open these files.\n\nA: \n\n\n\nLinux extension\nWindows Equivalent\nShort description\n\n\n\n\n[none], .bin, .elf(rare),\n.exe, .com(rare)\nBinary executables\n\n\n.so, .o\n.dll\nShared libraries\n\n\n.a\n.lib\nStatic library, for linking into an executable\n\n\n[none], .sh\n.bat\nShell script\n\n\n[none], .pl, .php, .py, etc\n.cmd, .vbs\nOther scripting languages which may be used\n\n\n.exe\n.exe\nLinux may be configured to execute some Windows executables using mono or wine\n\n\n.deb, .rpm, etc\n.msi\nInstaller package for the various distributions.

These are based on the PE/COFF unix files.\nRead http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Executable for more information.\nIn Ubuntu you don't have a specific extension for an executable file.  These are generally files that are named after the application they relate too.\nThe important factor is that these files have the executable bit set.  If you have a color terminal you will notice that these are a different color when listed using ls.\nIn the unix file system binary executable files are generally stored in there own location.\n\n\n*\n\n*/bin (core binaries)\n\n*/sbin (system binaries)\n\n*/usr/bin (application binaries)\n\n\nwhereas other application resources may be stored in /usr/lib/ or /usr/share/\nA deb file is more correctly corresponded to an msi file in windows (i.e a package installer).\nGenerally tar.gz files or bz2 files contain source code from which an application can be built\n\nA: Ubuntu equallant of .exe / .com file is extensionless file, usually some extensions like .bin ,.run etc are added to it for covinience\nthere are several alternatives for .bat file(almost all files),the most popular one is .sh\n.deb is just an archive binary files(similar to .msi in windows) with debian standerds\n.tar.gz is just a common archiving format used in ubuntu\n\nA: Any filename can be set to executable regardless of extension, but the file needs to have the appropriate permission set. The permission may be given by right-clicking the file in Nautilus, clicking Properties, and ticking the \"Allow executing file as program\" checkbox:\n\n\nA: .deb Debian Package for Linux and TAR archive compressed with the standard GNU zip (gzip) compression algorithm; contains one or more compressed files; commonly used on Unix operating systems to package files, programs, and installers.\nNOTE: TAR.GZ files must first be decompressed and then expanded using a TAR utility. They include both .TAR and .GZ file types.\n", "Q: How to add Fade-out and Fade-in Effects by convert command? convert command can make the mpeg video from the several pictures.\nFor example:\nconvert -delay 300 *.png test.mpg\n\nWell, is it possible to add Fade-out and Fade-in effects into the mpeg video by using convert ?\nIf it is possible, how can I do it?\n\nA: I'd personally stick to video tools for generating video. Imagemagick is pretty awesome but it's no ffmpeg. ffmpeg (or avconv as it's now known) can handle both frame-stitching and fade options in one go:\nffmpeg -r 24 -b 500000 -i frame%05d.png -vf fade=out:155:45 output.mp4\n\nIf you're not familiar with ffmpeg, here's a quick translation of that command:\n\n\n*\n\n*24fps\n\n*~500kbps bitrate\n\n*Uses all images called frame{00000..99999}.png\n\n*starts fading out at at frame 155 with a fade duration of 45 frames\n\n*outputs to output.mp4\n\n\nffmpeg also gives you a ton of options about handling audio, codecs, containers, etc that Imagemagick wont, but I'm leaving that well alone.

Specifically, on starting up it tries to create a folder .adobe in your home directory. However, due to some reason (perhaps during install) a symlink file of the same name already exists: .adobe --> /dev/null. So, the program throws and error and quits, as seen by running it from the terminal:\n\n$ acroread\nAcroread was unable to create the directory .adobe in your\n  home directory.

My environment matches this bug report\n[https://forums.adobe.com/message/4721987][1]\nwhich points out that Adobe has a bug reading the its own config from an XFS file system larger than 1T.

Note that this solution isn't perfect, Acrobat treats every launch as the first one, asked you to acknowledge the EULA, etc. The author also provides a shell script to try and work around that issue.\n\nA: I had the same problem with acroread on a XFS partition with more than 1 TB.\nI copied the directory /home/<homedir>/.adobe to a  smaller partition and made a symlink /home/<homedir>/.adobe on the copied directory.\nAfter that, acroread works fine.\n\nA: I had an almost identical problem.\nThe added wrinkle: the /home area was a bind mount from a very large drive.\nThis meant that acroread would still crash shortly after launching, even if .adobe was a symlink to an area of a smaller drive.\nI modified /bin/acroread to export the HOME environment variable pointing to a directory per user on a smaller drive, in a location where the user could write.\nThis could be e.g. /tmp/acroHome$USER which would allow write for each user.\nThere may be a less messy solution, but it did work when I did this and supported user customisations.\n", "Q: Dual boot - 12.04 installed first I have found many guides with how to install windows and ubuntu in dual boot mode, but none from the perspective of a Ubuntu user.

With VirtualBox, you install and run Windows within a running copy of Ubuntu.

I've read several similar grub error questions and answers, researched on Google (a lot), but still have not found a solution to my problem.\nI have an \"old\" notebook where I've installed Windows XP and then Ubuntu 8.04 - everything worked well for a long time. After the kids played with it (i.e. I have not seen what happened), I couldn't boot anymore. Grub simply said Error 17, and nothing else. After several Error 17 failures, the error changed to Error 18 - and this is the error it shows now.\nWhat have I tried? I tried several Linux LIVE CD's and DVD's I have: Ubuntu 8.04, Kubuntu 10.04, Ubuntu 10.04, Ubuntu 11.10, Fedora 11, etc. - none of them is able to start, in all modes and options I tried (I have not manually edited the commands, but tried the provided options). I can't use the Live CD OS, and I can't install them either. This is important: it is ok to erase all HD contents! It is ok to format, repartition, lose all HD data - no problem.\nIn most of the Ubuntu flavours, including the 8.04 CD, the initialization stucks, showing repeatedly the following error messages:\nata3.00: exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x0\nata3.00: BMDMA stat 0x25\nata3.00: cmd 25/00:08:e5:a5:50/00:00:12:00:00/e0 tag 0 dma 1024 in\nata3.00: status: { DRDY ERR }\nata3.00: error: { UNC }\n\nI also have tried the Windows XP installation CD.

I just want to use my notebook again.\nThanks!\n\nA: From what you say, it doesn't sound like a problem with GRUB or any other operating system.  GRUB is the first thing that is read on the hard drive, but it seems like you are having problems even reading the hard drive at all.  It may be a hard drive failure on the laptop, which definitely happens eventually to any hard drive, especially laptops that move around while the drive is spinning and also have reduced airflow (especially when old and clogged up with years of dust inside).\nBut the fact that you are having trouble reading all of the CDs makes it seem like it might be something causing all the disks to fail, like a controller card or something.  It's possible to have multiple failures at once, but seems unlikely.  \nIf it was me, and I really wanted to resurrect the laptop, I would try to first take apart as much as I can and clean it out with a vacuum cleaner and perhaps compressed air, getting out as much dust as possible.  Sometimes dust makes the cpu fan stop, and when that happens, all sorts of errors occur.  I once had a computer where the fan had stopped, and I thought I had a virus, as it kept getting strange errors right away.\nIf you can't get a CD to boot properly, nothing else will work, though.\n\nA: 8.04 is no longer supported ( on the desktop ).  It also looks like your drive may be failing.  Download the 12.04 cd, boot it up, open the disk utility and check the SMART status of the drive for errors.\n\nA: Give this a try if you are getting grub rescue:\n\n\n*\n\n*At grub>. enter these commands\nfind /boot/grub/stage1\n\nThis will return a location.

Reboot the machine.\n\nAnother option is to run this command:\ngrub-install /dev/hda\n\n\nA: ata3.00: exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x0\nata3.00: BMDMA stat 0x25\nata3.00: cmd 25/00:08:e5:a5:50/00:00:12:00:00/e0 tag 0 dma 1024 in\nata3.00: status: { DRDY ERR }\nata3.00: error: { UNC }\n\nNothing to do with the grub for this error message.\nThe error message you have obtained is purely related to the hard disk being used.\nThere is a sector corruption in the hard disk onto which the information required by grub has been stored.\nSo when grub tries to get the required information, it fails because of corrupted sector in the hard disk.\nMy suggestion,\n you can better change the Hard disk, because all the methods to recover this particular error will only work temporarily (Not even sure that the hard disk will recover from this error).\n", "Q: Why can't I get sound through HDMI with nVidia GTX580 I've just installed the newest version of ALSA and my NVIDIA device showed up in the gnome-volume-control.

I would like to have one global Template directory. One option, that I think can be possible is to create a link(shortcut or how is it called in linux) to Template, but then Template file would still be in my folder and I don't know where to put global Template folder, where is a place, that should be used by it (maybe /opt?). So basically:\n\n\n*\n\n*Is it possible to create one global Template folder instead of Template for every user? And how?

I would suggest you should give read-only rights with a common group shared by those users of a client.  Obviously try to avoid 777 rights to this folder since this makes the folder read-writable to everyone and anyone.\nNote 2 - the XDG_TEMPLATES_DIR folder needs to be EITHER a folder locate in the users home or  an absolute folder (full path to the folder starting with /)\nNote 3 - you dont necessarily need to modify user-dirs.dirs.  You could remove the local home-folder and soft-link it to your global templates folder i.e.\ncd ~/\nrmdir Templates\nln -s /opt/Templates Templates\n\nNote 4 - logout and login for changes to take effect\n", "Q: Is it safe have more than one version of java?

I have about 200+ shareware files in zip format that each contain a file called \"FILE_ID.DIZ\".  I need to know how to rename each instance to lowercase \"file_id.diz\" without doing it manually - I've already gone that route and it's pretty time consuming.  That file has to be lowercase because the BBS program I'm using ignores the FILE_ID.DIZ as a description since it is uppercase.  If I manually change it to lowercase, the description is imported successfully. \nI know that rar has a renaming switch, but then I'd have to batch convert all of the zip files to rar, and then back to zip.  I'm not ruling that out entirely, but it seems like the long way around to resolving this.\nI found the man page for \"zip_rename\", which looks like it might do the trick, but I have no idea how to actually implement it.\nI refuse to do this on a Windows machine - I just can't and won't do it... it's the principle ;).\nAnyway, thanks for your time!\n\nA: This technique won't rename the file, but add a lowercase version of the .DIZ file. Hopefully it will be good enough for your purposes.\nThis takes advantage of zip's \"add by default\" functionality, in which if you specify an existing zip file, it will add files to it. So if you do:\nzip doom.zip file_id.diz\n\nand doom.zip exists, it will just add the file_id.diz file to the existing contents.\nThis is to be run in the directory where your zip files reside:\nfor i in  *zip; do rm FILE_ID.DIZ;  unzip \"$i\" FILE_ID.DIZ; mv FILE_ID.DIZ file_id.diz; zip -d \"$i\" FILE_ID.DIZ; zip \"$i\" file_id.diz; done\n\nNote that for best results, none of the .zip file names should contain spaces.\nYou can also put this in a file, say, rename.sh (and it looks nicer and easier to understand this way):\n#!/bin/bash\nfor i in  *zip; do\n   rm FILE_ID.DIZ\n   unzip \"$i\" FILE_ID.DIZ\n   mv FILE_ID.DIZ file_id.diz\n   zip -d \"$i\" FILE_ID.DIZ\n   zip \"$i\" file_id.diz\ndone\n\nthen you can run by saying, e.g. bash rename.sh\n\nA: You can use the rename function of zipnote of info-zip:\nhttp://www.info-zip.org/FAQ.html#rename\nfor zip_filename in *.zip; do\n    # Only process original zip files.\n    if [ \"${zip_filename%.fixed.zip}\" = \"${zip_filename}\" ] ; then\n        # Create a copy which will be modified later.\n        cp ${zip_filename} ${zip_filename%.zip}.fixed.zip\n\n        # Get all filenames, change some of them on the fly and write them to the zip file.\n        zipnote ${zip_filename} \\\n          | sed -e 's/^@ \\(.*\\)FILE_ID.DIZ/@ \\1FILE_ID.DIZ\\n@=\\1file_id.diz/' \\\n          | zipnote -w ${zip_filename%.zip}.fixed.zip\n    fi\ndone\n\n", "Q: Quickly share error (Can't upload to ppa) I'm using quickly and I can't seem to upload to my ppa.

If gpg is not setup properly then that will obviously fail, but also if your key's uid does not correspond with the changelog entry, it will fail to sign as well.\nIf you use debuild -us -S that will create an unsigned package.

In my first attempt, I selected \"download updates\" and \"install third-party components\"; in my second attempt, I deselected both. Still experiencing the same problem.\nIn my first attempt at installing Ubuntu, after the installation stuck at \"Retrieving file 43 of 105\", I selected \"skip\" and the installation completed. After I started to run the OS, I received a notification that language support was incomplete. When I tried to update it, the Ubuntu Software Centre updating process hung on \"waiting for jockey-backend to exit\", seemingly indefinitely.\nAt that point, I decided to reinstall the system (since the whole process is only supposed to take 45 minutes or less), but, as I mentioned above my results were the same.\nI'm new to Ubuntu.

It's just installing the normal software updates during installation to save you the trouble of doing it after installation.\nYou can ignore the problem during installation, and then try again after your system is up and running. If you're consistently having connections problems with your update mirror consider selecting a new one:\n\n\n*\n\n*How can I get apt to use a mirror close to me, or choose a faster mirror?\n\nA: Like Emmanuel said, disconnecting from all networks is probably the best solution to get a clean install.  I do lots of installations at my school where we are behind a proxy; downloading updates while installing always leads to issues, and sometimes the installation errors out without downloading update selected simply because the computer is connected via Ethernet.\nSo, when installing, you have two options to prevent network activity:\n\n\n*\n\n*Unplug the Ethernet cable from your computer (wired network), and don't connect to a wireless network; this is my suggestion\n\n*When Ubuntu loads and asks you to try or install, click the network notification icon, and click to uncheck \"Enable Networking\"\n\n\nAfter you get a successful installation, use the terminal to update, so you can see more clearly where the update is failing.  Open a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and type this and press the enter key:\n\nsudo apt-get update\n\nIf this does not return any errors, proceed by typing this and pressing enter:\n\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\n", "Q: Grub is not presenting kernel 3.2 as an option I'm running Ubuntu 12.04.

This system is also an upgrade, although I no longer recall what the original version I was running; perhaps its age is to blame.\nThe long and the short, though, is that I need to have my VirtualBox kernel modules in order to run my VirtualBox machines, however the repositories install them for kernel 3.2 -- not 3.0! I certainly could install the kernel 3.0 modules myself -- that's not beyond my capabilities -- but that seems like dodging the real issue, which is that Ubuntu and/or Grub are somehow mis-configured to boot an outdated kernel. So the question really is: How do I get the 3.2 kernel into Grub's menu selection (and ideally as the default selection) without messing things up any further (i.e. so that I don't find myself right back here again with the next kernel update)?\nI did try apt-get install linux-image-generic --reinstall, to no avail -- Grub still doesn't show any 3.2 kernel options, and boot into this 3.0 kernel by default. It seems really strange that a kernel update, which has always updated Grub's menu in the past, would leave itself entirely off the menu...\nEdit: I didn't pay much attention to the tag, but checking further I just discovered that I have the package grub installed, but there's a grub2 package available which is not installed. Should I be on grub2, or is that not the problem?\n\nA: You should have grub-pc package installed. With that, run:\ncd /boot/\nsudo update-grub\n\n", "Q: Why does GtkCalendar counts months from 0? So I spent several hours in rage, figuring out why isn't my code writing to the /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm correctly. The problem is that it doesn't return anything if the value is wrong. And finally I noticed this small  \n5\nbetween the year and the day. Why isn't it counting days and years from zero for consistency?\nFor comparison: QCalendarWidget counts month from 1 to 12 (docs)\n\nA: Doc for GtkCalendar: http://developer.gnome.org/gtk/2.24/GtkCalendar.html\nGeneral explaination for zero based:\nThe use of zero to start counting is actually an optimization trick from Assembly programmers. Instead of assigning 1 to the count register, they XOR'ed the register with itself, which was slightly faster in CPU cycles. This meant that counting would start with 0 and would always be up to the length of elements, excluding the last one.\nAlso, the use of zero is also popular with pointer arithmetics where you would use one base pointer pointing at some allocated memory, plus a second pointer which would be at an offset from this base pointer. Here, using the value zero makes a lot of sense to point the offset to the base of the memory block. (General array logic tends to be the base address plus the offset x record size.)\nAnd zero-based month numbers? Often, many programming environments calculate the data as a number of days since some default data. December 31, 1899 is a popular date, although there have been plenty of other dates used as base date. All other dates are offset from this base, and will just be stored as one single number. Fractions would be used to indicate hours, minutes and seconds, where 0.25 would be 24/4 = 6 hours. Thus, to transform a date into a real date, all the environment has to do is transform this number into a real date.\nHowever, the combination of zero-based arrays and 1-based month values does bring a problem. To get the month name of month 9, you would have to get item 8 from the month array. Some developers would be happy with decreasing the month number before getting it's name. Others preferred to change the month into something zero-based since people just want to know the name, not the number. It's a personal view.\nMoreover, there is more than a reason why one could think there is wrong with Date/Calendar:\n\n\n*\n\n*Surprising bases (1900 as the year base in Date, admittedly for deprecated constructors; 0 as the month base in both)\n\n*Mutability - using immutable types makes it much simpler to work with what are really effectively values\n\n*An insufficient set of types: it's nice to have Date and Calendar as different things, but the separation of \"local\" vs \"zoned\" values is missing, as is date/time vs date vs time\n\n*An API which leads to ugly code with magic constants, instead of clearly named methods\n\n*An API which is very hard to reason about - all the business about when things are recomputed etc\n\n*The use of parameterless constructors to default to \"now\", which leads to hard-to-test code\n\n\nA: It's the whole Inclusive or Exclusive discussion They probably used the system for counting how many months have passed.\nFor example if you say 1 month has passed, you would be in the second month of the year. So If you need a program to count how many months pass, and you are using the 1-12 system, it would report that you are in month 1 (January) not that 0 (January) months have passed , and would need to preform an extra function to determine how much time has passed.\nJust like in the thought puzzle in Chrono Trigger, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll1uAla90BU&t=13m42s , depending on how you count, if you count from the start or if you count when you finish, it can be incredibly misleading.\n\nSo for coding it is easier to start from 0 , In the diagram you count to three but in the first picture it adds up to only 2 complete cycles (months) and in the second you count to 3 but start with 0 adding up to 3 complete months.\nThis is also how everyone counts how old they are in years, you start with 0 and go to 1 once a year has passed.\nAs for why they didn't also do this for days and years. I would imagine the counting is separate for days because of the variable number of days that are in a month, this would also make it hard to count how many months have passed If you are going by the number of days. and you can get an accurate count of a passing of a year if you count how many months pass, i.e. if you count the months accurately you can count years accurately, there are 12 complete months in a year, start counting at 0 and once you hit 12 you cycle back to 0, so the numbers would be 10 11 0 1 2 3 ... like the picture below if you count to 2 then restart - \n\nAnyways, in a nutshell, the programers just did what was easiest for them.\n", "Q: I can't play games with ubuntu 12.04 I erased the entire disk to install Ubuntu 12.04 on my Acer Aspire 5750G.\nI tried Heros of Newerth, Teeworlds, and Super Tux 2.

I have heard of WINE, which emulates Windows in order to run Windows applications on Ubuntu. Is their a Windows application that would allow you to run Ubuntu applications on Windows?\n\nA: The general question to this is NO, however, there is a but:\n\n\n*\n\n*Some applications are cross-platform so you can find their Windows versions. For example, there's KDE for Windows initiative which supposedly allows you to run KDE programs on Windows\n\n*Mostly for command-line programs, there's a compatibility layer called Cygwin\n\n*you can run Ubuntu programs in a virtual machine in Windows.\nBut generally you can not take an arbitrary .deb and install and run it in Windows.\n\nA: There's also Xwindows, which would allow you to run applications from the Ubuntu server on your windows desktop. It can take a little setting up - the key is to understand that -you- are the server and the Ubuntu server is contacting you - but once it's set up I think it will do what you're looking for.\nCheck out Google for XMing, that's a classic XWindows solution.

I am setting up my developer profile on Launchpad, and would like to change my username so it would be same as other sites I use, as well as better reflect me as a person. (that's a much more important thing than it sounds)\nI want to do this now while I can, because as I understand it, once I set up a PPA it will be impossible to change it due to the username being locked into the PPA URL's to prevent breakages and other problems. \nBut when trying to change my username, it warned me with this message. \n\nChanging your name will change your public OpenID identifier.

Besides, it is too large for a comment.\nThe Ubuntu One (login.launchpad.net) profile page is utterly ridiculous. It appears that at some point in time they changed the profile names from our emails to the first part of the email. When you go to the profile page to change password, it shows the old profile name (the email), which it no longer accepts it. So if you try to change password, you come faced with the message \"you need to change profile name from launchpad\", leaving the user that wants simply to change password completely baffled as the intention was not to change profile name.\nAs @JoKalliauer mentions, you need to head to the launchpad profile page (not launchpad change password page as it redirects to the previous), see the username, fill it in the password change screen along with the new pass.\n", "Q: Terminal TTY Ctrl-Alt-F# not working, only prints junk characters I'm not sure what I pressed to mess this up.

Or is there a GTK function I should be using instead?\n(Disclaimer: I am usually more specific with my questions, I feel like this is really basic and may not even be possible and I have checked the docs. Thank you!)\n\nA: Two solutions in one! :)\nFirst, there is a special button widget just for this job: GtkLinkButton. You create a GtkLinkButton just like a normal button. Here is a simple example program written with Python and PyGObject. PyGTK should look pretty similar:\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk\nwindow = Gtk.Window()\nbutton = Gtk.LinkButton(\"http://www.google.com\", label=\"google.com\")\nwindow.add(button)\nwindow.show_all()\nGtk.main()\n\nAs an alternative, you can directly call the function gtk_show_uri.\nIf you need more sophisticated application launching stuff, take a look at Gio.\n\nA: If someone else is coming here to know how to open a URI in the default browser without using a Gtk.LinkButton, the answer is using Gtk.show_uri_on_window():\nGtk.show_uri_on_window(None, \"http://www.google.com\", Gdk.CURRENT_TIME)\n\n", "Q: Opening 2 top level windows (quickly/pygtk) Is there a way using quickly to have an appliaction have two completly seperate windows (not a window with a dialog) And be able to open each of the windows from each other and maybe even also from the command line: eg, application_name --window_title\n\nA: You can, but you'll have to create a different Window to do this, the default main window that Quickly creates is meant to run only one at a time.\n", "Q: Installation with MinimalCD: \"Couldn't download package\" I am trying to install Ubuntu Server to a VirtualBox virtual machine using the 32bit MinimalCD.

I have no experience in installing Linux based OS on MacBook, but I already have Windows installed on my Mac.

I also would like to know can I install it on my external hard drive just like installing it on a usb stick? I have viewed the how-to for installing the Lucid Lynx, is it just the same? Thanks in advance!\n\nA: To install Ubuntu n your external hard-drive live boot from your Ubuntu CD/USB. When Ubuntu boots up click on install and select the following option during the installation:\n\nIf your computer has only 1 hard-disk, then your external hard-disk will appear as sdaB  Select your external hard-drive and partition and configure it as desired.\nContinue installation as usual and Ubuntu will install on the USB Hard Drive.\n", "Q: Why is my USB data transfer so slow? Whenever I do any kind of file transfer using USB, whether to a USB stick, or with my Android phone, or anything else, it is ridiculously slow.\n\nIt says 59.8 KB/sec, which would be an awesome speed if this were 1991 and I was using a modem to dial up to my local BBS. Surely USB technology is better than that...? 37 seconds to move less data than the equivelent of 1 MP3 file?\nAlso, regardless of what it says about speed and time, the reality is much, much slower. I routinely see it say something like \"37 seconds left\" and have to wait for minutes. Sometimes, if I want to move large amounts of files, it can say it will take 8 hours or more.\nIs this normal? My computer may not be the most awesome on the market, and about a year old, but it's an i5 with 4GB RAM and modern components, so surely this isn't the hardware's fault.\nWhat can I do to get better USB data transfer performance?\nAlso, I did look at this question, but my newbie eyes don't see anything that look like an actual solution, just a lot of discussion about what transfer rates could or should be.\n\nUpdate: As requested in the comments, I've generated a whole bunch of output from the command line, and put it on Ubuntu Pastebin. Please see it here.\nI've also posted the output from lsusb -t with my Android phone connected (which is the device I am most concerned about getting reasonable speeds with).\n\nUpdate 2: As requested in the comments, I removed everything except the mouse and keyboard, and then only attached one extra device at a time for testing. Here is some output from dd:\nMy Sony video camera:\n$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/media/disk/testfile bs=128k count=800 conv=fdatasync\n800+0 records in\n800+0 records out\n104857600 bytes (105 MB) copied, 6.00824 s, 17.5 MB/s\n\nMy Android phone:\n$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/media/C3AD-13DC/testfile bs=128k count=800 conv=fdatasync\n800+0 records in\n800+0 records out\n104857600 bytes (105 MB) copied, 52.357 s, 2.0 MB/s\n\nThe camera performed much better than usual, and while the phone wasn't as bad as it has been (about twice as fast as I've ever seen), it's still significantly slower than the camera.\n\nA: After all the diagnostics Dave, this certainly looks like a problem being caused by your hub(s) -- first of all, the USB 1.1 external hub you're using, and possibly one of the internal chips on your motherboard used to provide physical USB ports.\n\n\n*\n\n*17.5 Mbytes/sec to your Sony Video Camera's flash memory is close to the practical throughput limits of USB 2.0; the 2.0 Mbytes/sec with your Android phone may just be because its flash doesn't support faster writes.\n\n*Your motherboard is a Foxconn P55MX, as this clue from dmesg on line 1308 of your paste tells us: DMI: ThirdWave Corporation Prime Series/P55MX Series, BIOS 080015  09/15/2009\n\n*The Intel P55 chipset contains two USB 2.0 controllers (or root hubs), providing up to 8 and 6 ports respectively:\n\n|__ Port 1: Dev 2, If 0, Class=hub, Driver=hub/8p, 480M\n|__ Port 1: Dev 2, If 0, Class=hub, Driver=hub/6p, 480M\n\n\n*One big problem is this external hub to which you have your mouse/keyboard/tablet connected; it looks like a USB 1.1 hub (or a poorly designed USB 2.0 hub). Connecting the 1.1 hub forces that root hub to downgrade all its ports to USB 1.1 speeds. A USB 2.0 hub contains translators which prevent this behavior:\n        |__ Port 4: Dev 8, If 0, Class=hub, Driver=hub/4p, 12M\n\n*The btusb is just a Bluetooth dongle you plugged in.\n\n\nAnyway, it appears the intermittent problem is caused when something forces the root hub to downgrade all ports to USB 1.0/USB 1.1 speeds -- 60 kbytes/sec is close to real-world USB 1.0 speeds IIRC!\nNow, replacing your external hub with a proper USB 2.0 one should fix these problems; if not, something may be wrong with the actual Intel chip on the motherboard or its connection to the physical ports, and you may have to have it replaced under warranty.\n\nA: \nSomething very strange has happened. I booted to a live CD to see if\n  the USB speeds were different. With the Live CD, it was much faster.\n  Something around 4MB/s. I thought this was evidence that there was a\n  configuration problem in my regular install. However, I rebooted back\n  to my installed system, tried a test transfer one more time to be\n  sure, but the speed is now exactly the same as it was with the Live\n  CD. Could something have changed by using the LiveCD? That seems\n  unlikely, but I tested before the Live CD, and it was definitely\n  slower before... so this is very odd.\n\nJudging by this, you are clearly suffering from either A) faulty hardware or B) a faulty USB driver\nIf you have other similar USB ports that work well on your system, then it is very likely just faulty hardware with that single port.\n", "Q: Thunderbird font size varies with encoding in Content-Type header I can't get Thunderbird 13.0.1 to use proper font sizes for message text.\nI have configured all font settings to use Ubuntu Mono 16, and set minimum font size to 16. Nevertheless, I get two different font sizes for message bodies depending on the encoding specified in the Content-Type header, both of them wrong.\nWhen the encoding is omitted, or when it is set to iso-8859-1 or us-ascii the message is displayed using a font that seems to be of size 12 or 13. This font size is also used when composing new messages. When increasing the configured font size, the displayed text increases size and seems to stay about 3 or 4 units below the one I set.\nWhen the encoding is set to utf-8, the message is displayed using a very tiny font, size 8 or 9. This is close to unreadable. The font size used for such messages are constant, and does not change when I modify the configuration for fonts or minimum font size.\nI had similar problems with earlier versions of Thunderbird, but it has gotten a lot worse after the last update, with the  font size for utf-8 messages refusing to increase above the unreadable.\nIs there any way to circumvent this annoying problem?\n\nA: After some searching on the net, I found the solution to my own problem. I include a description of it below to hopefully save others with the same problem some effort:\nAt the top of the dialog window under Edit > Preferences > Display > Formatting > Fonts > Advanced,\nthere is a drop-down menu labelled Fonts for. This is initially set to Western, meaning all settings below only applies to messages with those encodings.

It also makes no difference if I use a WiFi or network cable connection.\nWhat could be my issue?\n\nA speed test (www.speedtest.net) comes out at about 0.9 Mbps down and 0.42 Mbps up (which is a shade under the advertised line speed), I reside in South Africa and use the UCT LEG server.

I know Google's repo takes several minutes to respond here sometimes. If you have third party repos set up, open Update Manager, click Settings, then the \"Other Software\" tab.

Everything worked once I updated my network interface's DNS config. :)\n\nA: Sometimes, all you need to do is just switch to the main server for updates. Updates, depending on your geographical area, sometimes don't come from the main servers for faster deliveries.\nFor whatever reasons, the relay servers might not be responding as quick as possible to certain requests, so temporarily switching to Main Server for updates should fix it.\nWhen you open your Software and Updates, select \"Main Server\" from the Download From option.\nYou should be good to go. Switching to main server always works for me. :)\n\nA: Just go to System setting->Software & Updates and switch a server works fine for me. I guess my last selected server broke down for unknown reasons.\n\nA: If the issue still persists, I would recommend try a different internet source. Few ISPs block network and network ranges.

If I enter the name of my project he tells me that there is no project.\n\nA: To be able to upload your project to launchpad, you must have the SSH key of your computer recognized by your launchpad account, a ppa set up for your project, your openPGP key recognized by launchpad, and then you must run quickly share or quickly release. It should connect to launchpad, allow you to specify the ppa where you wish to upload, then upload it. I had problems similar to yours yesterday, then I found out I had to make launchpad recognize my computer.\n\nA: Go to https://launchpad.net/projects/+new and register your project. After that run \"quickly submitubuntu\"\n\nA: I think that quickly submitubuntu is a command to submit an application, not to get it. To get an application which is on launchpad, you need to go on the project page, and download the debian package of the project.\n\nA: First, you have to register your own project on launchpad. Do this here.\nYou have to setup a SSH key and sign it. You can do this on your launchpad home screen.\nWhen your application is registered, you can start uploading the app. Do this with\nquickly submitubuntu\n\nNow you can specify your project and start submitting.\n", "Q: How to get Multimedia keys working at my ASUS N56VZ Ubuntu 12.04 Notebook I don't get my multimedia keys (FN Keys) working. The Notebook is a ASUS N56VZ.\nIf I normally press the multimedia key combinations, nothing happens. If I try to get the keycodes while pressing, for e. g., Fn+F8 (this should turn volume up) with xev or acpi_listen started, there is no output at all.\nOnly the Fn+F1 (Standby) and the Fn+F2 (Wireless on/off) combinations are working, but also, there is no output at xev or acpi_listen, while doing this.\nWhat can I do here?\n\nA: I also have an Asus N56VZ.\nGood news, you can have nearly all the Fn keys to work (all except the screen backlight control keys, don't know why)\nBad news, for the moment, you will have to wait for kernel 3.5 release or to modify source code according to what you can see here if you cannot wait.\nUPDATE 11/19/2012\nGood news, most of the Fn keys work out of the box since Ubuntu 12.10.\nAnother good news ! For the reluctant screen backlight control keys (F5 and F6), I have found this procedure. It originaly has been written for the Asus Zenbook Prime, but it works like a charm with the N56VZ.\nUPDATE 04/07/2013\nI recently upgraded my firmware to version 2.16. Unluckily, the fixasusbacklight workaround seems inefficient with this version. The screen backlight Fn+F5/F6 keys are no longer working. Anyway, this situation should be fixed by the end of the month with the release of Ubuntu 13.04. I have just tested the beta Live CD and everything works fine with it. \n\nA: According to Asus, this maybe an issue with the BIOS.  They also said that according to responses from the BIOS team, the calling method of wmi evaluate method, returns ASUS_WMI_UNSUPPORTED_METHOD in new ASUS laptop PCs. This patch fixes it.1 \nAs fossfreedom said, there are a couple of recent BIOS updates for your laptop.  You need to make sure that your BIOS is up to date before attempting this fix. \nI shared this file on dropbox, because I couldn't find it anywhere that doesn't require you to have a user name and a password.  \nSo first you need to download the file asus-wmi-dkms_0.2_all.deb.  Once you do that, just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, navigate to the folder where the file got downloaded, probably the Downloads folder, and then run the commands below.\nsudo apt-get install dkms\nsudo dpkg -i asus-wmi-dkms_0.2_all.deb\n\nI hope that this works for you.\nClick here to download the file\n1Source:Asus VIP Tech Support\nP.S. Let me know if this works.  Because if it doesn't I need to let Asus VIP support know.  Thanks\n\nA: I have an ASUS N56VZ too.\nTo get the Fn Key to work I installed the kernel 3.5.3, everything but the Screen Brightness works perfectly. I'm pretty sure a kernel update is not necessary, if you update the module asus_wb_wmi will be enough I guess.\nOther thing that is working now with this kernel is the Wifi led that wasn't working before.\n\nA: It appears the function, multimedia keys are software routed; with the exception of the power functions, standby and wifi power. \nIF you want those function shortcuts, you would have to manually create them in KB preferences: because they are not native extensions. \nFor example: My keyboard has completely seperate shortcut keys (its an old HP i found) and theres a button called \"Shopping\" that is a serperate code, and unmapped. So i set it to terminal.\nIf you go into keyboard settings -> Shortcuts tab: Does it let you map \"Function + Fx\" ?\n\nA: Try to edit your Keyboard Shortcuts, as all of the multimedia functions listed above are available for input.\nGo to System Settings, Keyboard, then click the Shortcuts tab. The functions that you are looking for are in the Sound and Media section, but you may also find some useful functions worth changing in other sections as well.\n\nA: I have an Asus N53SM, and all my FN+F* keys show up as making a keycode in xev. Make sure you have the xev window selected while you are testing out the keys. If your keys aren't producing a keycode, then there is no way for the XWindows system to know when they are pressed.\n\nA: I have an N56VJ and the last kernel update to 3.7.0.4 finally has the screen backlight f6, F7 working.  They are generating events in xev and I get the slider display at upper right. It will not change the brightness much though, the slider will only move down to about 90 percent. Is there a way to change the range?\n", "Q: What does Ctrl + Alt + F11 do and why can't I log into my account with Unity any more? I was just happily typing away, trying out some Android development on my Ubuntu machine. I pressed Ctrl + Alt + F11 instead of Ctrl + F11 to run the program in Eclipse.\nThis made the screen go blank with a white flashing cursor and it stayed like that for a while, so I pressed Ctrl + Alt + F4 to get to a terminal I could use and remembered seeing somewhere startx to start the GUI again, so I tried that and had something I have also been trying commands like unity, unity start and unity restart, but they all seem to run, but I never get my GUI back.\nThe fact that it only happened to my user account is strange. If I use guest I can access the GUI, but if I try and log in to my account the screen goes black for a few seconds and then sends be back to the log in screen.\nI have tried installing the Xubuntu desktop over the top of it, but it does the same thing with that desktop as well.\nMy knowledge of Linux is starting to get stretched at this point now.\nWhat may have happened and how do I put it right? Maybe it's a user setting or something I could change?\nAlso could anyone tell me what Ctrl + Alt and F11 does?\nI'm using the latest version of Ubuntu and ran the latest updates today as well.\nWhen running startx, I get an error saying:\n\nFatal Server error@ server is already active for display 0 if this server is no longer running, remove /temp/.x0-lock and start again\n\nAnother thing I have tried is using Ctrl + Alt + F7 to bring back the GUI, but that doesn't seem to help either. It always sends me back to the log in screen (which is the GUI log in screen).\n\nA: Ctrl+Alt+F7 or Ctrl+Alt+F8 should find your GUI again.\nThe Ctrl+Alt+F# buttons bring up \"TTYs\" which are just terminal interfaces you can use without running gnome-terminal or another terminal program.\n\nA: Ctrl+Alt+F11 sort of puts the GUI to sleep, and puts you into a virtual terminal mode, something like the old fashion ttys.\nOnce in this mode you can choose between 6 different tty input screens. Each acting like it is an old-fashion tty.  The different ttys can be chosen with Alt+F1 up to Alt+F7.  Each of these virtual ttys will require that you log in with the old fashion Unix login that you would use from an old-fashion tty.\nIf you login to one of these and then try to restart the X-window server it won't let you because there is already a server running.\nIf you are in this virtual terminal mode you can use Alt+F1 through Alt+F6 to switch between the 6 different tty-like inputs.  Each will look just the way you left it when you switched out.  You can also use Alt+F7 to switch to the screen (not a tty) that is attached to the already running GUI.\nNote there is a difference between Ctrl+Alt+ and just Alt+.\nThis mode is actually very useful if you are in something using full screen mode and you need access to a backend command shell.\n", "Q: Change desktop background from Terminal I need to change the background of my desktop in Ubuntu 12. 04 with a command in terminal, in order to make a script with bash.

I see juju creates a new security group when we do a bootstrap, but this security group is so open that it allows all the machine inside the group to access all the ports.\nIs it possible to create a restricted security group or is there an option/parameter in environment.yaml file to specify that?\n\nA: I found a way to do it\nThis can be solved by creating a security group earlier ( with whatever security policy we wish), so that juju can use the same security instead of creating one.\nSecurity group name should match the name that we specify in the environment.yaml file. For example , if we use the name \"amazon\", then the security group name should be \"juju-amazon\".\nAs zookeeper service ( bootstrap instance) is listening on the port 2181 for all the client request , we need to open 2181 port for the group.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 freezes during install on Compaq Presario V2000 I am trying to upgrade an older Compaq Presario V2000 from Ubuntu 10.04 to 12.04.  I had no problems installing 10.04, but I'm having some issues with the 12.04 install freezing.  I downloaded the file from the website and made a bootable CD.  When I boot up the computer to start the install, it shows the Ubuntu logo and then eventually freezes on the logo.  I re-downloaded the file again and made a startup disk with a USB jump drive instead. It also freezes on boot up of the 12.04 installation in the same spot.

When I was using Ubuntu 11.10 I did never have any error messages. Can I somehow post a error report (and how do I find it) here so one can figure out what the reason for the errors is.\n\nA: This is a bug with Ubuntu's error-reporting utility called Apport that a lot of people are experiencing. There is not currently a fix, but you can disable Apport so that it will not keep popping up. \nTo do this run   \ngksudo gedit /etc/apport.conf\n\nAfter you enter in your password, Gedit will open up. \nYou need to change the \nenabled=1line toenabled=0`\nThen, save the file and close Gedit.

However, if you click on the up/down arrow in the info bar at the top of the screen.. Then \"Edit Connections\" - Wireless. You should have a wireless connection entry in the list. If not, you will need to add one. In the settings box for the wireless connection, the second box down is labelled \"Mode\". This should be on \"Ad-hoc\" not on \"Infrastructure\".\nIf it is already set to Ad-hoc, make sure that the SSID is correct. If the Band is set to auto, try the correct band for your desktop PC, also check that the Channel is set to the same as your desktop. On the security tab, change the security to match your desktop; Win7 defaults to WPA2-Personal. Make sure that you've entered the key correctly. On the IPv4 tab, try manually setting the IP details. Choose an unused IP address on the same network as your desktop. For example, if the desktop has an IP of 10.0.0.1 associated with the Wireless network, the \"mask\" will be 255.255.255.0 by default so you must choose an address of 10.0.0.2 - 10.0.0.254, make the gateway the IP address of the desktop (e.g. 10.0.0.1 in this example).\n\nA: I am running Ubuntu 12.10 and at first I couldn't connect to my friends Windows 7 Ad Hoc with the default settings that Ubuntu used.

How can I Install Skype without ia32-libs?\nThe libraries provided by ia32-libs crash my 64-bit \"Second Life\" game.\n\nA: You could unpack the 32bit libraries manually into some directory where SecondLife doesn't find them, and then use LD_LIBRARY_PATH to hopefully let skype find them. Try it on the console, and if it works, create some wrapper script which executes skype with a suitable environment.\nAs I don't usually use graphical package managers, I'm not sure which of the following approaches is better suited:\n\n\n*\n\n*Using a package manager:\n\n*\n\n*Install ia32-libs-multiarch with all its dependencies\n\n*Copy the content of /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/ to /usr/my32bit\n\n*Use the package manager to remove the packages installed above. This might be the tricky part, due to the large number of auto-selected dependencies.\n\n\n*Manual unpacking\n\n*\n\n*Look at the ia32-libs-multiarch package description page\n\n*Follow each link to each dependency\n\n*Click on the architecture i386 to download a .deb file for it\n\n*mkdir xDir, a new directory to unpack stuff\n\n*Unpack each using dpkg-deb -x foo.deb xDir\n\n*Copy xDir/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/ to /usr/my32bit\nIn either case, you should end up with those libraries copied to /usr/my32bit. You will have to manually install skype as well, unless you find a way to circumwent the dependency check during installation. The steps from the second approach above will wokr there, too. You might need to install it to its proper locations, so that skype itself will find all its components. So instead of xDir you would have to specify /. I'll take no guarantees if that should mess up your system, so perhaps you should install into a safe directory first, to see what gets installed and if that will overwrite anything. Then you could execute\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/my32bit skype\n\nIf that works, you can create a file /usr/local/skype to contain this:\n#!/bin/sh\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/my32bit\nexec /usr/bin/skype\n\nMake that script executable using chmod +x /usr/local/skype. If your desktop icons fail to execute that script, they might contain an absolute path. Edit any .desktop file included in the skype .deb package, and adjust its path to the local one. Or rename /usr/bin/skype to /usr/bin/skype.real, place the script in the original location and have it call the real binary.\n\nA: You could run 32 bit programs like skype in a 32-bit OS under Virtualbox. The 64-bit OS and software wouldn't know about it.  That's what I've decided to try after ia32-libs-multiarch screwed up Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit OS. I've almost got the 32 bit version of 12.04 running with eclipse and Android SDK. It's a pain. But at least the 64-bit system will never get corrupted. Plus you can make many virtual systems and check out new installations and go backwards when they fail. Much easier than reinstalling everything like I just had to do.\n\nA: The ia32-libs are a dependency for Skype.\nYou can't install Skype without them, and even if you manage to install Skype without them, Skype won't work properly without the required dependencies.\n", "Q: How to add the kill button in xfce4-panel 4.10.0 of Xubuntu 12.10?

Is this a bug or did I accidentally modify my setup somehow?\nThanks!\nEDIT: I should mention that I have deleted the .byobu folder, but to no avail. \n\nA: From your description, you're using byobu with the GNU Screen backend, where \"splits\" are not really handled very well.\nByobu's tmux backend provides a much better experience when trying splits.\nYou can switch your backend by running:\nbyobu-select-backend\n\nOr you can manually launch with either backend, using byobu-tmux or byobu-screen.\nFull disclosure: I am the author and maintainer of Byobu.\n\nA: Here is a quick cheat sheet for working with splits in Byobu:\n\n\n*\n\n*C-a + Tab - Cycle split windows\n\n*C-a + C - Create new tab\n\n*C-a + {Number} - Select the tab number for the active split window.\n\n", "Q: HD flash video lagging on LG R400 I'm installing Ubuntu on my friends laptop.

I was now asked to download the required files from \"Install New Software\" in the IDE itself where it asks me to accept the User's Licence Agreement. I click on the radio button which says that I'm accepting the agreement but the finish button doesn't get highlighted and I'm unable to click it! \nAny Solutions?\n\nA: It works.  Depending on what you're installing, you might have to:  \n\n\n*\n\n*Accept multiple license agreements (accept each and click next).  \n\n*Toggle to accept all and accept all the agreements at once.  \n\n\nWhat @rafal said was right.  In some cases you need to scroll to the bottom of the window.  \nIf none of this solves the problem, add a screenshot to your question so we can \"see\" your window.\n\nA: for my case, Eclipse indigo / juno, Ubuntu 12.04, virtual box operating system, any reinstall or update or install other version of eclipse or close/restart do not work, and toot me more than 3 hrs....

However, in Ubuntu, it isn't possible to drag a file onto the list of startup applications so that it runs at startup. Is there another way to make a file open at startup, using the default program for opening that file?\n\nA: I assume that you use Unity, however the process is quite similar with other Desktop Environments aswell.\nOpen the Dash and search for:\nstartup application\n\nClick add and specify the command you'd like to use. You can then use two approaches, either you open the file by selecting the application you'd like to start with the file as an parameter, or you can use xdg-open as mentioned in this askubuntu-thread:\nxdg-open [/path/]filename\n\n\nA: You may drag files to be executed at startup into ~/.config/autostart\nHowever, they must be shortcuts (*.desktop files)\nIf you want to start scripts or documents,\nput them in subfolders scripts and documents that you create inside autostart\nand create the following shortcuts in autostart:\nscripts.desktop:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Scripts in 'scripts' folder\nExec=/bin/bash -c 'for f in ~/.config/autostart/scripts/*; do eval \"$f&\"; done'\nType=Application\n\ndocuments.desktop:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Documents in 'documents' folder\nExec=/bin/bash -c 'for f in ~/.config/autostart/documents/*; do eval \"xdg-open $f&\"; done'\nType=Application\n\nUbuntu ought to be bright enough to allow any .desktop, script, executable or document file to be put in autostart and execute it appropriately.\n\nA: To open a file at startup using the default application, add this terminal command to the list of startup applications:\nxdg-open (file path, without parentheses)\n", "Q: Run a script only at the very first boot Is there an idiomatic way in Ubuntu to run a script only the first time a machine is booted?

If the file already exists, exit the script. \n\nA: In my case, it was building a custom system and I had to refuse to use cloud-init and placing a script under /etc/init.d/script didn't work - so I used systemd.\nFILE  /etc/systemd/system/firstboot.service\n[Unit]\nDescription=One time boot script\n[Service]\nType=simple\nExecStart=/firstboot.sh\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target \n\nand\nFILE /firstboot.sh\n#!/bin/bash \nSOME COMMANDS YOU WANT TO EXECUTE\nsystemctl disable firstboot.service \nrm -f /etc/systemd/system/firstboot.service\nrm -f /firstboot.sh\n\nThen enable\nsudo chmod +x /firstboot.sh\nsudo systemctl enable firstboot.service\n\nThis one works just fine for me.\n\nA: I'm surprised at the results I'm seeing for searching for a well-defined and supported Ubuntu \"first boot\" hook.  Seems like the Red Hat / Fedora / CentOS crowd has had this nailed for over a decade.  The closest Ubuntu equivalent seems to be oem-config-firstboot.\nThe idea of simply performing an rm $0 will work.  But, technically there are some interesting semantics involved.  Unlike most other script interpreters under Unix a shell script is read and processed one line/statement at a time.  If you unlink (rm) the file out from under it then that the instance of the shell that's processing that script is now working with an anonymous file (any file that's open but unlinked).\nConsider a file like this:\n#!/bin/bash\nrm $0\necho \"I've removed myself: $0\"\nls -l $0\ncat <<COMMENTARY\n   This is a test.\n   I'm still here, because the \"here\" doc is being fed to 'cat'\n   via the anonymous file through the open file descriptor.\n   But I cannot be re-exec'd\nCOMMENTARY\nexec $0\n\nIf you save that to something like rmself.sh and (hard) link that to something like tst then running ./tst should show something like this as output:\n$ ./tst \nI've removed myself: ./tst\nls: ./tst: No such file or directory\n   This is a test.\n   I'm still here, because the \"here\" doc is being fed to 'cat'\n   via the anonymous file through the open file descriptor.\n   But I cannot be re-exec'd\n./tst: line 11: /home/jimd/bin/tst: No such file or directory\n./tst: line 11: exec: /home/jimd/bin/tst: cannot execute: No such file or directory\n\nNow there are some odd possible corner cases with regards to symlinks and cases where the script was invoked as a bare name (forcing the shell to search the $PATH for the script.\nBut it seems that bash (at least in version 3.2) prepends $0 with the path if it searched the path and otherwise leaves $0 set to whatever relative or absolute path was used to invoke the script.  It doesn't seem to do any normalization or resolution relative paths nor symlinks.\nProbably the cleanest \"firstboot\" for Ubuntu would be to create a small package (.deb) containing a script to be placed in /etc/init.d/firstboot and a post-install script that uses update-rc.d to link that into runlevel 1 (/etc/rc1.d) (using a command like: update-rc.d firstboot defaults) ... and then have the last line perform a deactivation or delete using something like: update-rc.d firstboot disable\nHere's a link to the Debian update-rc.d HOWTO\n\nA: The question was about running a script at first boot of EC2.\nYou can use cloud-init for this purpose.\nWhen launching a new EC2 instance you have an option to define User data under Advanced datails. If you place cloud-init script there, it will be executed at first boot only.\nFor example you can place the following in User data:\n#cloud-config\n\nruncmd:\n  - /usr/bin/command1.sh\n  - /usr/bin/command2.sh\n\nThe output will be written to /var/log/cloud-init-output.log\nCloud-init can do much more than this. It is designed especially to perform early initialization of cloud instances. See the docs here: http://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html\n\nA: No. But you might want to place your script in /etc/init.d/script, and self-delete it:\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho \"Bump! I'm your first-boot script.\"\n\n# Delete me\nrm $0\n\n\nA: Combining the first two answers\nAssuming you name your script /usr/local/bin/firstboot.sh put it at the end of /etc/rc.local (this scripts runs on every boot) the scripts goes like this\nUpdate 2022: Put the script in crontab like this\n@reboot /usr/local/bin/firstboot.sh\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nFLAG=\"/var/log/firstboot.log\"\nif [[ ! -f $FLAG ]]; then\n   #Put here your initialization sentences\n   echo \"This is the first boot\"\n   \n   #the next line creates an empty file so it won't run the next boot\n   touch \"$FLAG\"\nelse\n   echo \"Do nothing\"\nfi\n\n\nA: You can backup current rc.local to rc.local.bak\nThen you can have the stuff you want to do in rc.local and at the end just mv /etc/rc.loca.bak /etc/rc.local.\n", "Q: Why doesn't thunderbird appear in the application switcher?

How can I get this to work?\n\nA: if [ \"$(which gimp)\" != \"\"]\n\n] must be the [ command's last argument, and it must be a separate argument, hence you need a space before it. See Bash Pitfall 10.\nBut, don't use which. It is a non-standard, external command that looks for a file in PATH. It behaves differently on different systems, and you can't really rely on a useful output or exit status. The shell already provides better ways of checking if a command exists and will work consistently on any system, so better learn those. See Bash FAQ 81. In this case though, you don't need to test if gimp exists, just running gimp -version, or querying dpkg about the version of the gimp package (see dpkg-query(1)), will already tell you whether it exists or not. \nif [ \"$(gimp -version)\" != 2.8 ]\n\nAndAC already gave a solution for this one, but I'll provide another one; comparing the version numbers. dpkg provides a way to compare two versions, namely dpkg --compare-versions ver1 op ver2. E.g. dpkg --compare-versions 2.6.12 '<' 2.8.0-1ubuntu0ppa6~precise will return true since version 2.6.12 is older than 2.8.0-1ubuntu0ppa6~precise. See dpkg(1).\nAll the brackets ({ and }) in that script are pointless, they serve no purpose, so you might as well remove them.\nPutting this all together:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\n# Query dpkg to get the version of the currently installed gimp package.\n# The command returns false if the package is not installed.\nif version=$(dpkg-query -W -f='${Version}' gimp 2>/dev/null); then \n\n    # Check if it's older than 2.8\n    if dpkg --compare-versions \"$version\" '<' 2.8; then\n        apt-get remove gimp || exit\n    else\n        printf 'Looks good.\\n'\n        exit\n    fi\nfi\n\nadd-apt-repository ppa:otto-kesselgulasch/gimp &&\napt-get update &&\napt-get install gimp\n\n\nA: First line, \"which\" is low-case:\nif [ \"$(which gimp)\" != \"\"]\n\nHere:\nif [ \"$(gimp -version)\" != 2.8 ]\n\nYou can use:\ngimp_ver=$(gimp -version)\ngimp_ver=$(echo ${gimp_ver##* } | cut -f1-2 -d'.')\nif [ $gimp_ver != \"2.8\" ]\n\n\nA: Instead of capturing the output and seeing if it's empty\nif [ \"$(which gimp)\" != \"\"] \n\nuse this, which just considers the command's exit status (0 = success)\nif which gimp &>/dev/null\nthen \n\nYour use of braces to group commands is not necessary, but will not hurt.\n\nA: Since there is no information about what goes wrong it it is hard to help. But at the very least, you should fix the mis-spelling of \"which\", you have written it with a capital W and bash is case sensitive.\n\nA: A few technical observations and concerns you'll run into:\n\n\n*\n\n*Everything that @AndAC has said.\n\n*add-apt-repository may not be installed on everyone's system.  On clean installations I've seen, 12.04 includes it by default but older ones do not.  You may want a stop at the beginning to doif [ \"$(which add-apt-repository)\" != \"\"]\nand in instances where it does not exist, force installation of the parent package as a dependency before continuing on in the script (note: omit sudo if you take the third bullet point in this list as part of your script): sudo apt-get install python-software-properties\n\n*You may want to utilize the methods described here to require your entire script to run as super user.  And I say this because on some systems, there is sudoers policy to require a passcode for each and every instance of the use of sudo.  I have a few scripts that needed that, and by adding in the information in the answer I linked, you can partially avoid that problem by requiring that you run the script as superuser (via sudo).\n\n", "Q: How to change user account settings with lxde How can I change my user account settings using ubuntu 12.04 and lxde?

Is there any way to set up minimum passcode requirements, such as a minimum length, requirement of mixed case alphanumerics and at least 1 symbol in the passcode, and enforce that at passcode changes?\n\nA: Password complexity in Ubuntu is controlled by PAM. Unfortunately, PAM is \"typically Unix\" like in its approach. Meaning that it spreads its configuration through a large number of very confusing files.\nThe file that controls password complexity is:\n/etc/pam.d/common-password\n\nThere is a line:\npassword [success=1 default=ignore] pam_unix.so obscure sha512\n\nWhich defines the basic rules for password complexity. You can add a minimum length override by changing it to:\npassword [success=1 default=ignore] pam_unix.so obscure sha512 minlen=12\n\nor whatever minimum you want. As you can see, the default already defines some basic obscurity rules. These basic rules can be seen in:\nman pam_unix\n\nSearch for \"obscure\".\nThere are a large number of pam modules that can be installed.\napt-cache search libpam-\n\nShould show you them.\nYou will need to hunt down the documenation for them I'm afraid. But the \"cracklib\" is a common addition.\nUPDATE: I should have pointed out that the default \"obscure\" parameter includes tests for complexity based on previous passwords and simplicity (length, number of different types of character). The example in the manpage shows cracklib in action. Install libpam_cracklib to get that working.\nAlso, once you have worked out what to change, the changes are the same in other files so that you can enforce the same (or different) password checks for SSH and other applications.\n\nA: Pre-installed PAM modules allow you to set up basic requirements within the light of complexity. There is a nice module which is a successor of pam_cracklib module - pam_pwquality. In order to install it type the following\napt-get install libpam-pwquality\n\nthen get familiar with this one\nman pam_pwquality\n\nespecially with the \"Options\" section. \nNow you can edit the common-password in /etc/pam.d/\nvi /etc/pam.d/common-password\n\nfind the line which contains the following \"password        requisite                       pam_pwquality.so\" statement and after pam_pwquality.so attach your options like this\npassword        requisite         pam_pwquality.so minlen=16 ucredit=-4 retry=3\n\nwhich stands for \"the minimum size of password is 16 characters, where minimum 4 of them a uppercase. Prompt user for password 3 times.\npam_pwquality allows you make much more complex password requirements in combination with other modules like pam_pwhistory. Good luck\n\nA: Password values are controlled in the file \n/etc/pam.d/common-password\n\nFor more information on how to modify the file see pam_unix manpage \n", "Q: How can I move a terminal screen from one workspace to another? I tried to drag a terminal screen from one workspace to another, and it didn't work.\n\nA: From the keyboard you can use Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Right/Left/Down/Up depending on which direction you want to move it to. To do it graphically select the workspace switcher in the Launcher (or press Super+s) and drag it from workspace to workspace while in that view.

It's a standard printer protocol based on HTTP, allowing you all ways to profit from port forwarding, tunneling etc. The configuration is very easy and this way is less error-prone than using Samba. IPP is natively supported by Windows since Windows 2000.\nTo configure the server side you need to enable browsing in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf, by adding the line \"BrowesAllow all\":\n Browsing On\n BrowseOrder allow,deny\n BrowseAllow @LOCAL\n BrowseAllow all\n\nOn the Windows computer, go to the printer control panel and choose to 'Add a New Printer'. Next, choose to give a URL. For the URL, type in the location of the printer: http://host_ip_address:631/printers/printer_name (where host_ip_address is the GNU/Linux server's IP address and printer_name is the name of the printer being connected to).\nAfter this, install the native printer drivers for your printer on the Windows computer. If the CUPS server is set up to use its own printer drivers, then you can just select a generic postscript printer for the Windows client(e.g. 'HP Color LaserJet 8500 PS' or 'Xerox DocuTech 135 PS2'). Then test the print setup by printing a test page.\n\n*If you must use Samba to share, you could adding a write list to smb.conf:\n[printers]\ncomment = All Printers\npath = /var/spool/samba\nbrowseable = yes\nguest ok = no\nprintable = yes\ncreate mode=0700\nwrite list=@adm root <username>\n\nAll of the above info I found at this wiki, which has more info then what I included here.

With 3 monitors on 2 GPUs, using Twinview is not an option. Xinerama allows me to drag windows between all monitors, but it also means that I lose all hardware acceleration.\nI don't expect to be able to drag windows between the screens and have them occupy two monitors simultaneously, but there must be some way to transfer a program while it is running. At the moment, I don't even know how to select which monitor it will use when launched.\nAny pointers?\n\nA: If you are using multiple X screens (i.e. you have displays :0.0, :0.1, etc), then it is not possible to move windows between them.  Windows are bound to an X screen because the screens might have incompatible pixel formats or the hardware might not be able to share resources between the screens.  Xinerama, RandR and TwinView were all designed to work around this by merging multiple monitors into a single logical screen.\nI know Sun put work into Gnome 2.x to make sure it worked well in this configuration and applications launched from a panel of a one screen would cause the application to open on the same screen, but it is possible some of this has bitrotted since then if you're having trouble.\nSome applications (like Nautilus) should be multi-screen capable out of the box, but most will only run on a single screen at once.  You can force an application to launch on a particular X screen by passing a custom display string.  For example, to launch Firefox on the second screen you could run the following:\nfirefox --display :0.1\n\nPerhaps creating a few custom launchers with commands like this would help?\n", "Q: which graphics card to use multiple monitors with multiple workspace Currently I use core i5 system 2320 @ 3.0GHz with x86-64 bit architecture using Ubuntu 12.04.

This seems odd to me. I can't install software using the \"friendly\" GUI tool unless I input the root password but by default, my Ubuntu 12.04 has root disabled with no password set.\nWhy doesn't Software Centre use a SUDO credential? Perhaps using gksudo?\n\nA: I have never seen Ubuntu Software Center ask for a root password. It's not supposed to, and it won't happen unless you do something special to your system. What is supposed to happen, is that it uses Policy Kit, which will ask you to select a user and enter a password for that user. \nPolicyKit is much more suitable for this than gksudo, since sudo will allow access to commands, whereas PolicyKit allows access to actions such as org.debian.apt.install-or-remove-packages. If instead you provided access to run apt-get, then you could do anything apt-get can do, which is way too much power. You might, for instance, grant permission for all users to install security upgrades from official Ubuntu archives, but not allow the user to install new software. That wouldn't be possible to do with sudo. \nI would check to see if you've removed the package policykit-1-gnome.\n\nA: This happens (at least on 14.04 which I've just tested on) when there are no users in the \"sudo\" group.\nIt doesn't matter if your user is explicitly listed in the /etc/sudoers file or not as to this behaviour -- it looks for members of the sudo group and requests a password for one of those users.  If there are no members in that group then it requests the root password, which may not be enabled at all.\nEdit: This is probably because the sudoers file is unreadable by normal users, but the list of members in the sudo group *is* possible to access.\n", "Q: Script runs when I type it into a terminal, but not when I run it from a .sh file I wanted to run this at start-up because I like to play around with multiple DEs.

Answers to my previous question, Ubuntu 12.04 froze, requiring powercycle. What should I look / grep for in the logs?, have led me to suspect that my computer is experiencing an intermittent GPU lockup. It has been happening about once a week, usually when I am using Chrome. Today it happened when I was creating a diagram on lucidchart\nI have a Dell Optiplex 755 with an ATI Radeon HD 2400 XT and dual monitors running in Xinerama mode. I am using 12.04 with the proprietary ATI driver installed.\nWhen the computer locks-up, I can still ssh in. And I would like to follow the instructions on reporting this provided at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/Freeze\nIs there a (safe) way to cause a GPU lockup so that I can go ahead and file a bug, rather than waiting until it happens again?\n\nA: Excellent question.\nWorkloads\nThe /usr/share/xdiagnose/workloads directory has a set of workloads designed to exercise your graphics system to trigger lockups.\n$ ls /usr/share/xdiagnose/workloads/\nREADME                       do_monitor_rotation_loop\ndo_chws_loop*                do_screensaver_loop*\ndo_cpu_spin_loop             do_video_loop*\ndo_disk_write_loop           do_vtswitch_loop*\ndo_glx_loop*                 repro.sh\ndo_kernel_compile_loop       run_workloads\ndo_monitor_disable_loop*     youtube-loop.html\ndo_monitor_resolution_loop*  youtube-reload.html\n\nNote that to run them you need to pass 'run'.  E.g.:\n$ do_glx_loop run\nWith no args the scripts will display usage.  Partly that's for safety (in case people just blindly run the scripts), but mostly it's to keep the scripts' API tidy.\nThe ones I've starred are probably the best ones to start with.  I would start by running just one script at a time and let it go a few hours.  If your system survives that well enough, then try running two or more simultaneously.\nNote I haven't tested these super heavily myself, so can't promise they're bug free.  But they're quite short and simple scripts so hopefully easy to fix up, and well patches are very much welcomed.\nAlso note that they quite likely may trigger lockups unrelated to the one you're trying to solve.  GPU lockups all generally look identical to the untrained eye since they have the exact same symptoms, more or less.\nLogs\nIf you're on Intel Graphics, there is a /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/i915_error_state that you want.  This is a snapshot of the register state at time of hang, and the top of it contains some error codes.  IPEHR, PGTBL_ER, ESR, EIR.  Match those codes up to see if you have the same or similar error.\nIf you're not on Intel Graphics (as in this case you're not), or if you're not seeing i915_error_state files generated, then dmesg and /var/log/kern.log are what to look at.  Sometimes with gpu lockups they will indicate what the GPU lockup was caused by or in.\nThe open source -ati driver has radeontool and avivotool, which capture register states.  These are primarily for the opensource -ati, but the tools should also work with -fglrx.  I've never seen it requested for an -fglrx bug, but it certainly can't hurt.\nTesting\nFor all drivers, the next step is usually to start testing either newer or older versions of the driver.  For proprietary drivers, you can check the x-updates ppa but probably you'll have to download and manually install the driver from the vendor website (and mess up your system's packaging in so doing).  For FOSS drivers like -intel, -nouveau, -ati that means testing either newer kernels or newer mesa.  We provide packaged builds of newer kernels at http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/.  For mesa, there are various PPAs such as xorg-edgers.  I'm also in process of preparing an 8.0.3 update for precise, which we believe fixes a number of lockups for Intel Graphics.\nIn any case, don't just stop when you find a version that works.  Try other versions in between your working version and the broken one.  If you can narrow the bracket down to two adjacent versions, that can be hugely helpful to the developers in isolating what patch caused the regression.\nContributing\nAs you go through the troubleshooting you might spot errors, or might come up with improvements for the scripts or docs.  Contributions to any of these are warmly welcomed.  With the wiki docs, please do just go ahead and edit!  I try to update them at least once a year, but I don't always get around to it, and the next guy to visit the page will certainly appreciate your effort at improving them.\nFor changes to the scripts themselves, also quite welcomed.  Send me changes however you feel comfortable - as patches, a bzr or git branch, or even just copies of the script.  If you plan to do a lot of changes, a bzr branch with a merge proposal is the preferred way; tutorials on how to do this are available at code.launchpad.net, or feel free to catch me on IRC if you have questions.\nOr, if you're not ready to dig into coding but would like to flag errors or areas where more functionality is needed, you can file bug reports the usual way (ubuntu-bug xdiagnose).\nQuick Fixes\nIf you're not interested in doing any of the above debugging, here's some random tips:\nFor proprietary drivers, try uninstalling and purging them completely from your system, then reinstalling from scratch.  This unfortunately \"solves\" a lot of bugs...\nFor the FOSS drivers, there are various kernel switches you can play around with.  For 3D/mesa bugs, there is also driconf to tweak various settings.\nFinally\nFinally, one request...  please don't file bug reports to Launchpad about \"random freezes\" until you've done at least a little sleuthing such as described above.  Otherwise, you'd just be adding to the noise.\nWe do try to fish out well researched bug reports; we find these to give higher bang for the buck, and are a lot more likely to end up with an actual fix for the distro.\n", "Q: Installing at some custom location using apt-get To install a library I do sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev and it is installed at some default location.

I'm an avid LibreOffice user, and sometimes I use it to generate sensitive PDFs (meaning, for preview purposes; I'm a writer). Recently I tried the watermark feature for PDF exports, but it's an ugly green colour that makes reading very difficult.\nIs there a way to change the colour of the watermark?\n\nA: I don't think that any of the answers currently address this question. This question is referring to the new options to export a pdf with a watermark.\n\nFile --> Export as PDF\n\nUnder the General tab, see the Watermark section. \nCheck the box Sign with Watermark and enter watermark text.\nText appears in the pdf in bright green. \nIts not currently possible to change this value as its hard-coded into a patch which changed the color from bright red. This means that you'd have to change the value in the source code to do anything. The change was made to make the document more readable, and because the color is in-line with the LibreOffice colors. The discussion on the LO maillist is available here: \n\n\n*\n\n*Dev - [PATCH] Change of the color of the watermark at the pdfexport\nThere is some talk there of addressing the issue, but i don't think anything has been done yet. \n\nA: Yes but it's something of a hack.\nFirst, create a graphic in the package of your choice (Inkscape is a favourite of mine) for your watermark. This would be the word 'draft' for example. Make the page size of the graphic the same size and shape as the pages you're writing on in Libre Office and save it as a png. You can make it any shade or colour you like.\nYou can apply a background to any page by selecting Format>Page>Background and selecting graphic instead of colour. Set the background to take up the whole page area then browse to your png file.\nYou can create page styles that include any number of watermarks selecting the styles and formatting menu (F11) and going to page styles. Create a new page style and add your background using the process from the paragraph above. Save your new page style and you can apply it to any page you like. There's a screencast of this process on YouTube.\n\nA: It is rather remarkable. However I would not export with watermark sign !!!\nCreate a text in Draw, you decide whatever it says, be it Draft, Samply, Copyright etc and your layout and textcolour etc.\nSave it as .odg than use an online converter to make it a .png file.\nThis file you can use !! You just create a new Style in Libreoffice Writer and use the png file for the style.\nDouble click on the \"new\" style and you have your watermark. (This watermark remains even when the file is exported to PDF.)\nFor instructions I found the following video which helped me very much:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXdxK9JCW6Q\nHope this helps\n", "Q: Will installing as dual-boot harm my factory restore partition? I have a new Toshiba Satellite P740 laptop running the 64-bit version of Windows 7 Home Premium. At the moment, the machine comes with a secret partition that will restore the computer to its out-of-the-box, factory-fresh state by using a key combination at startup.  \nIf I install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 on this machine, will I still be able to access the secret partition? I'd like to be able to restore the machine this way if I ever need to sell it or something else goes horribly wrong.\n\nA: Nothing should happen to that partition as long as you are dual-booting, i.e. installing Ubuntu alongside Windows 7. Ubuntu will simply reduce the size of your main Windows partition and squeeze itself in.\nBefore:\n  [100MB Winboot |            100 GB C:\\                | 15 GB Restore Partition]\nAfter:\n  [100MB Winboot |  70 GB C:\\   |   30 GB Ext4-Ubuntu   | 15 GB Restore Partition]\n\nA: It will not do any harm to your factory partition and yes, You can restore from this secret partition unless and until you delete that partition in the Installation phase of Ubuntu.\nPlease, take special care for not to delete that partition by Gparted or \"Partition Disk\" phase of Ubuntu installation.\nI had a partition in My Lenovo 3000 Y410, I installed Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Linux Mint, Fedora and many others and Windows XP and 7. It did not delete the partition. Yes, If you deliberately delete that partition (as I did), It will get deleted.\nHow to identify the secret partition:\nMost of the time, The secret partition resides as the First or last partition of the disk. As @izx suggested, You can see that partition in Windows by Clicking on Start button, then type diskmgmt.msc and press Enter. Then select the Disk management in the left bar. Windows does not assign a Drive letter such as C: or D: to this partition. Most probably, Windows can show this partition as Hidden partition or something similar.\nHope this will answer your question.\n", "Q: Unable to boot from new SSD after installing from USB I'm using a new SSD with nothing on it.

Ensure that Linux has been properly installed first or your boot manager is not corrupt.\n\n\n*\n\n*Settings for hard drive are not correct\n\n\nThe computer freezing at \"Verifying dmi pool data...\" may be caused when the hard drive settings within CMOS are not set properly. Enter CMOS setup and verify that the hard drive settings are set properly and that it is set to Auto Detect.\n\n\n*\n\n*Floppy diskette or CD in computer causing issue\n\n\nVerify no floppy diskette or CD is in the computer. In some cases the computer may be trying to boot from either of these drives causing issues with the boot sequence.\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot devices not set properly\n\n\nThe computer stopping at \" verifying dmi pool data...\" can be caused when the boot devices on your computer are not set properly in CMOS. First, verify that no CD or diskette is in your computer. If a CD or diskette is in the computer remove this first to determine if it was attempting to boot from it.\nIf No CD or diskette is in the computer and your computer still halts at the DMI message enter CMOS setup and verify that the boot options are set properly. We commonly recommend that the floppy be set the first boot device, hard drive as the second boot device and the CD-ROM as the third boot device.\n\n\n*\n\n*BIOS corrupt or misc. setting not set properly\n\n\nIf none of the above recommendations have resolved your issue, reset the BIOS or CMOS settings to the factory or default settings.\n\n\n*\n\n*Connections loose or disconnected\n\n\nIf the computer has been recently moved or new hardware has been installed in the computer it is possible that a connection may be loose or even disconnected. Verify that the hard drive, floppy and CD-ROM cables are properly connected.\n\n\n*\n\n*Bad hard drive or other bad hardware\n\n\nIf you computer continues to freeze at the DMI message after attempting all of the above recommendations it is possible that the computer may be freezing because of a bad hard drive or other bad hardware in the computer.\nBefore replacing any hardware we first recommend you erase everything on the hard drive and start over.\nIf you're unable to get to the point of re-installing the operating system it's likely your computer has a hardware issue and it's suggested that the hard drive be replaced. If that doesn't resolve the issue then have the motherboard replaced.\nSource www.computerhope.com\n", "Q: IPTUX always runs in background I configured IPTUX to run in background by mistake.\nThe next time when i start it always runs in back ground. i tried to reinstall and also reinstalled with synaptic. still it starts in background.\nThanks,\nKavin\n\nA: I am stuck in the same situation but I know one thing for sure that you can modify the %gconf.xml file directly using \nsudo nano <config file path>/%gconf.xml\n\nwhich should be located in any of the following locations\n~/.cache/iptux\n~/.gconf/apps/iptux\n~/.config/iptux\nI did modify the file but when I restart the system it seems to have reverted back to the original.\nThe entry in the file that you need to look for, to modify is:\nname=\"hide_startup\" mtime=\"1343670281\" type=\"bool\" value=\"true\"\n\nchange it to:\nname=\"hide_startup\" mtime=\"1343670281\" type=\"bool\" value=\"false\"\n\nI believe, the reason for the file reverting back to the previous state is that iptux process must be running in the background and hence not allowing changes to the file.\nWhat I am looking for is a way to kill the iptux process before modifying the config file, but can't find a process for iptux.\nWill research it a bit and let you know if I find the process name.\n\nA: I also had the same problem.

Here are some alternatives:\nEnter superuser mode with \"sudo su\" in the terminal (will ask for your password), then run the commands from there:\nsudo su\nnautilus\n\nAnother alternative is to use something else for file exploration than nautilus, something that does not require graphical environment. GNU Midnight Commander - mc comes to mind. You can install and run it like this:\nsudo apt-get install mc\nmc\n\nYour error messages suggest that the root \"Cannot open display\". The reason might be that the DISPLAY environment is not properly set up. You can check it from the terminal like this:\nprintenv | grep DISPLAY\n\nYou should see something like DISPLAY=:0.0 in response. If not, take care of the display environment for the root first.\n\nA: How to run Gedit AND Nautilus as administrator with pkexec instead of gksu or gksudo\nGVfs method tested in Ubuntu 18.04\nUse the GVfs admin backend, just add admin:// to the beginning of the full path to your preferred directory.\nOpen Nautilus the usual way and press Ctrl+L to enable typing in the address-bar, and then enter for example admin:///usr/ to open the /usr/ directory.\nEnter your admin password when prompted and you will see something like this:\n\nAt this point clicking on the folders with locks will open with admin privileges.\nYou may bookmark a folder that is opened with admin:/// prefix. When you click on such a bookmark later you may be prompted for the admin password again.\nAlternatively, from the Terminal open nautilus with the argument admin:///usr/:\nnautilus admin:///usr/\n\nto open the /usr/ directory as root in Nautilus.\nEditing text files with admin privileges\nFrom Nautilus opened in this way, if you click on a text file that needs admin privileges, you will be prompted for password again, before it opens in your default editor such as Gedit.\nIf you are using Ubuntu 17.10\nThe following method does not work with Wayland by default. There are some workarounds. The easiest one is not to use Wayland. How do you switch from Wayland back to Xorg in Ubuntu 17.10? Other alternatives are described in Why don't gksu/gksudo or launching a graphical application with sudo work with Wayland?\nUbuntu will switch back to Xorg by default in 18.04 LTS and the workarounds will not be needed then.\nOriginal answer\nSource: WebUpd8\ngksu hasn't been updated since 2009 and is not recommended any more. In fact, Ubuntu no longer ships with gksu by default (though it may be installed for many of you, because some apps still depend on it) and it may even be completely removed at some point.\nNautilus admin adds PolicyKit files for both Nautilus and Gedit and it allows opening a file or folder from Nautilus as root, via PolicyKit:\nTo install Nautilus Admin in Ubuntu, open a terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T and use the following command:\nsudo apt-get install nautilus-admin\n\nAnd to restart Nautilus use either of the following commands:\nnautilus -q or killall nautilus\nAfter this when you right click on a folder you will see:\n\nIf you right click on a text file editable by Gedit you will see:\n\nThen you will be prompted for password:\n\nRelated question: \"Open in terminal\" not working on nautilus as root\nFinally, installing nautilus-admin also allows opening nautilus as root from the command line.

Here is the GUI way:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Nautilus using one of the following ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Press Super key, and search for \"Files\" (or \"Nautilus\").\n\n*Open Activities, and search for \"Files\" (or \"Nautilus\").\n\n\n*In the sidebar (on the left-hand-side), click on \"Other Locations\".\n\n*An address field appears on the bottom of Nautilus, with the text of \"Enter server address...\". Enter admin: (or admin:///), and press Enter (or click on the \"Connect\" button).\n\n*Enter your root password when prompted.\nEnjoy working as administrator (but be really careful)!\nNote: The benefit of using this way over others is that you can safely switch between root and non-root. You can use Nautilus as a root user and as a non-root one (i.e. the user yourself) in two separated tabs. This way, you will be ensure that, for instance, you will not make a file in your home directory with root permissions.\nAdd it to bookmarks\nNote: By adding administration explorer to bookmarks, sometimes Nautilus prompt you for root password when you open it.\n\n\n*\n\n*Follow the steps in the section above. Navigate to the directory of choice if needed, e.g. /bin.\n\n*Use one of the following ways:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use this shortcut: Ctrl + D.\n\n*From the toolbar on top, click on more button (with three dots). From the appeared drop-down menu, click on \"Bookmark this location\" button. The button is on the center of the first three buttons set.\n\n*From the location bar, click on \"Administrator Root\" or \"/\" (i.e. the folder you want to bookmark). From the appeared list, click on \"Add to bookmarks\".\n\n\n*To rename the bookmark you created, right click on it and choose \"Rename...\". Now you can enter a new name for it, e.g. \"Root\".\nBy clicking on your new bookmark, you can access files and directories as root. For me, it prompt the root password if I haven't enter it recently.\nHope it helps!\n\nA: When opening Nautilus with root privileges, it is best to use the command \ngksudo\n\nunless your root account is unlocked, and in that case, Ubuntu discourages this.\nThe reason for the \"gk\" is because sudo, by itself, doesn't perform the necessary actions automatically to properly run graphical applications as another user.\nHowever for instance, if you were on a KDE system such as Kubuntu, you would want to issue the command \nkdesudo\n\np.s. Do not leave your Nautilus root window open when you are not using it,then forgetting about it, as using a window you do not know is root is a bad idea.\nFor more information view the Ubuntu man page for gksudo here.\n\nA: If you find yourself opening nautilus as root often, I would recommend adding the option to the right-click menu in Unity: (it uses the same command as the top answer, gksu nautilus).\nYou will need to edit a *.desktop file in order to add the menu option, and you have two choices:\n\n\n*\n\n*/usr/share/applications/nautilus.desktop (requires root access to edit) - The menu option will be added for all users. Note that you may need to re-edit this file, adding the option if an update to Nautilus occurrs that overwrites your changes.\n\n*~/.local/share/applications/nautilus.desktop (If you can't find it there, make a duplicate of the one found in /usr/share/applications/, and save it to this new location) - The menu option will only be available for the specified user, and is considered \"better practice\". Note that if you already have it docked to your Unity bar, you will need to choose Unlock from Launcher on your existing Nautilus icon (by default shows up as named Files), then re-add your \"custom\" version. These changes should stay even if Nautilus gets an update.\n\n\nEdit the text file nautilus.desktop, adding the following block of code (you can use the existing two blocks as a template):\n[Desktop Action RootWindow]\nName=Open a Root Window\nExec=gksu nautilus\nOnlyShowIn=Unity;\n\nNext, add the new action to the list (should be at around line 18 of the text file):\nActions=Window;RootWindow;\n\nNow right-clicking the text editor window in Unity brings up this handy new option:\n\n\nA: Nautilus Admin (nautilus-admin) is a simple Python extension for the Nautilus file manager that adds some administrative actions to the right-click menu:\n\n*\n\n*Open as Administrator: opens a folder in a new Nautilus window     running with administrator (root) privileges.\n\n*Edit as Administrator: opens a file in a Gedit window running     with administrator (root) privileges.\n\nTo install Nautilus Admin in all  currently supported versions of Ubuntu open the terminal and type:\nsudo apt install nautilus-admin\n\n\nA: Open terminal and type the following:\nsessionfile=$(find \"${HOME}/.dbus/session-bus/\" -type f)\nexport $(grep \"DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=\" \"${sessionfile}\" | sed '/^#/d')\n\nTry running your command again (sudo nautilus).\n\nA: If you are running Ubuntu Live or Persistent install, sudo nautilus is ok, everything on the drive, except home, is already owned by root and is read only. \nIf you create, copy or modify a file or folder, inside the home folder on the persistent drive as root using sudo nautilus the permissions will be restored to owner on reboot. If you create, copy or modify a file on a different drive using sudo nautilus the permissions will revert to owner once the usb drive is shut down.\n\nA: Edit your /etc/profile with:\nsudo nano /etc/profile\n\nThen add this to the end of the file:\nxhost +local:all\n\nCtrl+X to quit.\nY to confirm.\nEnter to confirm path.\nDone.\nRun anything as root.\n", "Q: How can I make my PC faster? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I improve overall system performance? \n\nMy computer is running very slow. It appears I may be running Ubuntu 10.04. Please let me know how to increase it's performance.\n\nA: Upgrading to 12.04 could help.\nOften it helps to make some hardware changes, such as upgrading your RAM or getting a faster hard drive.\n\nA: Or you can try to speed up your system by freeing up your RAM. For this go to a terminal and type:\nfree -m\n\nYou will get your RAM information along with your swap memory info. By freeing up the RAM you can speed up your Ubuntu system. To free up your RAM, type:\nsudo -s\nsync\necho 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n\nThen finally\nfree -m\n\nYou can see the difference from this output. I hope this helps.\n\nA: Well first of all, speeding your system involves couple of step, if upgrading your hardware is not in the cards, do following steps:\nSpeed is mostly determined by available RAM,so choose a light DE such as XFCE or LXDE or Even Awesome or Wmii window manager.\nYou can check the unnecessary services and processes running that you don't need.Say you have apache and MySQL running in your LAMP server and you don't need them at that time you can close it.\nNext use and updated kernel, latest kernels do perform better and if you are using AMD graphics drivers, Open Source Drivers do perform better.\nPlus having some swap space allocated is always good.\n", "Q: Why is Ubuntu offline (except torrents) while Windows is online?

Looking forward for help from anyone.\nThanks to all.\n\nA: You don't say what version of Ubuntu you are running. I will assume 12.04 for now.\nOn 12.04 and later, you shouldn't be editing /etc/resolv.conf as any changes there get overwritten by other tools.\nGenerally, network configuration is now managed in NetworkManager. Firstly then, check NetworkManager: using the network indicator in the top bar, open the settings for your connection, check the IPv4 tab a report back what is there.\nIf it is anything other than auto, make a note of all of the settings, then change it to \"Automatic (DHCP)\". See if that helps.\nThe next thing to check is the output from:\ncat /run/nm-dns-dnsmasq.conf\n\nSince this is where NetworkManager squirrels away the DNS settings.

After running startx you should then execute export DISPLAY=:0 (:0 for the first X display), then you can run xterm, which you will not see of course.\nI assume you want to connect via vnc, or something similar afterwards.\n\nA: Maybe you mean to gain shell access to the headless server? Install openssh-server on it and use ssh to connect to that from another computer. THEN, from your workstation, you can ssh -X serverhostname to ssh with X into that headless server. Once on the command line, you can run xterm & and then a new window will pop up on YOUR local X session from that remote machine. So you do still install xterm (or any other gui program) on the server but you do not install any pseudo packages like ubuntu-desktop.

Thanks!\n\nA: I hope my answer won't be too generic, as I have little to no experience with iPods etc, but perhaps you might still find this useful.\nThe problem might be that Wine \"sees\" the iPod through the Linux drivers, which makes it very different from connecting your iPod through Windows or Mac. iTunes expects to see a USB device with a certain driver, and because Linux intervenes here, it will see a different one that it cannot recognise.\nIf this is true (and if anyone reads this, please correct me if you DID get your iPod to work through Wine), I'm afraid it will be very hard to get your iPod to work through Wine.\nThere are plenty of Linux native alternatives available though. For example, Rhythmbox claims to support iPods through its plugins.\nIf you want to read more on iTunes user experiences with Wine, try WineHQ.\nUpdate: izx has another good idea if you want to run iTunes on your Linux machine and be able to synchronise your iPod: set up a virtual machine (e.g. through VirtualBox). If you then enable USB support you should be able to synchronise your stuff. Again, I cannot confirm this from my own experience, but it seems that izx is usually right :)\n", "Q: MySQL starting error I installed LAMP not so long ago and it worked fine but ever time I try start MYSQL server I see this thing:\n$ /etc/init.d/mysql start\nRather than invoking init scripts through /etc/init.d, use the service(8)\nutility, e.g. service mysql start\n\nSince the script you are attempting to invoke has been converted to an\nUpstart job, you may also use the start(8) utility, e.g. start mysql\nstart: Rejected send message, 1 matched rules; type=\"method_call\", sender=\":1.20\" (uid=1000 pid=3137 comm=\"start mysql \") interface=\"com.ubuntu.Upstart0_6.Job\" member=\"Start\" error name=\"(unset)\" requested_reply=\"0\" destination=\"com.ubuntu.Upstart\" (uid=0 pid=1 comm=\"/sbin/init\")\n\nHow can I fix this?\n\nA: You should just take some time to actually read the message since it is not an error. \nTry this instead:\nsudo service mysql start\n\nAny change in output?\nThe reason for this is that the traditional sysvinit have been replaced by Upstart / Services as of Ubuntu 6.10. However, a great load of packages still use the old sysvinit way, which have been left in place for backwards compability. The biggest difference, apart from having to use another command, is that upstart is event driven, on the contrary of sysvinit which is a sequencial service manager.\n\nA: There's nothing to fix. That is not an error. Ubuntu has converted your init.d script to an upstart job so that you use service util to start/stop a service which is much shorter to type than doing /etc/init.d/script\nSo now, instead of typing /etc/init.d/mysql start/stop/status you can just type service mysql start/stop/status or start/stop/status mysql\n", "Q: /build folder used by PEAR I've just noticed a root directory (/build) which I can't seem to find any information for.\nIt looks like it's some sort of staging ground for PEAR (PHP).

The home directory of the new installation was set to be encrypted.\nThen the installation went wrong because of the cd. So it really never started (stopped at coping stage). How ever Ubuntu did encrypted the home directory but probably the procedure went wrong.\nBy now I installed Ubuntu in another partition, tried to mount with encrypted-recovery but the mounted directory in tmp wasn't the directory I had before. There were just strange directories with coded name.\nStrange fact is that the file system is not damaged: it continues to know how much data is actually stored in it. If I look with gparted or even nautilus I see 45 Gb of data present on the partition. This let me think that my data are not erased but maybe hidden.\nMoreover when I tried to mount the encrypted home directory with encrypted-recovery-personal it asked me the encryption secret.

Sounds a little paradox, isn't it?\nWhat should I do with this?  Why does this even come up?\n\nA: This happens because apport fails to see the parent package of the failed executable file. apport, which is Ubuntu's problem reporter, watches every problem in Program execution.\nWhen a program crashes, apport is triggered to find the program (It watches for the programs execution constantly, unless you disabled it) which indicates Abnormal program termination. It finds the executable file which has crashed and search for the system for package that includes this executable file. When It fails to find a parent package containing that executable file, (in dpkg's database) It shows that error, saying \"The report belongs to a package that is not installed.\"\nFor example:\nI uses a program for my Wimax modem, called wimaxc (which is not installed by any package manager). It sometimes fails and apport also fails to find the parent package of the executable file, /usr/bin/wimaxc, hence , It shows that error message.\nTo find the parent package of an executable file:\nIf you want to find the parent package of an executable file, for example /usr/bin/gnome-terminal type the command below in a terminal:\ndpkg -S /usr/bin/gnome-terminal\n\nIt will give you an output similar to this\ngnome-terminal: /usr/bin/gnome-terminal\n\nHere, gnome-terminal is the parent package of the file /usr/bin/gnome-terminal.\nNote: Whenever you installed a package, it is listed in the dpkg's database. So, if you use a program, not installed by the package manager (such as apt-get, synaptic, aptitude or Software-Center), apport will always fail to find the parent package, when it crashes, because their is no parent package\n\nA: The question that led me here was, \"Which package isn't installed?\"\nI found the answer by sorting the contents of /var/crash/ by date.\n", "Q: Install Ubuntu from iso file using grub2 I have previous versions of Ubuntu, which includes grub2.

I was wondering what the difference between running and trying Ubuntu and I was also wondering if there was any downfall to running Ubuntu on a USB drive.\n\nA: *\n\n*Running (or installing) Ubuntu usually means you put it permanently on your hard disk, either by itself or alongside Windows, etc. You use it every day, all your documents/settings are saved, just like Windows.\n\n*Trying Ubuntu usually means you start it from a Live-CD or a Live-USB. You can use it for the duration of that session, but your saved documents/changes/etc. are lost when you shut the computer down (although you can set up \"persistence\" to prevent that).\n\n*Running Ubuntu from a USB drive is possible, either using persistence or actually installing to the drive as if it were a hard drive. The downsides include:\n\n*\n\n*Slow: Regular USB \"stick/flash\" drives are nowhere near as fast as hard drives, and it will show, possibly detracting from your experience.\n\n*Lower life:: The frequent writes/swapping done by an operating system may be injurious to the health of your flash drive. e.g. it may only last one year instead of a normal five.\n\n*Limited space: If you intend to use Ubuntu for a decent period of time and/or use it for multimedia (movies, music, etc.), you will eventually run out of space even if you get, say, a 32 GB flash drive. That doesn't happen with hard drives, which are typically much larger.\n\n\n\nA: Try Ubuntu or Install Ubuntu when installing\nMakes no difference, I use them interchangeably when installing Ubuntu.\nTry Ubuntu gives a chance to prepare the target disk in GParted or double check the partition table, but it can be prepared in \"Something else\" just as easy.\nChoosing Install Ubuntu is slightly more direct.\nBoth have all the same options, the end results are the same.\n", "Q: I can't install Ubuntu 12.04 on my desktop My desktop is about 2 years old. It has \"Intel G41 chipset\" with \"Intel Core2duo processor\", 4GB DDR2 RAM.  \nI want to install Ubuntu 12.04 alongside Windows 7. I downloaded \"ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.iso\" file and burn it on to a CD. Then I inserted in it on my drive and reboot my desktop.\nInstallation started, but after passing almost half an hour, installation stopped. It showed error lines like this:\n2816.493003 end_request I/O error,dev sr0, sector 1291668\n\nWhen  installation stopped, I re-inserted the CD and ran wubi.exe from Windows, then tried \"help me boot from CD\" option, but after 3-4 mins, an error message popped up saying \"permission denied\".\nI also tried the option described in here, but same messages show every time. \nWhat should I do to install Ubuntu now?\n\nA: I had the same problem and I solved it this way:\n\n\n*\n\n*as far as the boot helper is concerned, I removed the failed helper installation and in the BIOS I set boot priority to cd\n\n*errors during installation were solved by burning the same iso on another CD after ensuring the correctness of its md5 hash; probabily the previous burning had some problems or the cd was not clean..\n\n\nI hope that these solutions will help you..\n\nA: Check the md5 hash of the iso file you have downloaded.\nInstall hashcheck shell extension in windows. Right click on ISO, go to properties and select checksum tab. Copy the md5.\nNow open this page, press Ctrl+F and paste the md5. See if it matches the correct version.\nIf not possibly your download is corrupted and you need to redownload.\nAlso run wubi as administrator if you are using windows 7. There may be some permission problem if you are changing any file in c: drive.\n\nA: That I/O error you're getting, it's because of a failing hard drive. Probably many bad sectors on it.\nIn the live session of Ubuntu, check  out the SMART Status of your drive in the Disk Utility tool. If it shows 'A few bad sectors' or anything similar, you need to get a new drive.\nIf everything is fine, open Windows, Install hashcheck and check the md5 hash of the ISO file you've downloaded.\nPS - I'd advise you not to use wubi.

Firefox is responsible to do so. to  HUD is a replacement of menu items/commands. In firefox such menu doesn't exist.\nI don't think at present you can change the HUD behavior. (If I am wrong please feel free to correct me). Anyway you can press ctrl+L or F6 or ALT+D to goto the address bar.\nYou can send mail to    dev-apps-firefox@lists.mozilla.org.  requesting this feature.\n\nA: What HUD can do :\nInstead of a nested tree of options, users will have a \"vocabulary UI\" that's \"closer to the way users think\" according to Shuttleworth. .\nSo instead of having the traditional \"File,\" \"Edit,\" \"View\" menus (and so on) we can pull down a menu to type in commands. So if I want to change preferences I'd start typing \"pref\" and (in theory) the HUD will suggest commands that matches that.\nWhich probably says it is an Integrated Menu Utility of active Application . Since Firefox menu don't have any such MENU option like Go to URL or Enter the URL you want to Navigate, so currently in present scenario we can't go to desired URL from HUD.\nAccording to Unity/HUD Wiki Page\n\nHUD is in a very early stage of development, and not ready for\n  production  use.\n\nSo if you are interested in developing such features , you probably can by joining the Launchpad and getting involved in that project. \nFor further reading and references here :Link1, Link2, and Link3.\n\nA: Oh wow, I accidently found out that you can type in the URL in the Dash-Board instead of the HUD.\n", "Q: How to install a driver for HP LaserJet P1102 printer?

I am building a app with quickly, and I wanted to add a daemon that will run in the background. How do you do this?\n\nA: As far I know there is nothing specific in quickly to prevent or assist you with running daemons, but there is at least two options I know/guess you can do it with python:\nOption #1: Distutils\nNOTE: I didn't tried this one yet :)\n\n\n*\n\n*put your daemon script into the bin directory of your quickly project, e.g.: bin/yourapp-launcher\n\n*add the following into the data/yourapp-launcher.desktop file:\n[Desktop Entry]\nName=Your App\nExec=/bin/sh -c 'yourapp-launcher'\nType=Application\nX-GNOME-Autostart-Delay=30\nIcon=yourapp\nComment=\nNoDisplay=true\n\n\n*edit setup.py and specify additional data_files in DistUtilsExtra section, e.g.:\nDistUtilsExtra.auto.setup(\nname='hello-ubuntu',\nversion='0.1',\n#license='GPL-3',\n#author='Your Name',\n#author_email='email@ubuntu.com',\n#description='UI for managing â¦',\n#long_description='Here a longer description',\n#url='https://launchpad.net/hello-ubuntu',\ncmdclass={'install': InstallAndUpdateDataDirectory},\ndata_files=[('/etc/xdg/autostart', ['data/yourapp-launcher.desktop'])]\n)\n\nSeems a way to go when daemon must be running for all users, e.g. similar how U1 works.\nOption #2: Hardcode\nHardcode everything into your app logic, for example initialize ~/.config/autostart/yurapp-launcher.desktop on the first run, e.g. similar to how GmailNotify App does it.\nUnlike GmailNotify App you can relie on the python-xdg library to access freedesktop.org standards:\nimport xdg\nprint xdg.BaseDirectory.xdg_config_home\n\nSeems good for user managed daemons.\n\nA: From what I can see there is no template to add a daemon in quickly. However, you can contribute by creating a daemon template. How to create your own template is explained in the answer to this question: How to create a new quickly application template\nYou could also join the community templates group at Launchpad, to make your template available for others to use. \nEDIT: There is also the Unity lens template. It will only work with Ubuntu Unity, so you will be platform dependent (rather significant weakness if you ask me). But it seems to have D-Bus things ready from the start. Kind of like a daemon, but maybe not quite. You could use this as a starting-point to create a platform independent daemon, perhaps...\nI don't know any details other than what I can link from others, sorry. Just looking at this myself to find out how to use Qt4 with quickly. EDIT2: Just found that there is a D-Bus component to Qt, which would make your daemon platform independent (working on Windows and Linux etc). This discussion forum (http://www.qtcentre.org/threads/38453-Send-and-receive-a-signal-between-2-Qt-applications) has an example (in C++, but still) of how to use it. Or you can google for QDBusConnection and QDBusMessage.\n\nA: Looking through the Quickly docs, it seems that Quickly does not natively support creating daemons. Therefore I suggest the Python Daemon Library. Also, go over the following Python tutorials that could be interfaced easily from a Quickly application:\n\n\n*\n\n*Writing a Python Daemon\n\n*A simple unix/linux daemon in Python\n\n*Creating a daemon the Python way\nAlso, this Stack Overflow question addresses Python daemons.\n\nA: Python 3.3 will have a daemon module for the management of daemons.\n", "Q: Cannot execute shell /bin/zsh when execute a shell command in vi I use bash.

I only have one super account. I tried to press ctrl-alt-f1 to enter into full screen login mode, however I still couldn't login.\nCan anybody help? \n\nA: You could try booting into “single user mode” or “recovery mode” in order to fix your problem. As I'm not Using vanilla Ubuntu installations that often, I'm not sure how the latest version of the recovery mode looks like, whether its shell option will ask you for a password, and if it does, whether that passwort check uses pam. So you'll have to give it a try.\nIf that doesn't work, as a last resort you could append init=/bin/bash to your boot command line in grub. That will dump you into a shell very early during boot, so many services will not be available, but it won't display a login prompt either, so it should enable you to fix your pam setup unless that is on a partition which isn't mounted by that time. You'll probably have to remount your root fs writable before doing any changes: mount / -o remount,rw.\n", "Q: Proper fstab entry to mount a samba share on boot?

If I have a toolbar set up, and I have a button on it, is it possible to get it to open a window right within the program? I mean like open up a different section of the program much like the function, notepad1, would do? Or could I get it to imitate the behavior of what the system settings do, where it opens a window completely within the same window? If you can help, I appreciate it. I'm working with the default glade file if that helps anyone. \n\nA: I'm doing this in my App also. I achieved it by doing something similar to the following:\nIn your main window get a reference to the widget you want to use as your parent.  It must be a derivative of GtkContainer (such as GtkBox).\nIn my instance I did something like the following in my class constructor:\nself.itemAsMyContainer = self.builder.get_object(\"name_of_object_id\")\n\nI then used glade to create another, separate ui file with a GtkContainer derivative such (in my case GtkBox) as its top level object, and then modified its Class name in a similar way to how quickly does it. I then created a separate class for it in a similar way to _lib/Window.py in the quickly template.  Once that was done I could simply instantiate this new class and attach it to my referenced Container with a piece of code like:\nself.my_sub_ui = MySexyGtkContainerSubClass()\nself.itemAsMyContainer.pack_start(self.my_sub_ui)\n\nI believe this same approach is possible with another window but you might have to unparent it.

Is it possible to set default user on login screen? Thx for help in advance.\nRegards,\nA\n\nA: Seems like you posted this on Ubuntu forums too... I am not sure whether there's a proper solution to this question. One thing is obvious that we have to mess with lightdm configuration files in /etc/lightdm to get this done, at least to some extent.\nI have tried messing with users.conf file, but so far I had no luck in doing it. I tried it with Guest, but may be you could have some luck in case of other users, especially if this user you want to have as default has more permissions and access than others.\nWhat I did was this:\nThis is the how my original users.conf file looked like:\n# User accounts configuration\n#\n# NOTE: If you have AccountsService installed on your system, then #LightDMwill\n# use this instead and these settings will be ignored\n#\n# minimum-uid = Minimum UID required to be shown in greeter\n# hidden-users = Users that are not shown to the user\n# hidden-shells = Shells that indicate a user cannot login\n#\n[UserAccounts]\nminimum-uid=500\nhidden-users=nobody nobody4 noaccess\nhidden-shells=/bin/false /usr/sbin/nologin\n\nI tried changing it to something like this:\n# User accounts configuration\n#\n# NOTE: If you have AccountsService installed on your system, then LightDM will\n# use this instead and these settings will be ignored\n#\n# minimum-uid = Minimum UID required to be shown in greeter\n# hidden-users = Users that are not shown to the user\n# hidden-shells = Shells that indicate a user cannot login\n[UserAccounts]\nuid < 1001\nIncludeAll = true\nInclude = myuserhere\nhidden-users=guest Guest\n\nThe UID for my account was 1000, so I used 1001 over there... \nYou can use\nid\n\ncommand  to check your own uid and may be you can set the settings in the file like this too:\nuid=1000\n\nI am not sure whether this would work or not.\nHowever, the above configuration didn't work. I think we have to tweak something little more over there to get what you want. Please look at this question to get some idea how to configure these files: How can I change the default user shown in the login screen?\nThe above question is about gdm and not lightdm, but the settings must be pretty much similar. So, you are on your own after that. Refer to this manual before you change them: http://people.ubuntu.com/~robert-ancell/lightdm/reference/\nAlso, make sure you take a backup of those conf files, because messing with lightdm sometimes kills your time better than anything else. Make sure you change to CLI using Alt + F2/F1 etc. and restore your backup if you break the whole thing.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How to hide the mouse cursor I'm building a kiosk using Ubuntu Precise on a touch screen. Now I'm looking for the appropriate way to make the mouse cursor disappear. As people know where they are pointing, displaying an arrow under their finger is useless, and having an arrow where they last pointed even more so.\nMy best bet would be some kind of cursor theme consisting only of transparent cursors. I'm a bit surprised to find no UI to switch and maybe install cursor themes in the default Unity UI, but as I won't be using Unity, that's not much of a problem. It appears that the alternatives listed in update-alternatives --list x-cursor-theme all refer to .theme files, so I searched the package list for those. The resulting list does not list any likely candidates, i.e. no packages containing “invisible” or “transparent” in their name.\nSo far, some googled result yielding a readme for “XCursor Transparent Theme” is my best bet. That would mean compiling those sources myself, perhaps putting them into my PPA. I'm also a bit sceptical about that result as said readme is dated from 2003. And I'm not sure that I'm not making things overly complicated. After all, there is quite some support in Precise for touch devices, so I don't believe I'm the first one who wants to get rid of his mouse cursor.\n\n\n*\n\n*Is there another way which doesn't involve user-compiled binary code?\n\n*Is there a theme package for transparent cursors which I've overlooked?\n\n*Is there some other mechanism to make the cursor disappear without changing the cursor theme?\n\n\nI'll be using Matchbox WM, Firefox and Java applets, so I'll be happy with any solution working under such a setup. I'm not interested in any solutions twiddling with Gnome or Compiz, as I'll not be running either.\n\nA: Try unclutter.\nThe purpose of this program is to hide the pointer after the mouse has not moved for a while. Using it, you can make the pointer appear only when the user touches the screen, and disappear right after it. Maybe this was not exactly what you were aiming for, but it is much easier than your alternative.\nTo use it, first install it:\nsudo apt-get install unclutter\n\nthen run it:\nunclutter -idle 0.01 -root\n\nThe number in the above command is the number of seconds before the pointer disappears (in this case, 1/100 seconds).\n\nA: Ubuntu 16.04\nOpen /usr/share/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-xserver-command.conf and edit this line:\nxserver-command=X -core\n\nAppend -nocursor to it. Like this:\nxserver-command=X -core -nocursor\n\nSave and restart.\nWarning: Like other answers on this question, mistakes on this file will prevent Xorg initialization. Anyway, you can still can login to terminal and revert.\n\nA: If you never want the cursor to appear (appropriate for touchscreens) unclutter won't suffice from my experience. Instead you can use use -nocursor when starting X.\nExample:\nstartx -nocursor\n\nSee http://www.x.org/wiki/AdvancedTopicsFAQ/#index1h2\n\nA: If you are using lightdm:\nEdit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf by adding:\nxserver-command=X -bs -core -nocursor\n\n\nif you are using nodm:\nEdit /etc/default/nodm by replacing:\nNODM_X_OPTIONS='-nolisten tcp'\n\nwith\nNODM_X_OPTIONS='-nolisten tcp -nocursor'\n\n\nThis is building from Gibbs very helpful answer\n\nA: Another Option is to set the cursor theme in ubuntu to an invisible theme. For that I created one. You can find it here https://github.com/gysi/ubuntu-invis-cursor-theme\n\nA: Another option I have found is to use xbanish.\n\n*\n\n*Clone the repository into your directory of choice\n\ngit clone https://github.com/jcs/xbanish\n\n\n\n*(optional) I had to make sure that libxt-dev was installed with\n\nsudo apt install libxt-dev\n\n\n\n*After making sure that you are in the xbanish directory, make the file by just running\n\nmake\n\n\n\n*Now you may run with\n\n./xbanish\n\nYou should note that this solution will only work if you have the program running, so you may want to set it to run at start up as well.\n\nA: Unclutter new x11 version  has some options of note start hidden and hide on touch https://github.com/Airblader/unclutter-xfixes/blob/master/src/unclutter.c\nChange unclutter.c\nConfig config = {\n.timeout = 0, //default 5\n.jitter = 0,\n.exclude_root = false,\n.ignore_scrolling = false,\n.ignore_buttons.count = 0,\n.ignore_buttons.buttons = NULL,\n.hide_on_touch = true, //default false\n.fork = false,\n.debug = false,\n.onescreen = false,\n.ignore_matches = false,\n.matches = NULL,\n.start_hidden = true //default false\n};\n", "Q: Can I repair a corrupted Ubuntu ISO file?

I cannot use a static IP for these, so using the /etc/network/interfaces to help me out is a nill point.\n# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)\n#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN\nnameserver 127.0.0.1\n\nIs there a way to get resolvconf to handle this either in the head, tail or base? If there is, are there any examples I can use to tweak on my server. \nAny help is much appreciated.\n\nA: Please look at resolvconf's man page. You can force inclusion of certain DNS settings by creating e.g. /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base:\n  /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base\n          File containing basic resolver information.  The lines  in  this\n          file  are  included in the resolver configuration file even when\n          no interfaces are configured.\n\nThere are other special files (head and tail), these may help you achieve what you want.\n\nA: For me, the above answers were inadequate for the following reasons:\n\n\n*\n\n*I'm not using resolvconf, just plain /etc/resolv.conf.\n\n*Using chattr +i to lock down resolv.conf seems too hacky. I need Puppet to be free to make changes when necessary.\n\n*AFAIK, editing /etc/network/interfaces doesn't prevent resolv.conf from being overwritten; it simply specifies the name servers that should be written. For me, specifying the name servers wasn't the point. I'm trying to set options timeout:1 and options attempts:1 in my resolv.conf file.\n\n\nThe best solution I found overrides the default behavior of dhclient using its documented hooks.\nCreate a new file at /etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/nodnsupdate with the following contents:\n#!/bin/sh\nmake_resolv_conf() {\n    :\n}\n\nThen make the file executable:\nchmod +x /etc/dhcp/dhclient-enter-hooks.d/nodnsupdate\n\nNow when dhclient runs -- either on reboot or when you manually run sudo ifdown -a ; sudo ifup -a -- it loads this script nodnsupdate. This script overrides an internal function called make_resolv_conf() that would normally overwrite resolv.conf and instead does nothing.\nThis worked for me on Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: I think the answer is check your /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf, i.e. don't request dns-nameservers from your dhcp client.\nThen update your /etc/network/interfaces\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\ndns-search google.com\ndns-nameservers dnsserverip\n\nThen your resolv.conf will get auto configured the way you want it.\nAdd to the dns-search and then run a /etc/init.d/networking restart  (even though this script's deprecated it still works). \n\nA: This may just be some weird quirk in my machine, but someone else might have the same corner case. \nI tried numerous ways to get my ISP nameservers included in /etc/resolv.conf with no success: \n\n\n*\n\n*I included them in /etc/network/interfaces and restarted networking. They didn't show up in /etc/resolv.conf.\n\n*I put them in /etc/resolv.conf explicitly, but of course they got overwritten.\nThey did show up in /run/resolvconf/interface/eth0.inet, but never made it to /etc/resolv.conf.\n\n*I tried configuring resolvconf for dynamic updates. No change.\nFinally I read somewhere that if the local machine (127.0.0.1) shows up in /etc/resolv.conf any other nameservers are not included.\nIn desperation I edited /run/resolvconf/interface/lo.named, deleted the only line in it (nameserver 127.0.0.1) and restarted: ifdown eth0 && ifup eth0.\n/etc/resolv.conf then included my ISP nameservers for the first time! I ran service network-manager restart to see if it was stable and /etc/resolv.conf still includes my ISP nameservers. Rebooted just to make sure and it's still there but /run/resolvconf/interface/lo.named got reset to: nameserver 127.0.0.1.\nCuriously restarting networking still works: /etc/resolv.conf still contains my ISP nameservers. I can't explain this (can someone?) but this might help someone stuck in the same spot.\n\nA: This is likely caused by DHCP configuration when you first installed Ubuntu. Try this 3-step process to handle this auto configuration issue.\nFirst\nEdit your interface configuration, which is located in: /etc/network/interfaces\nAdd this line below iface lo inet loopback:\ndns-nameservers yourdns youraltdns\n\nAs an example for Google DNS, you may want to use this:\ndns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4\n\nSecond\nEdit your DHCP configuration file, located at:\n/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf\n\nMark the syntax as a comment using # on every line\nor simply remove every request name-server.\nIn 16.04, you may not be required to make any changes here.\nThird\nRestart your networking by using this command :\n/etc/init.d/networking restart\n\nIn 16.04:\nsudo ifdown -a\nsudo ifup -a\n\n\nA: add your nameserver to file /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head. The file contains message that you had received: \nthat file should looks like this after adding 8.8.8.8\nroot@hvnatvcc: ~ # cat /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head \n# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)\n#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\n\n\nA: add on the last line eg:\nnameserver 8.8.8.8\n\nOpen up a terminal and type \nsudo chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf\n\nthe +i takes care that the file wont be reseted on a boot.\nTo undo the above \nsudo chattr -i /etc/resolv.conf\n\nFor more \nman chattr\n\n\nA: Add entries in /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head\necho 'search puppetmaster.com' | sudo tee -a /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head\necho 'nameserver 192.168.1.XXX' | sudo tee -a /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head\n\nand run following command\nsudo resolvconf -u\n\n\nA: Using resolvconf and disabling systemd-resolved.service (this works for me ubuntu 19.04):\n\n\n*\n\n*Install resolvconf\nsudo apt install resolvconf\n\n\n*Adding nameservers\nOpen /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base with your text editor, I use vim.\nsudo vim /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base\n\nthen, add the nameservers inside the opened file, ex.:\nnameserver 1.1.1.1\nnameserver 1.0.0.1\n\n\n*Updating resolv.conf\nsudo resolvconf -u\n\n\n*Disable systemd-resolved.service and reboot. nameserver 127.0.0.53 is not written to /etc/resolv.conf.\nsudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved.service\nsudo reboot\n\nDone!\nSource\n\nA: As many other answers state this has to do with resolvconf being installed in your system.\nSo the best way to keep something in resolv.conf that won't get lost on reboot is to include it in resolvconf configuration files that are in:\n/etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/\n\nIn there go for the head file. Whatever you put there will be written at the top of /etc/resolv.conf\nSo everything will go to something like this:\n# echo nameserver 8.8.8.8 >> /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head\n# resolvconf --enable-updates\n# resolvconf -u\n\n\nA: It's probably better to have your DNS server be able to resolve 'puppet' to the right address, and either to have your DHCP server hand out the DNS nameserver address and search list or else (if you have static IP addresses) to have something like the following in /etc/network/interfaces.\niface eth0 inet static\n    address 192.168.3.3\n    netmask 255.255.255.0\n    gateway 192.168.3.1\n    dns-search example.com\n    dns-nameservers 192.168.3.45 192.168.8.10\n\nBut if you do want to do it via the resolvconf configuration files you will want to edit /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base. In that file, put in your info as you would in resolv.conf.\nnameserver 192.168.1.XXX\n\nThen tell resolvconf to regenerate resolv.conf.\nsudo resolvconf -u\n\n\nA: The other solutions did not work for me on my Fedora 20 system.  My particular problem was that the \"search\" line in /etc/resolv.conf was being overwritten.  Here is what fixed it.  (This assumes that NetworkManager is producing the line\nsearch rn.yourcompany.com  and you want to have it be \nsearch rn.yourcompany.com yourcompany.com intnet.yourcompany.com:\n1.Use the \"ifconfig\" command to find out what interface is of interest:\n$ ifconfig\n  :\n  :\n\nem2:  <this was the one which was connected>\n\n2.Become root and change to the system configuration network devices directory:\n$ sudo su -[sudo] \npassword for youruser:\n# cd /etc/sysconfig/networking/devices`\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Use your favorite available editor to add a Domain line with the additional domains to search:\n\n\nDOMAIN=\"yourcompany.com intnet.yourcompany.com\"\nSave, logout, and log back in.  NetworkManager should now have the line in \\etc\\resolve.conf:\nsearch rn.yourcompany.com yourcompany.com intnet.yourcompany.com\n\n\nA: For Ubuntu Server 18 Netplan is the new utility for configuring networking.\n# cd /etc/netplan\n\nThen edit nameservers addresses entry in yaml file (use correct indentation). For example, if you use Google's DNS servers :\nnameservers:\n    addresses: [8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4]\n\nTo restart the service\n# netplan apply\n\nSee https://netplan.io/\nhttps://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-set-dns-nameservers-in-ubuntu-server-18-04/\n\nA: Mi solution on 12.04:\nI noticed that if you add the dns-nameserver in interfaces that do not take the name resolution servers\nresolvconf man page \nTo make resolv.conf not change when we edit manually do this in the terminal:\nsudo resolvconf –disable-updates\n\nafter:\nsudo resolvconf -a eth0 # or your network interface\n\nthen manually edit /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf adding a maximum of two DNS servers.\nThen restart the service:\nsudo /etc/init.d/networking restart\n\n\nA: If you are using DHCP, edit /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf to add additional DNS servers:\nprepend domain-name-servers 12.34.56.78, 12.34.56.79;\n\nThe DHCP client overwrites the dns-nameservers in etc/network/interfaces and I think in /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base too.\nThis worked for me in Ubuntu server 14.04.3.\nSee the Debian NetworkConfiguration Wiki for details.\n\nA: I found this the simplest fix. If you have resolv.conf and resolvconf files they will step on one another. You need to remove the resolv.conf file that get and overwrite every time you do a reboot.\nPut the nameserver 1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1 at the bottom of the resolvconf file and then run\nsudo rm /etc/resolv.conf\n\nTo get rid of the file. Then do a restart and everything will work.\n\nA: Just backup your resolve.conf and delete the resolvconf pacage and edit the /etc/resolv.conf file to whatever you want.\napt-get remove -y resolvconf\necho 'nameserver 8.8.8.8' > /etc/resolv.conf\n\nWe should have right to choose to not use bad software like resolvconf.\nBy the way, search field in the /etc/resolv.conf is useless.\n\nA: Another way is to configure resolvconf(8) to use the local search domain and nameservers before querying the DHCP-supplied search domains and nameservers. That is accomplished by creating /etc/resolvconf.conf (sudo nano /etc/resolvconf.conf):\nsearch_domains=\"nono.com\"\nname_servers=\"1.1.1.1 1.0.0.1\"\n\nThank you Brian Cunnie at pivotal blog\n\nA: none of the above worked for me on Ubuntu 20.4\nI ended up adding the following entry to my root's crontab\n@reboot sleep 20 && /root/restoreDNS>/etc/restoreDNS.out 1>2&\nbasically after 20 seconds of booting up; it executes a shell script that copies my version onto /etc/resolv.conf\nand it was good for me.\n\nA: That configuration is declared in /etc/default/bind9\nRESOLVCONF=no|yes\n\nno = don't apply the condition in the init.d bind9\nyes, or other value = override resolv.conf\nThis problem accures when you install bind9 and don't care about check all confs.\n\nA: Just put a\ndns-search google.com && dns-nameservers (sample: 8.8.8.8)\n\ncommand on your /etc/network/interfaces configuration. then restart your network.\nit should work.\n", "Q: Machine check error while booting from USB I put the last Ubuntu iso on my USB stick using UNetBootin, after formatting it to fat32. I've already done that before with other operating systems and it worked. I can't actually boot Ubuntu from USB since I get a black screen with the error \"Machine check error\" on top the an automatic reboot happens. The error appears right after the boot, I can't see anything else before.\nI'm using my ASUS K53SV latop. Does anybody know how to solve this?\n\nA: More a workaround than a solution, but since I couldn't solve the problem with the USB stick, I was finally able to boot from a CD, that's how I installed Ubuntu on my Laptop.\n\nA: Apparently is completely related to the Bios settings. \nTry:\nFirst of all, double check that the .iso image you downloaded is sane. In order to do that you can check the MD5SUM signature to completely discard that your iso is corrupted due to an incomplete download. (I know it is a silly thing, but it was actually my first error, the image was corrupted. If that's your case too, download it again). \n1) Disable the \"secure boot\" feature in your bios\n-Reboot, select the boot unit (that should say something starting with UEFI if you are booting from a USB Stick) and try to boot. If that does not work, try the next step.\n2) if you have an intel processor, then try disabling the \"Vitualization Technology\" feature\n*-Reboot, select the boot unit (that should say something starting with UEFI) and try to boot. That worked for me. *\nnotes: for sure you will need to disable the first. Try it alone, then try it combined with the Virtualization Technology disabled. If it works, like in my case, you can turn it on again cause it affects the performance of the virtual machines you may use (e.g. with VMWARE or Virtualbox). If you don't know what a virtual machine is, then you can leave the VT off. \nTested in an Asus Zenbook from 2014.\nCheers!\n", "Q: nvidia drivers Multiple launchers I have recently changed a video card in my machine running Precise to GeForce and tried running it with native NVIDIA driver.\nNow I have a problem because I have 2 monitors 22\" wide and 19\" VGA connected to the system and I have to use Xinerama with 2 independent monitors instead of TwinView.  Because of that I have 2 launchers (1 on each screen).\nIs there a way to make sure that only 1 launcher is started?\n\nA: You can apt-get install nvidia-settings and then run it as root (sudo nvidia-settings works fine). You can choose which twin monitor set up you want from there and then log in/out again (or otherwise restart X).\n\nA: I was able to achieve that but my setup is Twinview so I'm not sure if it will work for you.

The\n  most notable difference for the user is that any change manually done\n  to /etc/resolv.conf will be lost as it gets overwritten next time\n  something triggers resolvconf. Instead, resolvconf uses DHCP client\n  hooks, a Network Manager plugin and /etc/network/interfaces to\n  generate a list of nameservers and domain to put in /etc/resolv.conf.\n\n\"I use static IP configuration, where should I put my DNS configuration?\"\n\nThe DNS configuration for a static interface should go as\n  “dns-nameservers”, “dns-search” and “dns-domain” entries added to the\n  interface in /etc/network/interfaces\n\n\nTo try from Older method i.e. prior to Ubuntu 12.04 edition\n\nNOTE: Before you change your DNS settings to use Google Public DNS or\n  OpenDNS, be sure to backup the current server addresses or settings\n  somewhere.

This started happening when I updated to the latest version of Ubuntu.\nEDIT: The error I am getting when I don't have my external plugged in is 6e3b2d2e-84f4-45b69a81-2279cf411ea and the German message I got was Drucken Sie eine beliebige Taste, um non CD oder DVD zy starten..... Also I tried the command sudo blkid and rebooted without the external unplugged but still got the same error. \n\nA: It sounds like grub is installed on the internal drive and needs it's files on the external drive to work. You need to do two things, first install grub to the master boot record of the external drive - so that when you boot that drive you can choose to load ubuntu or windows. Second you need to boot the windows disc and repair the master boot record for the internal drive so that it automatically boots windows when the external drive is disconnected.\nThe first part I can help you with :\nBoot your Ubuntu system, open a terminal, then use the following commands to install grub to the external drive :\nsudo grub-install /dev/sdX\nsudo update-grub\n\nReplacing sdX with the actual drive, which will probably be sdb, but use disk utility to double check if you are unsure.\nThen you need to repair the master boot record of the internal drive to load windows automatically, boot your windows disc and it should be straight forward, but somebody else or google will help with that.\n:o)\n\nA: It seems, You have installed MBR on the Internal drive and boot files on the external hard drive. So, whenever grub wants boot files, it fails to load that, since they are on external drive.\nFollow this procedure:\n\n\n*\n\n*First boot your Ubuntu system from external drive. \n\n*Open a terminal, type this command to install grub on the external drive.\nsudo grub-install /dev/sda\nsudo update-grub\n\nThis will install mbr on the external hard drive and put the grub2's files in that drive. Replace, /dev/sda with the value of your external drive. You can see that by using command sudo blkid or sudo fdisk -l. If you see, your external drive as /dev/sdb, you should use that value instead of /dev/sda\n\n*Reboot after unpluggin the external drive, then put your Windows CD/DVD on it. and run the startup repair process. This will bring you Windows with it's Bootloader.\nNote: If you want to boot your Ubuntu from external drive, you need to select the external drive from BIOS menu, In my Laptop it is F12, then select external drive, It will bring you Ubuntu (grub) boot loader, which you can use to boot Ubuntu.\n\nSee this question for detailed help on restoring Windows\n", "Q: How to reenable Unity 3D after installing Bumblebee?

Is it possible to map a button to a notebook within the same program. Like say for instance I have a toolbar with a button on it. Can I link it to, say page 3, on the notebook widget?\nFor instance, I have a button on my toolbar. While I know how to map it to external programs, I am uncertain as to how I would map it to page 3 (an example in this case). I don't want to open another window (already can do that), but I do not know how to link it to something already in the program.\n\nA: Yes, it's possible to do.

I want to rewrite this on login because it keeps getting overwritten when I have it stored as space to disabled.\nWhere is this setting stored and how do I go about rewriting it?\n\nA: The keybindings are stored in GConf - /apps/gnome-do/preferences/Do/Platform/Common/AbstractKeyBindingService/.\nAlthough, since you've tagged this GNOME3, most likely your problem is that GNOME Shell claims the Super key, so Do can't bind to Super+Space.\nThe next version of Do will notify you when this is the case so you can change your keybinding to something that will work.\n", "Q: Unable to use package manager due to \"exclusive lock\" error My synaptic package manager in ubuntu is giving error:\n  Unable to get exclusive lock\n  This usually means that another package management application(like apt-get or  \n  aptitude) is already running. Please close that application first.\n\n\nA: I had interrupted a sudo apt-get upgrade, and I was unable to get a lock on anything. I simply fixed it by running sudo dpkg --configure -a, and it let me pick up where I left off. Dunno if it helps, might as well share.\n\nA: As mentioned in the other answer, you have to make sure that no other package management software is running.\nOpen a terminal and type the following command\nps aux | grep program-name\n\nwhere program-name can be apt, software etc. (just to find out if apt-get or Software Center are running). If you get entries for them, note down their process id. Let it be xxxx. Then give the following command.\nkill xxxx\n\nNow try opening synaptic.\nIf the problem still persists, give the following command in the terminal,\nsudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock\n\nNow synaptic should hopefully open.\n\nA: This error means that anoher Package Management Software is already running and using the files which for example contain the sources for the software. I would look for working processes like apt-get or aptitude with the system-monitor and exit them. Than restart synaptic and it should work.\n\nA: I had the same problem. This post helped however, the pa aux command and the Kill command were ineffective. sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock seemed to work, and I followed it up by another Linux post.\n\n  \n*\n  \n*You need sudo rights, so the full command is:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\n  \n*Try using Konsole terminal program instead. Make sure that all package managers are closed! Issue the commands:\nsudo apt-get update  \nsudo apt-get upgrade\n\n\nThe sudo apt-get update command worked.\nThe sudo apt-get upgrade one did not as it stated could not get dns proxy.\nAlso the following came up:\nsome files failed to upload using old files.\n\nAt least the update was able to fetch 39 of them. The other is irrelevant as this is the latest Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit.\n", "Q: How do I Install graphic drivers for a radeon xpress200?

I use tilda as my drop-down terminal.\nSuppose, I enter a command in terminal and than I have to make a quick search of the result of the command's output. Let's suppose the output resulted in an error. Now, currently what I do is select the complete error and than right-click copy to copy the contents which I believe is not a effecient way.\nSo, while reading on internet I came accross that there is a PRIMARY CLIPBOARD feature in which whatever is under selection is copied.\nMy question is how do I enable this feature in my terminal(tilda or gnome) only or is this something in-built by default. If yes how to use it.\nI want this feature only for my terminal and not for rest of all my applications if it is possible.\n\nA: I'm not sure I understand your question, but if you just want a more efficient way to copy and paste, you can probably use ctrl+shift+c to copy from the tilda terminal to the clipboard.\n\nA: Any selected text is automatically copied to the primary selection (default x behavior). All you have to do is to klick the _middle_button_ (2nd mouse button) in order to copy the text somewhere else. If your mouse does not come with a middle klick, you have to configure a substitute (some key, simultanous klick of left+right mouse button, tab with two fingers on touchpad). \n", "Q: Dowloaded Wubi.exe but it doesn't run on my asus 1005p ee pc running windows 7 I want to install ubuntu 12.04 LTS along side windows 7 on my Asus 1005P Eee PC. I tried to install it with the Live USB created with the \"Universal-USB-Installer-1.9.0.2.exe\" but failed. Alternatively, I downloaded the \"wubi.exe\" installer from www.ubuntu.com, but it does not run on my pc.   Is this version of ubuntu incompatible for the given hardware for side by side installation with windows 7?  \n\nA: Solved the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS installation problem on my ASUS 1005P Eee PC Netbook.\nTurns out when I purchased the Netbook it came with 4 partitions (C: D: and 2 Hidden partions) all of them were set as primary drives. Therefore, while attempting to install Ubuntu 12.04 from the Live USB I would get the option to \"install Ubuntu inside Windows 7\" instead of \"install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7\" and on continuing with the wizard the system will just reboot.\nThen I shrunk the C drive using Windows disk management utility and tried installing Ubuntu onto the un-allocated space from the Live USB, but the installation wizard indicated that the unallocated space was not usable.\nSo I installed EASEUS Partition Master and used it to convert D drive to 'logical' as the C drive contained the Windows boot loader.\nThereafter, when I ran the Live USB it showed the \"install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7\" option and I was able to install Ubuntu 12.04 LTS alongside Windows 7 without any problems.\n", "Q: Is virtuoso-t restarting indexing after every boot? virtuoso-t is indexing my files again, which takes a massively long time with all my CD's ripped to flac and converted to mp3 and ogg, not to mention all other files on the system.\n PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  P COMMAND\n3416 jhendrix  39  19  508m 142m 5060 R 99.1  1.8  47:10.40 1 virtuoso-t\n\nWhy is it indexing all files again? My PC sounds like a vacuum cleaner right now. I know I can kill the process, but I want to know why it is happening.\n\nA: As for my experiene - virtuoso-t takes so much cpu only until it index all the files. Once it happened - it behaves calmly. I suggest You to leave Your computer turned on for the night.\nAlso You might control the memory used by virtuoso-t.\nAnd finally You coould have it broken.

For that I'd suggest You to remove all nepomuk related folders in ~/.kde.\n", "Q: What happened to my KDE task bar? How can I get it back?

There are something like tabs in that launcher, the first named \"Search and launch\", the second \"Page one\".\nHow can I get the usual KDE desktop back?\n\nA: It sounds like you somehow got the KDE \"netbook\" interface, assuming it looks like this:\nhttp://www.kde.org/workspaces/plasmanetbook/\nYou can switch the workspace under System Settings -> Workspace -> workspace type; set it to \"desktop\".

One of the reasons for this is to help protect you from malicious programs (or non-malicious programs that you just don't want to run by accident).\nIf you're sure /home/neil/Downloads/desura is safe for you to run, then you can enable execute permissions for it.\nCommand Line Way\nRun this command in a terminal:\nchmod +x /home/neil/Downloads/desura\n\nYou probably already own the file, so you should not need to run that command with sudo.\nGraphical Way\nIn Nautilus (the file browser), find desura in your Downloads folder, and right-click on it. Click Properties.\n\nClick the Permissions tab, and check the box labeled Allow executing file as program. Then click Close.\n\nA: check the ownership of the file. \nls -la <file-name>\n\nYou should be the owner of the file and have execute permission\n", "Q: Why am I not able to install a lot of programs from the software center?

It should have a place to allow certain ports to be passed through to the computers listening for that port, and often has easy configuration for common ports such as HTTP, SSH, FTP, etc.  Web pages normally listen on port 80, by default, although this can be changed (but would require a special URL specifying the port). \nThe feature to allow connections to local computers is called \"Port Forwarding\".  It is router specific, so you need to connect to your router and either find it, or look through the manual.\nIt's best not to allow all requests to be passed, but to only enable specific protocols such as HTTP on port 80.\nIf you're completely new to this, you might find this article helpful.\nEdit - How to find the admin settings\nIn order to change the settings rather than simply viewing them, you must log in as \"admin\".  According to the manual, the way to do this is to enter the ip address in your browser (192.168.1.1), and log in as \"admin\", with the default password \"admin\".  But if this router is is from your ISP, they may have changed the password.  If this is the case, you may need to search forums for your ISP to find the password, unless they will tell you what it is (good luck with that - they may disallow servers).\n", "Q: How do I add an icon to the unity dock (not drag and drop)?

That means running it like this:\n. ~/.bashrc\n\nIt's effectively the same as typing all the command into the shell you are running it from and has the effect of changing the environment of the running shell (which doesn't happen if it's run as a sub-process).\n\nA: That page is giving you bad advice. You should not put those lines in ~/.bashrc. Exports should be in ~/.profile only. The default ~/.profile already adds ~/bin to PATH (if ~/bin exists), so you don't need to repeat that one. Thus: \n\n\n*\n\n*Remove the lines you added to ~/.bashrc\n\n*Add the line export SWIFT_TEST_CONFIG_FILE=/etc/swift/test.conf to ~/.profile\n\n*Log out and back in again (~/.profile is read when you log in)\n\n\nSee http://mywiki.wooledge.org/DotFiles for more.\n", "Q: Correctly packaging for /opt with dh_make I know, this has already been asked a few times, but it doesn't seem to cover my case yet.\nI'm trying to package a Mono-application to run from /opt.\nFirst, I tried these guides:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PackagingGuide/Mono\n\n*http://developer.ubuntu.com/2012/02/how-to-prepare-a-compiled-application-for-ubuntu-software-center/\nBut they don't seem to do the job.\nThe problem I see is that dh_make doesn't seem to like building packages that are installed in /opt. It always applies its own prefix to the path (/usr/) and puts the files in the usual directorys (bin/share/lib). But what I want is a flat layout just as I have it usually when building directly with MonoDevelop.\nHow can I do that with dh_make? do I have to create the debian/rules file manually to force installation to /opt?\n\nA: The packaging produced by dh_make should just be considered a starting point. In all but the most straight forward cases, you'll need to edit some of the files. In order to install to /opt, you'll need to set an install prefix. Assuming that you are using an autotools build system, your debian/rules file might look like:\n#!/usr/bin/make -f\n\n%:\n    dh $@ --with cli\n\noverride_dh_auto_configure:\n    dh_auto_configure -- --prefix=/opt/my_program\n\n", "Q: I am having trouble booting 12.04 keyboard and little man in circle appears and then nothing I have a new system (ASUS 990FX mother board, 2 western dig drives, 32 gb memory, an ASUS nvidia video card (GeForce GTX560), and an ASUS DVD Burner (24B1ST)) I am struggling to get the 12.04 cd to work.

I successfully loaded Ubuntu 12.04 from CD to run along with Windows 7, then I clicked the install icon. It asked me which option I would like to proceed with, and I answered Ubuntu, in Windows 7. It did everything rather quickly, and restarted itself. Upon restarting itself it ejected the CD, and I thought everything was good to go.\nIt brought me to the Option to either load Ubuntu or Windows, I was thinking to myself, \"wow, that was a lot easier than I thought.\" Windows 7 loaded fine after it checked the HDD.\nHowever, when I went to load Ubuntu, it brings me to the loading screen and then stays there for a long period time.

If you need me to go back and get the full message and put it up here I will. Anyhow, if I put the CD in it loads fine.\n\nA: As you are new with Ubuntu, then I think Wubi is the best option for you.

I looked at the other post and it said to switch to bridged adapter which I did, and to no avail did it work. I tried updating the virtual box only driver for windows, but again no solution.\n\nA: I'm sorry, your description is so vague that I can only guess what you mean. You have a Windows host with VirtualBox installed and set up a guest machine that is running Ubuntu. You want to connect to that machine from the host via SSH, by using PuTTY, the most popular remote terminal client on Windows. Is that right?\nFor that to work you need to have the SSH server package installed in the guest system (sudo apt-get install openssh-server). You should also configure the ssh server, so that you know which port to use to connect to the server and which authentication method to use (using you user password is fine as long as you're just trying things out), at least. Second step is to configure port forwarding between host and guest OS. The default network configuration uses NAT, which is - contrary to outdated information - fine, just click port forwarding and set up a rule.\nHere is an example for connecting to a webserver running in a virtual machine. I can access the websever in the VM listening at port 80 with a browser from the host system by visiting the address consisting of host IP and host port. Note: I've chosen port 8080 because the host is running a webserver too.\n\n", "Q: Boot an up-to-date Ubuntu linux OS from cdrom or dvd I want to take my current, up-to-date Ubuntu OS on my laptop,  put it on a cdrom or dvd, and boot diskless from the cdrom or dvd,  saving any data I accumulate to USB memory stick.  \nIs there a way to deconstruct the Ubuntu Live cdroms and  add in the current .deb files to do this? \nPerhaps a ram disk in memory to install into?\n\nA: In general, the answer is yes, and depending on what you know about building a live system or even a bootable CD you can call it \"horribly complex\" or \"pretty easy\".\nThe issue is that the liveCD / CD installer must be usable on just any piece of hardware. It needs to check the hardware, recognize it, and select the appropriate drivers, and then produce the apropriate configuration files for your system to boot up. Therefore this liveCD system cannot be simply the image of your running system, where this has already happened during installation.\nThere are several tools in debian / Ubuntu systems that allow you to create such CD images. What one does is to create a folder, and within that folder make a complete, customized Ubuntu install, including, for example, any additional packages, specific config files etc.\nA detailed guide can be found here.\n\nA: Have a look on RemasterSys . It can backup your system as ISO\n", "Q: Save to Hard Drive instead of bootable USB I followed the instructions on the Ubuntu website on how to put Ubuntu 12.04 on a USB and make it a bootable USB stick for windows. \nIt worked fine and I can boot up and run Ubuntu, but every time I try to download software or change settings it tries to save it to the USB rather than the hard drive built into the computer. \nThe USB doesn't have enough space so the download fails and in addition it doesn't retain setting changes so when I restart my computer all the settings return to default and anything I saved is gone. \nIs there any way to change things so that when I download software or change settings Ubuntu will save it to my hard drive instead of the USB?\n\nA: Try this, Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command below.\nwget location of file/name of file -P ./LOCAL-DIR \n\nExample, if you want to download file stuff.deb from http://mysite.com, and save it to /home/user/download, you would do \nwget http://mysite.com/stuff.deb.exe -P ./home/user/download\n\n\nA: When the live USB is created with persistence, your settings should be saved from session to session.  With a 4G stick, you should be able to have a 3G persistence file to save anything of yours, and even some system parts.  UEFI machines have a problem with persistence (but 1159016) but you can manually fix it (see the bug).  Running from USB, you will be able to mount a hard disk partition, and write to it, but think about how you want to use the data you download.  Do you want to see it from the Windows OS also?  In that case, leave the filesystem on the mounted partition ntfs.  If you only want to use the data from Ubuntu, you may make the filesystem ext4.  Make a little script for the mount command.  The live USB persistence does not allow updates to the kernel, and fstab was another file that could not be changed (last time I looked).  If /etc/fstab could be successfully persisted, you could put the mount command there and have it automatically performed at startup.  \n", "Q: Can I set a custom horizontal width for a Gnome panel? Is there some way to specify a custom size for a Gnome panel? I'm using Gnome Classic on ubuntu 12.04. There is an \"expand\" option, but I want to exactly specify the size of the panel. I'm not talking about the height, but rather the width of a horizontal panel.\n\nA: Unfortunately, there is no way to set a custom horizontal width for a Gnome Panel. The best you can do is disable the \"expand\" property, and let it adjust to the size of its contents; you can also change the \"x-centered\" property to center the panel or keep it on the left.\nThis can be done with dconf-editor (install dconf-tools), with the settings found in top-panel or bottom-panel under (see top panel in screenshot):\norg->gnome->gnome-panel->layout->toplevels\n\n", "Q: Can not get Ubuntu 12.04 to sleep or suspend on Toshiba Satellite L35 Suspend works OK in Windows XP on this computer, but not in Ubuntu 12.04.\n\nA: I had your symptoms on a HP 2000 laptop, without the Windows.

It's probably something easy to do, but I have been unable to find where to auto-adjust the position. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: Generally this is caused by how you are creating your layout. It sounds like you are using a fixed layout (as your top-level layout) which will make it much more difficult to do. \nThe best thing to do is to create a fluid layout by starting your layout with a GtkBox within your GtkWindow. Much like this: \n\nThis will make your layout fluid and allow for your text to become centered within your window. If you have to remain with a fixed layout, you'll have to attempt to center the label problematically. \nIf you are using a GridLayout, I believe you'll need to turn on \"Horizontal Expand\" on the label to get it to fill the unused cell space. However, its been awhile, so don't hold me to that.\n", "Q: How does apt-get/aptitude update determine what package lists to update? The context is a bug in which Ubuntu are updating package list timestamps every 30 minutes on their archive mirrors, which forces [apt-get|aptitude] update commands to download package lists though they haven't changed:\n\n\n*\n\n*the size of apt-get update lists is too big\n\n*http://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+bug/1001780\nThe proposed workaround is to run touch over the affected index files prior to running apt-get update.  This make their timestamps current, and avoids having to re-download them.  This speeds processing by up to several minutes (2-3 seconds vs. 2-6 minutes in various tests).  This despite running a local apt-cache-ng proxy.\nWe're running into this testing (mostly) and deploying (somewhat) Ubuntu-based images for our AWS infrastructure in which apt-get update runs a couple of times.  3-6 minutes vs. 3-20 seconds makes a big difference in our iteration time.\nIt seems odd to me that apt doesn't rely on filesize or hashes to determine whether or not files have changed.  Timestamps are very trivially modified, and seem awfully brittle to base this behavior on.\n\nA: When I first tested the touch hack, I was surprised that apt-get used the local file mod time to inform the http server what to download--but that's obviously the case (or the hack wouldn't work).\nThe downloaded Release file contains a reliable date and these files are crytographically signed, and are therefore quite trustworthy, but the hashes aren't used to determine what package files to download.\nWith the timestamp approach now in use for package files, there's nothing special needed from the mirror site. We owe the Debian project for the design. It's helpful to mirror owners to keep Ubuntu identical to Debian and keep things vanilla and therefore easy to manage.\nThis design normally works fine, as far as I know. This is just a bug which should be fixed as far as I'm concerned, but the bug is in Canonical private code so outsiders like me can't help patch it. I hope they do so soon as we are abusing the hospitality of those running Ubuntu mirrors, in addition to causing unnecessary expense for some Ubuntu users who must pay for bandwidth by the gigabyte.\nThere is an http protocol mechanism for using an etag to represent a served item, but it's not used for apt-get. Such a tag could contain the hash from the Release file.\nIt's the large number of packages included in Ubuntu releases which make this bug so significant.\nFrom the signed (and therefore checksummed) Release, there are hashes for these files, and in these files hashes for versions of packages and from there checksums for files. Since the package files contain the version numbers, and since they don't change, the bug doesn't cause redundant package upgrades.\n", "Q: How to save my certified Ubuntu 11.10 which came with the computer I have bought a computer with Ubuntu 11.10 and now I need to install Windows XP alonside it. Is it possible to save my certified Ubuntu configuration onto a usb stick, then unistall Ubuntu, install Windows and reinstall Ubuntu?\nIf so, can you tell me, how to do it? \nThanks for any hints without using complicated terminology.\n\nA: View months ago, i used DAR to backup my whole Linux partion.

After the dar file is created you can save it on a USB-Dongle/HDD.\nYou can install the DAR  package with:\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install dar\n\n\nA: As your Ubuntu root Partition may be ext4, you should use fsarchiver.\nIt's a great commande line tool that will save and compress the content of a partition into an archive file.\nWhen you are done you will be able to restore your archive in a new partition with different size without problem.\nI advise you to use it from a liveCD although liveBackup is possible\n", "Q: How do I cancel a time-delayed  screenshot? I'm using the default screenshot application that comes with Ubuntu gnome-screenshot\nWhen I was using it earlier to take screenshots of the lock screen I had set a long time delay, but forgot to change it back after I'd finished. When I next took a timed screenshot I had to wait a long time for it to take because the delay was still set so long. \nClicking the icon to relaunch the screenshot application has no effect whilst the timer is in effect, I imagine there is probably a simple terminal command to shut down an application, but I don't know it! Is there a way to do this?\n\nA: The one-liner you're looking for is:\nkill `pidof gnome-screenshot`\n\n\npidof is preferable here compared to pgrep, killall and some invocations of ps, which only consider the first 15 characters of a command name and can choke on hyphens. Be careful not to kill the similarly prefixed gnome-screensaver if you use these..\n\n\nA: Step1. Looking for the process numbers of gnome-screenshot by ps ax command in the terminal.\nStep2.

I want to setup a SMTP server to receive all mails.\nI have only found mail sending software so far (like postfix).\nBut I want to have software to make the server being able to receive mails.\nBonus points if it could work like temporary mailsites, like mailinator.com (I know, but no DNS MX forwarding advice please) and fakemailgenerator.com.\n\nA: You should definitely try iRedMail\n\n\n*\n\n*Deploy full-featured mail server in LESS THAN 1 MINUTE, low maintenance after deployed.\n\n*Unlimited number of virtual mail domains, users, mail lists, aliases, admins.\n\n\nJust download, extract and run the script.\nInstallation guide\n\nA: Postfix, Exim, Sendmail and the rest are Mail Transfer Agents and can act as a Mail Submission Agent, Mail Exchange, Mail Transfer Agent, and Mail Delivery Agent.  Given the proper cofiguration they will both send and receive email.  (If you want to run your own  Mail Exchange (MX) server you need a fixed address, and should get your IP address provider to configure your PTR address with your mail servers domain name.)\nHowever, to retrieve email from a service like mailinator you need a program like fetchmail which will read mail from an inbox and pass it to your local MSA (Mail Submission Agent).  The trick with a service like mailinator could be to configure pick up addresses dynamically. \n", "Q: How can I cleanup a botched Truecrypt installation? I made the mistake of downloading the X64 version of Truecrypt and trying to install it when I'm actually running the 32-bit version of Precise Pangolin.\nI want to clean up the files that I am unable to use, but of course I can't just run the uninstall since Truecrypt could not be installed in the first place.\nI am new to this but I have spent some time researching the command line.\nWhen I run \"locate trucrypt -i\" in the terminal I receive several relevant files in the usr/bin and usr/share directories. No \"rm\" commands work on these listed files--I only get \"no such file or directory\" back. I'm sure this has something to do with permissions but I don't know what I'm missing here.\nWhy is it I cannot find these files through the GUI (even when I select \"show hidden files\") or when I try to navigate to these files via the terminal using cd and ls commands?\nHow can I remove these files (they are there aren't they?), one way or another, from my system?\nYour patience and time are appreciated\n\nA: The locate command stores the list of files in a database. So those files could have been deleted, but still show up in the \"locate\" output. Enter the command sudo updatedb to update the database, then run your locate command again.\n\nA: TrueCrypt doesn't do a very complex installation - no databases are modified when installing. The installation process consists of extracting a bunch of files, and the uninstallation process consists of deleting all those files.\nIf typing sudo truecrypt-uninstall.sh doesn't fix it, just run this series of commands:\nsudo rm -f /usr/bin/truecrypt*\nsudo rm -f /usr/share/applications/truecrypt*\nsudo rm -f /usr/share/pixmaps/truecrypt*\nsudo rm -rf /usr/share/truecrypt/\n\nAfter that, you may want to reboot (although it might not be necessary,) and then continue with your installation like normal!\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 amd64 kernel 3.5 and fglrx Does anyone know how to install fglrx with the 3.5.x kernel?\nI can live with gallium, an I don't mind dual booting, but I would really love to see better 3D acceleration!\n\nA: Good news i finally manage to install then with no errors i just download the quantal prebuild packages from here and everything worked ok no patching needed!\n", "Q: In SSH, how do I mv to my local system? I ssh-ed into my webhost's directory, and tar-ed the webapp to download. When I try to mv to ~/mydirectory/backups or /home/mydirectory/backups, it defines the \"home\" as my root on the webhost that I'm ssh'ed into.\nHow do I mv in ssh to a local drive while still being inside the webhost's system?\n\nA: I had the same problem. Here's the easy solution:-\n\n\n*\n\n*Open nautilus (the file explorer)\n\n*Click on + Other Locations at bottom of left panel.\n\n*At the bottom there's a strip Connect to server. Write the ssh address in the input box such as ssh://111.222.333.444/.\n\n*Enter your user name and password in the dialogue box that will open.\n\n*Upon successful authentication you will be at home of remote location. Feel free to move file here and there.\n\n\nA: The other answers recommend rsync or scp, both of which require you to know the location of the file you want to copy on the remote machine.\nIf you instead want to be able to poke around on the remote machine, like you can with ssh, you want to run sftp.  Logging into the server is very similar to ssh, but once you get in, type help to get the list of commands - it lets you move yourself around on both the local and remote machines, and transfer files back and forth easily.\n\nA: It's strange to that it's impossible from inside ssh. In a regular terminal, one could send/receive files using zmodem commands. \nThis helped to google up zssh: http://zssh.sourceforge.net/. One will have to run it as a wrapper to original ssh.\n\nA: First things first: ssh is a way to remotely login to another computer. The shell (command line) you get after you ssh is (pretty much) the same as if you had opened a xterm in the remote machine. If offers no such way to move files.\nHowever, the fact that the remote computer accepts ssh connections gives you some options to exchange files:\nUse scp\nTo copy from your local computer to the remote, type, in the local computer:\nscp /tmp/file user@example.com:/home/name/dir\n(where /tmp/file can be replaced with any local file and /home/name/dir with any remote directory)\nTo copy from the remote computer to the local one, type, in the local computer:\nscp user@example.com:/home/name/dir/file /tmp\nUse sshfs\nThis is a little more advanced but much, much nicer (when the internet connection of both computers is good. If not, stick to scp)\nYou can \"link\" a directory from the remote computer to an (empty) directory of the local computer. Say you \"link\" the /some/remote/dir from the remote computer to /home/youruser/remotecomp in your computer. If there is a file /some/remote/dir/file in the remote computer, you can see it on /home/youruser/remotecomp/file. You can copy and mv as usual, and you can even alter remote files and dirs.\nNote however, that when the connection ends, /home/youruser/remotecomp becomes an empty dir again, and you only keep in the local computer the files you copied to other directories\nTo achieve this:\n\n*\n\n*install sshfs:\n\nsudo apt-get install sshfs\n\n\n*create a empty dir\n\nmkdir /home/youruser/remotecomp\n\n\n*\"link\" the two directories (the right term is mount)\n\nsshfs user@server.com:/some/remote/dir /home/youruser/remotecomp\n\n\n*Enjoy\n\n\n*\"unlink\" the dirs\nfusermount -u /home/youruser/remotecomp\nIf the local computer runs windows\nYou can find versions of scp for windows. See, e.g, winscp\nRsync\nrsync is a utility to copy files that can:\n\n*\n\n*resume transfers\n\n*redo a transfer, but only send the files that changed.\n\nTo copy a single file, you can use rsync -P -e ssh /tmp/file user@example.com:/home/name/dir\nTo keep a directory in sync, sending only the needed files, you can use rsync -avzh /home/yourname/dir_name user@example.com:/var/temp/\nThere are also many other options, including deleting files in the remote dir if they no longer exist in the local dir.\nThis option is a bit harder. For example, you can mess up with trailing slashes (note that, in the last command, dir_name had no trailing slash, but /var/temp/ had). So it is useful, but requires a bit of testing and/or man rsync\nAs always, commands are run in the local computer, not the remote one\n\nA: You can either use scp or rsync. In your local system:\nscp remoteuser@remotehost:/remote/dir/file /local/dir/\nBut, since you mentioned backup, I assume that it would be incremental and you'll need to do it every now and then. So, rsync is a better choice for incremental backup. On your local shell:\nrsync -avz -e ssh remoteuser@remotehost:/remote/dir /local/dir/\nsee rsync(1)and scp(1) man pages for options.\n\nA: You could use scp secure copy.\nFrom you local shell:\nscp -C username@webhost:/path/of-the/tar.archive /home/mydirectory/backups/\n\nThis example will copy via ssh from /path/of-the/tar.archive of your webhost to /home/mydirectory/backups/\nExtra options:\n-C: Enables compression\n\nA: I realise this is old, but still relevant.\nA good solution is to use fish:// via dolphin (from KDE's Plasma), put the ssh server details like this in the file-location box (ie address bar) of dolphin file manager -- you might have to change the default settings to reveal the location bar:\nfish://username@example.com:2200\n\nwhere username is your username on the remote computer, example.com is the domain of the computer (or IP address, like 202.123.4.2) and after the colon is the port number (default is 22, but the remote server may be set with a different port number; and should be).\nYou'll get asked for the password (unless you've set up an SSH key; which is a good idea) and when accepted you'll have a tab in dolphin that you can use like any other tab. Moving files from one dolphin window or tab is done by drag-dropping the files as you would if they were all local. IME this is a really easy way to do things.\nI also have used krusader for the same sort of thing, except it has told to help you synchronise file changes between different folders (locally or remotely).\nThis blog post has images and some extra info on using fish.\n", "Q: Quickly add Scrolling to Window while creating my ubuntu application, I wanted to add in several images and then allow the user to scroll through them.

I think it's caused by accessing super user (if not wrong). I type sudo nautilus to put a background to burg, but i fail x_x. After reboot, i can't login to desktop. But i can login as guest. I had 'googling' for problem solving. Most of it is login to screen like terminal (maybe tty console) by pressing ctrl+alt+F1. But after i login system says: \n-bash: /usr/bin/byobu/-launch: no such file or directory\n\nhelp help help :(\n\nA: Looks like byobu has added some broken code to your .profile file.

In order for me to read my comics on my PSP i need to convert them into jpg format. The official format of my comics is cbz, and i cant convert online because all the comics are about 7 gigabytes.\n\nA: .cbz files are actually a zip file with jpgs or pngs in it.\nChange the file extension from cbz to zip, uncompress the file with Archive Manager, then you'll be shown a bunch of image files!\n\nA: Assuming your file name is sample.cbz, just:\n7z x sample.cbz -osample\nimage files would be extracted into sample directory.\n", "Q: Will Wubi work on a Truecrypt Full Disk Encryption Windows partition? I have a windows machine using Truecrypt 7.1a FDE. I would like to use wubi to install Ubuntu within windows. Will doing this cause any issues with my system booting up? From what I understand Wubi does not modify any bootloaders. All it does is modify some boot settings within windows. So in theory the Truecrypt custom bootloader will remain the same, and after I get through the truecrypt prompt, have the option of windows or Ubuntu right?\n\nA: Sorry, not possible with Full Disk Encryption\nIt will not cause any issues...until after you select the \"Wubi\" entry on the boot menu. Wubi will not boot, complaining about a missing root.disk.\nThis happens because Wubi-Ubuntu does not have the Truecrypt driver necessary to access the underlying encrypted NTFS disk (which contains its root.disk).\n\nA: I am using a fully encrypted windows and as usual wubi lives inside the windows disk. and it boots up without problem. \n", "Q: x11 Remote Desktop with Ubuntu 12.04 When I was running Debian, I was able to start a remote session over x11 by just typing gnome-session\nHowever, with Ubuntu 12.04, this only seems to result in my desktop and background being forwarded over x11 -- the top bar (where the clock is) and dock are both missing. I tried starting all of unity by executing unity, but that just resulted in a segfault.\nHow can I start a Unity 2D session over x11?\nEdit: I prefer x11 as I need to tunnel the connection over 2 other servers. I would need to do a good amount of port forwarding within SSH to get any other connections back. Of course, if someone has any other suggestions, I'm willing to listen.\n\nA: I got it working with:\ngnome-session --session=ubuntu-2d\n\nThis will automatically start unity-2d-panel and unity-2d-shell.\n\nA: In order to make this a slightly more forward compatible, I'll add that you can find the sessions in /usr/share/gnome-session/sessions/. You'll see files like ubuntu-2d.session, gnome-classic.session, etc. You'll then use gnome-session --session=ubuntu-2d. In other words, you'll just drop the \".session\" from the name. \n\nA: I had the same problem on an esxi-server. With ubuntu-2d session it doesn't work. So I have defined in .xsession file gnome-session --session=gnome-classic. \nBe sure the file gnome-classic.session exist in /usr/gnome-session/sessions.\n\nA: Looks like one solution is just to install gnome-classic and use that:\nInstall gnome-panel:\nsudo apt-get install gnome-panel\n\nStart gnome-fallback session:\ngnome-session-fallback\n\nIt works, it's fast, quick, and functional.

I do not want to upgrade the Ubuntu version. \nIt seems that some of the supporting libraries such as lib6 are old. I would like to know how I can update them so as to make Wine 1.5 available.\nUpdate: After adding the PPA, I was able to get Wine 1.4, even though Synaptic Software Manager listed it as 1.3. The reason I wanted the latest wine was to install the Encyclopedia Britannica DVD. I got it installed in Windows and started using the installation folder from Wine. Prior to that, I had to run Windows flash installer in Wine. So, this problem is already solved.\n\nA: Maverick is already EOL.\nThe Official Wine PPA offers Wine 1.3 for Maverick, 1.5 and 1.4 are for Oneiric and Precise Only, dependencies and all.\nI suppose installing from source could be an option otherwise you'll have to upgrade.\n\n\n*\n\n*http://www.winehq.org/docs/wineusr-guide/installing-wine-source/\n", "Q: Does anyone know how to connect to a terminal services gateway using a RDP V6 compatible client in Ubuntu 12.04?

I will explain how to do this for both Chrome and Chromium. These two browsers are mostly the same, but you can check out the differences here.\nChrome\nFirst you have to install the key. This can be done by opening Terminal and typing\nwget -q -O - https://dl-ssl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | sudo apt-key add -\n\nStep two is to add the repository\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"deb http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main\" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list'\nThen you update and, if you haven't already, install Google Chrome\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install google-chrome-stable\n\nChromium\nChromium is more straight forward.

So how to I accomplish this? \nSuggestions or alternate solutions are welcome. Thanks in advance.\n\nA: You can specify a umask in transmission's config file (/etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json). Umask we normally represent in octal, but unfortunately, json does not support that, so we have to convert it to base 10. You can do this in the shell like this:\n$ echo $(( 8#022 ))\n18\n\nThat's the default, but you probably want 002, which is the same in decimal, so\nsudo editor /etc/transmission-daemon/settings.json\n# change \"umask\": 18 to \"umask\": 2 and save\nsudo reload transmission-daemon # tells transmission-daemon to re-read the config \n                                # file. This is important, otherwise, the changes\n                                # will be lost\n\nAnother thing. If you change the group ownership of the download dir, and add the setgid bit on it, all files created in that directory will have the same group ownership as that directory.\nsudo chgrp \"$USER\" /path/to/transmission/download/dir\nsudo chmod g+s /path/to/transmission/download/dir\n\nIt will not affect files that already exist.

What are the pitfalls?\nI preferably would not like to use closed binary blob drivers.\nusecase scenario:\nI'm writing a piece of software that has to interact with other systems.\nI would like to be able to see all of those systems, my code, lots of log files and\ndocumentation without the need to swap windows/screens. To just better see what im doing. \nUPDATE\nI recently updated to ubuntu 14.04 and my radeon HD7880 with six mini hd outputs just worked out of the box without manual binary driver downloads etc. hardeware acceleration worked to! YAY!\n\nA: I have a 3 monitor rig working with both blob and OSS drivers(blob performance is marginally better and supports opencl much better).  That's not a solution to a six monitor quandry.  \nDual monitors cards with 2 triplehead2gos should be more than adequate to achieve 6 monitor screen real-estate.  \n\nA: You could try an ATI Radeon HD 5870 Eyefinity 6 card or similar.  Being a single card, it should be easier to configure.\nThe card requires that your monitors support DisplayPort, or that you use active DisplayPort to DVI/VGA dongles.  This is because the card can not drive the clocks for 6 individual outputs, and DisplayPort doesn't require separate clocks for each port.\n\nA: I have wasted two years trying to get a six screen setup working. \nWhat I have\n3 GeForce GTX 550 Ti cards  \nWhat I use:\n• LXDE with KDM\n• Nvidia 310.14 driver  \nRun each screen as separate x display.\nI could only get twinview working for two displays.\nUse xinerama to create one big desktop. \nWhat works:\n• spanned wallpaper one panel for all the screens (one big desktop)\n• maximise window over one screen, not all six  \nNot working:\n• 3D hardware acceleration on the desktop (I can actually play some games with a bit of tweaking)\n• xrandr generates errors\n• compiz is right out\n• unity had horrible multi-monitor support the last time I checked (anything more than two screens and it goes pear shaped.  \nMy xorg.conf file:\n# nvidia-settings: X configuration file generated by nvidia-settings\n# nvidia-settings:  version 310.14  (buildd@komainu)  Tue Oct 16 22:20:47 UTC 2012\n\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n     Identifier     \"Layout0\"\n     Screen      0  \"Screen0\" 0 0\n     Screen      1  \"Screen1\" 0 1080\n     Screen      2  \"Screen2\" 1920 0\n     Screen      3  \"Screen3\" 1920 1080\n     Screen      4  \"Screen4\" 3840 0\n     Screen      5  \"Screen5\" 3840 1080\n     InputDevice    \"Keyboard0\" \"CoreKeyboard\"\n     InputDevice    \"Mouse0\" \"CorePointer\"\n     Option         \"Xinerama\" \"1\" EndSection\n\nSection \"Files\" EndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n     # generated from default\n     Identifier     \"Mouse0\"\n     Driver         \"mouse\"\n     Option         \"Protocol\" \"auto\"\n     Option         \"Device\" \"/dev/psaux\"\n     Option         \"Emulate3Buttons\" \"no\"\n     Option         \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5\" EndSection\n\nSection \"InputDevice\"\n     # generated from default\n     Identifier     \"Keyboard0\"\n     Driver         \"kbd\" EndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n     # HorizSync source: edid, VertRefresh source: edid\n     Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\n     VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n     ModelName      \"Samsung SMB2330H\"\n     HorizSync       30.0 -

Those cards are extremely silent and you can attach six monitors.\nFor monitors I would use the Dell UltraSharp U2312HM. Those are really inexpensive but have an IPS-Panel and all the inputs you need.\nI currently run four of those with the GPU equivalent from the 6xxx series. It's running perfectly, although the closed source driver is causing some flickering.\nSince last week I'm running the Ubuntu daily image because of the 3.11 kernel, which is featuring the new AMD open source driver. Since then the flickering problem is gone and this setup really runs perfectly. \nThere should be no problems running this with as many monitors as you like, as long as you can attach them to one card. Unfortunately the open source driver isn't supporting crossfire, but maybe this could also work across multiple cards without crossfire.\nJust for clarification, I'm running a stock Ubuntu 13.10 daily. In my opinion Unity is the best System for multi-monitoring.\n\nA: I got six monitors working in Ubuntu 14.04 by using a GeForce GT 640 and a GeForce GT 740. I'm using the Nvidia 331.113 binary drivers. I was able to configure the cards with the Nvidia X Server Settings app. I had to add a second \"screen\" in my \"server layout\" which I did with that settings app.\nUpdate Jan 8, 2015: I now have 7 monitors (including a 4K and with capability for an 8th) running on two video cards (GTX 970 and GT 740) in an Asus Z170-K motherboard. I'm using Ubuntu 14.04.03 with XFCE and the 958 Nvidia driver package from https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa (Steam crashes on 358, 352 is recommended). Note that Gnome did not handle multiple X screens well but XFCE handles three X screens like a champ. I have a left screen for two monitors on the GT 740, a middle screen for the 4K and two monitors on the GTX 970 and a right screen for the two remaining monitors on the GT 740. It's a little goofy when I start up so I have a run an xrandr command to adjust the positioning of the middle three monitors. I'm not an X guru and only have a couple years of Linux experience so this took me quite a few hours of messing around. If you don't want this to be a hobby, and don't hate Windows, then go with Windows.\nThe beauty of a multi-card setup is that you can build it up over time and  phase in newer (and more common) parts as you need them.\n\nA: I have been running 6 monitors for about 3 years and have not had any problems I run a amd vega 64 card with 3 hdmi and 3 display ports the only draw back I have had is sometimes you don't know what screen a program will come up on I am running xubuntu currently but even with the default ubuntu there has been no problem I just plugged them in configured their physical arrangement and it just works\n\nA: Windows.\nIf you can afford 6 Monitors you can afford decent enough hardware to run your IDE in Ubuntu on a Virtual Machine. What you cannot afford is tinkering for weeks with Linux poor multi-monitor support with no stable solution in sight.\nPlease prove me wrong, I gave up.\n", "Q: Are the Ubuntu ISO images updated From release .ubuntu.com Just got idea from this(may not be related though) question however.\nAre the ISO images from the official site updated with updates in Core Ubuntu system , like Kernel Updates , desktop Environment Updates(unity), i mean Updates of BASE system including X-org, Office suite, Package Manager , Update manager or Gnome Base Modules, those released in update Branches like precise-Updates branch. \nThe reason i am asking this is , if i download the ISO image of Ubuntu 12.04  Say after two or three months from release , i have to do an update of approximately 200~300 MB's size.\nSo why are these ISO images not updated to recent updates, i am aware that all of the components are not updated at the same time , but let's say after One month from actual release ( Both LTS and normal releases), the updated components can be added to form a Updated ISO in regular intervals, which provides new users to use latest versions and features with improved stability and less bandwidth Consumption.\nI am not mentioning  the idea of  comparison to Rolling Release , or External PPA's added updates , and neither Netinstal but the ISO of updated Packages .This can be provided as optional download.\nSince my question is within the boundary of Official updates releases so stability could not be the reason. I guess there are custom packagers out there , but having  an official option would be better. \nIt helps in distributing Newest ISO OS which impresses a lot new users , since it makes availability of newer features and a faster system ofcourse. Another reason of asking this is here. \nEdit: Since almost all new (Desktop) users download the Default ISO's having one or few issue  , which may have been corrected in following updates. But most of new laptop users i encountered gave up because of it , so should i suggest ,for laptop not listed on Certified H/W list , to try daily Builds , if needed.\n\nA: Updates are incorporated at some point for LTS Releases. They are called maintenance (or point) releases and add one more number after the version, for example last maintenance release for Lucid is 10.04.4.\nThe first maintenance release is usually done three months after the official release, and another one is made each six months until a new LTS is release. So there are four maintenance releases for each LTS.\nNormal releases don't get maintenance releases.\nMark's blog post announcing them.\n\nA: The official CD/DVD images offered for download are not regularly updated, although they are updated occasionally on LTS releases.  For example, Lucid's images were last updated in February 2012 (and are called 10.04.4 - the fourth update to Lucid's ISOs).\nThese images are \"stable\" in the sense that they represent an unchanging fixed point in time, which has its benefits as you know.  In order to get updated packages and security updates, it is necessary to update from a mirror after installing from the CD.  The download size of these will vary according to time, and to which repositories you enable.\nHowever, despite this is such a thing as daily builds of the installation CDs. Because they are daily, they can change from day to day - a minor or temporary problem can appear one week and be gone the next.  As such these are not \"stable\" in the sense that they can change daily, even though they may be \"stable\" in the sense that they are generated from a \"stable\" version of Ubuntu.\n\nA: To keep the ISO images as stable as possible the Ubuntu team updates them every 6 months for LTS releases, and never for other releases. I understand exactly what you mean, but us poor people with slow/expensive internet just have to live with it, I guess. Look for an unmetered mirror for updates, perhaps: mirror.aarnet.edu.au for Bigpond in Australia.\nThe trouble with updating them often is that often you can break parts without realising it; they put the ISO through a pretty thorough testing effort before release. Between releases they feel the effort is better spent on new development, and not QA.\n", "Q: I want to know what config options were used to compile apache?

It doesn't do kind of domain (virtual machine) creation. You don't need it if you use PXE/network boot and similar.\n\nlibvirt_domain_new($conn, $name, $arch, $memMB, $maxmemMB, $vcpus,\n    $iso_image, $disks, $networks, $flags)\n\nThis is for installation of the new virtual machine. First of all, you need to connect to libvirt daemon instance using libvirt_connect(). The return value of libvirt_connect() is the pointer/resource you need to pass as the first argument of this function. Then, you have to provide a virtual machine name, architecture (i686 or x86_64), initial and maximum memory in Megabytes (see the system specifications for operating system you want to install there first), number of VCPUs, ISO image to install this from (for PXE boot you don't require this and you can pass 'false' there), array of disk information (may be false too) and network cards. \nThe flags are optional and you don't have to pass them. Please refer to examples directory of the libvirt-php installation for real-world example - this is better than something written in here. Installation itself is a complex task so that's why it requires too many information\n\nlibvirt_domain_create($res)\n\nThis creates the domain identified by a resource. The resource is basically already existing domain found by libvirt_domain_lookup_*() API functions.\n\nlibvirt_domain_create_xml($conn, $xml)\n\nThis creates one time domain that's not persistent. This domain is just run once as based on the libvirt XML file.\nFor format of libvirt XML files please refer to libvirt documentation, not libvirt-php.\n", "Q: I can't click on some things and other problems I have some issues with my Ubuntu 12.04 . \n\n\n*\n\n*When I open Ubuntu Software Center, the program opens and than just disappears just when it is opened.\n\n*My Ubuntu 12.04 won't install any updates because of this error in the picture.\n\n*Worst of all: I can't click on anything except for programs that from Ubuntu: for example I can't browse the internet via Firefox or Chromium...

If I change the wallpaper to anything other than the default, after restarting the system, my screen remains completely black..\n\nA: It might be because the system cannot find/access the selected wallpaper after restart (due to folder/file permissions or unmounted partition, etc.?), maybe you can try copying/moving it to user-specific or system-wide folder for wallpapers (e.g. /home/you/.wallpapers, /usr/share/wallpapers, or \"backgrounds\" or something like this)?\nAlternatively, if you cannot get more or better answers, you may perhaps consider upgrading to the current Ubuntu version unless you have a good reason not to do so.\n\nA: All you need to do is\n\n*\n\n*Copy the file to your Home directory (partition of Ubuntu)\n\n\n*Give 700 permission to that image you are using with the command\nchmod 700 filename\n\nIt won't change when you restart.\n", "Q: Opening the file browser of the remote machine via terminal and moving files around?

How I can do this? Thanks.\n\nA: Try the following to get nautilus to show up.  It does not allow drag and drop onto the local machine, but you could use a network share.  That Is what I usually do.\n    nautilus --browser --no-desktop &\n\n\nA: Please clarify.\nIf you SSH to a remote host and run Nautilus, it will load a GUI file-browser on the remote host.  Unless this host is close by, you wont be able to use this to copy/move any files.\nOtherwise ..\nI use SSH all the time, both at command line (to distant hosts, over slow connection) and from Nautilus (on my own Ubuntu PC) using 'Connect to server ..' to open a new tab (or window) of the remote machine.  This then allows me drag-and-drop, to/from local machine and remote machine.\nNote: Nautilus works best in 'pull' mode, (that is) copying from the remote PC to your local PC.  In 'push' mode (copying to a remote host) it will often replace file date-stamps (due to a Nautilus and/or SSH/SFTP bug) with today's time/date.\n\nA: You don't need to ssh to the remote host - just use your local machine's Nautilus file browser to open the remote server directly.\n\n\n*\n\n*On your local machine, open Nautilus.  \n\n*in the location bar, enter  sftp://username@remotehost.example.com\n\n*enter your remote password when prompted.\n\n*You will then be able to copy files to/from the remote host using drag&drop.\n\n\nYou can bookmark the remote server as well to make it even easier to connect next time.\nMore info:\nhttp://linux.about.com/od/ubuntu_doc/a/ubudg10t9.htm\n\nA: I'd love to be proved wrong, but I'm quite certain this is not possible.

However, the support for it ended on April 10, 2012, which means that if you install it, you will not receive updates or support for Canonical.\nIf you do not want to use Ubuntu Netbook Edition (a good idea; it is outdated and most of it's features have been merged with the main release), you can install the \"Gnome\" package from the Ubuntu Software Center (or run sudo apt-get install gnome), which will install Gnome Classic, which uses less resources than the Unity shell.\nAnother option for you would be to install Lubuntu , an Ubuntu version with the lightweight window manager LXDE and lighter-weight alternatives to Ubuntu's stock software.\n\nA: Daniel, I've successfully installed Ubuntu 11.10 on my netbook (Grundig) last year and then upgraded to 12.04 this April perfectly. Previously it was used by my daughter with Windows pre-installed, and she commented that it was a superb system upgrade :-)\nUbuntu is much more friendly towards (and compatible with) netbooks than Windows. \nYour problem is probably with the USB image. I think you should perhaps try another way for USB installation, e.g. http://liveusb.info to make a good working Ubuntu Live USB image.\nI recommend that you boot your netbook from this USB and see if you I have a working Ubuntu Live system by going to desktop and trying it out first, and then rebooting to install this time before going to the Live session.\nDon't worry, your Windows installation will work as before if you install Ubuntu in a second partition. You may also consider using a third partition for your data (e.g. in NTFS format) to use from both systems.\nGood luck...\n\nA: I have an Acer Aspire One ZG5 that has 1.5gb RAM that I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 32bit. It is slow to open applications and does lag when streaming video, but has no major problems. I've been running Ubuntu on it for over a year and I am happy with it, just don't expect great speed. Something unique about this netbook keeps me using it. Even though it is the slowest piece of technology that I have. \n\nA: I've just updated my Acer aspire one to the latest version of ubuntu 12.10. I took the following route:\n\n\n*\n\n*Wiped the hard disk using dban via DVD (USB version wasn't working);\n\n*Downloaded ubuntu 12.10 as iso file on windows PC;\n\n*Used universal USB installer on PC to create installation files on a 4GB USB drive;\n\n*Changed boot order of netbook to boot from USB key drive;\n\n*Installed ubuntu via USB key;\n\n*I initially had problems with wireless which are now resolved;\n\n\nSeems so far to work but early days yat.\n", "Q: What has 'rm -r ~' done to my home directory? gedit creates hidden backup files ending with '~'. I wanted to do a recursive cleanup of my directory tree.\nThe command rm *~ will delete all local files ending with '~'\nI thought rm -r *~ . would delete all files in the whole tree, but I typo-ed rm -r ~.\nThere was a message some directory could not be deleted and I quit the command. The question is: What have I been deleting?\nI did notice that my Filezilla configuration was gone. Does this command delete all hidden directories from the home dir?\n\nA: Yes. An unquoted tilde character as a separate argument gets expanded to your homedir. So rm -r ~ got expanded to rm -r /home/yourusename. So you told rm to recursively delete all files in your homedir.\nSee http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Tilde-Expansion for more about how tilde expansion works.\n\nA: You have deleted (almost) all of your home directory!\nrm -r something recursively deletes files and directories in/under something; it will only fail on items it does not have permission to delete, either because they are owned by a different user (e.g. root), or because they are in use (e.g. a GVFS mount).\nIf you did not add -f (as in, rm -rf something), you would get something like:\nrm: remove write-protected regular file ‘something’?\nrm: descend into write-protected directory ‘something’?\n\nAt this point you can abort and you then likely realise that you executed the wrong command.\nSuggestions from the community on how to avoid such accidents\n\nNote: Community wiki, everyone please feel free to contribute.\n\n\n\n*\n\n*For a few files, use the -i option to get a confirmation on removing files or directories:\n$ rm -ri something/\nrm: remove regular file ‘something/file~’? y\nrm: descend into directory ‘something’? y\nrm: remove regular file ‘something/file’? y\nrm: remove directory ‘something’? y\n\n\n*If removing from a current directory, prefix it by a ./ to avoid mistakingly removing a different location.:\n$ cd something\n$ rm -v ./*~\nremoved ‘./file~’\n\nThe above was for demonstrating the use of ./. If there is a subdirectory, you can of course use rm -v something/*~ as well. Beware: do not think that rm ./.* removes all hidden files in the current directory. See this Serverfault question for workarounds on hidden files globbing.\n\n*Move rather than delete: Rather than deleting files recursively in the first place I got used to move the files I want to get rid of somewhere else before I delete them finally. If something went wrong its easy to restore.\nmv -b SOURCE DEST\n\n\n*Use find (possibly with grep) to preview if you want to recursively delete selected files.  You should try to make this a rare occurrence, but if you have to...\n\n\n*\n\n*find with no arguments recursively lists all files/directories under the current one. You should try to look up man find on how to make it selective (a treasure trove), but if you don't want to bother, you can just use the familiar grep to filter for the files you want to delete.\n\n*Suppose I'm an uber-l33t kernel hacker, and am bothered by the few KBs of \"example\" files in my source tree; I want to delete all files containing that in the name. So I type find | grep example, which gives me these 20 files.  That looks good, so I now go and delete those exact files, along with the rm -v verbose output previously mentioned, via xargs:\n\nfind | grep example | xargs rm -v\n\nwhich gives me this output.   Such previewing prevents problems where say, you make a typo and type sample instead of example.\n\n\n\nThe above solution should not be used if you may have filenames containing spaces, tab characters, newlines, or quotes (\" or '), as this will lead xargs to either fail, or feed rm with incomplete filenames, which in worst case could end up removing the wrong files. The safe way to do the above is to do it all with find's operators and actions.\nThe following will show all files that contain the word example\nfind . -name \"*example*\"  \n\nIf that list is the files you want to remove, use the -exec action to pass the files to rm.\nfind . -name \"*example*\" -exec rm -v {} +\n\nSee Using Find for more help with using find.\n", "Q: Installing ubuntu 12.04 on macbook pro9,2 I seem to have tried all the various suggested methods for installing ubuntu on a mbp, but can't seem to get anything that works and was wondering if anyone has run into any new problems with the latest non-retina models?\nI have a core i7 in my macbook, and model identifier is MacBookPro9,2. I have partitioned my HD using disk utility and have 700gig free space ready for the install (I haven't removed OSX Lion, it is still there in a 50gig partition).\nProblem:\nI am just getting a blank screen with a blinking cursor (unresponsive) in the top left whenever I boot from the disk. I left it for 20 minutes and nothing ever happened. This was without any boot manager, just holding \"c\" on startup.\nAttempted remedies:\n\n\n*\n\n*I have downloaded the 64 ubuntu iso from their site 3 times now and burned 4 separate discs to rule out some kind of corruption or burn error. I burned one in OSX Lion 10.7.4 and 3 on my windows 7 pc.\n\n*I tried holding \"alt\" instead and then navigating to the windows disc to boot. Same thing happens, blank blinking unresponsive cursor. I also tried going to the EFI disc which actually brings up a menu (after saying \"error prefix is not set\") asking if I want to install ubuntu, test for errors or partition. All three options lead me to an unresponsive blank screen (some without cursors).\n\n*I downloaded and installed rEFIt and if I hold \"alt\" on startup a linux penguin (Boot Linux from CD) appears in my boot options, along with the apple boot, and two others that I'm not sure of: \"Boot EFI\\boto\\bootx64.efi from\" and \"Boot Legacy OS from\". The \"Boot Linux from CD\" just takes me to the blank blinking cursor screen; again, I left if for 10+ minutes and nothing.\n\n*I heard that the detection of the graphics card might be a problem and that I need change to nomodeset, but I have tried pressing F6 in all of the boot menus listed above and no options appear.\nDoes anyone have any other suggested routes or can you see what I might have done wrong?\n\nA: I am doing pretty much the exact same thing: 64-bit 12.04 on a 9,2 MBP.\nIn my case, the boot problem was fixed by adding noapic to the Kernel boot options. You will have to do this in order to boot the CD and again once you have 12.04 installed to the HD. \nIf you get past this point, you might experience additional problems that I see: the laptop gets extraordinarily warm and freezes every few hours.\nPrior to installing 64-bit 12.04 I installed the 32-bit version, which seems to work better. I may go back to that or skip the whole project until support catches up with the bleeding edge hardware.\n\nA: Your 9,1 15\" notes will work for 9,2 13\".

I have build a Ubuntu NAS to store my windows files. I can move files from windows to the shared folder in ubuntu but when logged in ubuntu, I can't see the windows files that I have moved over to the ubuntu folder. Is there a way to see them from the ubuntu side?\n\nA: This is probably a permissions issue. To check, run the command sudo ls -la in a folder that has Windows files. You should see your missing files. (The sudo command uses the \"super user\" account, which has authority to almost everything.)\nIf so, the problem is that samba is not assigning the correct default permissions to new files. There is a setting in smb.conf that defines the default permissions for new files.\n", "Q: 3d acceleration for acer travelmate 5740z Hi I have installed ubuntu 12 and I wonder if there is 3d acceleration support for my graphic card: \nVGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 02)\n  I tested with glxgears and the result it's as it follows:\n300 frames in 5.0 seconds = 59.988 FPS\n  Shouldn't suppose to be higher with 3d acceleration support?\n\nA: That is the expected behaviour.

It may be old to have an Ubuntu installed and errors, but I can't remove, because Windows XP is damaged and unbootable. Someone can help me?\n\nA: What you should do depends on what you mean by \"Uninstall Ubuntu\". There really is no such thing as an uninstall. You could format the hard drive, which would be the closest thing. This would remove everything from the computer, including ubuntu. If you want Windows back, you can just insert a Windows installation disc and install it. Delete any existing partitions that you see, and it will automatically overwrite ubuntu.\nIf Windows XP was working fine before you installed ubuntu, it might still be bootable.

I'll mark this as resovled!\nThanks anyway, I'll try to spruse up on my Linux skills.\n\nA: The script was effective even with the syntax error, so it seems that this question really boils down to how to run a script.\nRunning as an Executable File\nTo run a script that is in the current directory without explicitly invoking the shell, you must preface its name with ./. It must also be executable.\nchmod u+x install-depot-multisystem.sh\n./install-depot-multisystem.sh\n\nThat will only work if the script starts with a hashbang line specifying what shell is supposed to run it.\nIf you ran chmod 777 on the script, and that helped, then the reason it helped was almost certainly that it gave you, as the owner of the script, execute permissions on the script. You also gave yourself and all other users read and write permissions, as well as execute permission to all other users. This is unnecessary, potentially a serious security problem. chmod u+x is just as good, and much safer.\nInvoking the Shell\nAlternatively you can run the script by explicitly invoking the shell, like you had tried initially:\nsh install-depot-multisystem.sh\n\nThe script has a .sh extension, so it should be runnable with sh. But in case the script author named it badly, and it's really a bash script, you can try running with bash (as geirha suggested):\nbash install-depot-multisystem.sh\n\nRunning in the Current Shell\nThis is included for completeness only--unless you wrote the script and know this will work properly, or the instructions that accompany the script say to run it this way, you should use one of the previous two methods instead. Many scripts will only work right if they have their own shell in which to run (which is accomplished by either of the above two methods).\nWith that said, you can attempt to run the script in the current shell, with the current shell's environment, with either of the following commands:\n. install-depot-multisystem.sh\nsource install-depot-multisystem.sh\n\nRunning as root\nIf the script is installing a systemwide program or service, it might need to be run as root. Do not run a script (or anything) as root unless you know you need to do so.\nTo run it as root, put sudo in front of the command that runs it. Any of these three commands will work (though the first still requires execute permissions):\nsudo ./install-depot-multisystem.sh\nsudo sh install-depot-multisystem.sh\n\nsudo bash install-depot-multisystem.sh\n\nA: this is not sh\nit's bash\nNot use \"sh install-depot-multisystem.sh\"\njust use: install-depot-multisystem.sh\n", "Q: Slice battery causing suspend and power issues on Lenovo X1 I have a Lenovo X1 i5vPro 2.50Gh x 4, which works fine with 12.04 LTS 64....  except the right click on the touch-pad, which I can live with..

I don't want to use PAE kernels so i am using normal kernels . but update manager giving me updates regarding PAE kernels and i dont want them .\nSo can i stop update manager about listing the updates regarding PAE Kernels .\nThank you .\n\nA: Why not remove the PAE kernels along with their headers? You don't use them anyway, and that will both solve the updates problem and free some space. To do that, use the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*This command will only show what's to be removed, without removing anything.\ndpkg -l linux-* | awk '/^ii/{ print $2}' | grep -v -e `uname -r | cut -f1,2 -d\"-\"` | grep -e [0-9] | xargs sudo apt-get --dry-run remove\n\n\n*This command will purge all unused kernels and headers.\ndpkg -l linux-* | awk '/^ii/{ print $2}' | grep -v -e `uname -r | cut -f1,2 -d\"-\"` | grep -e [0-9] | xargs sudo apt-get -y purge\n\nInfo source\nEdit: Apparently, that command doesn't remove the metapackages, so I'd add the follwoing as well:\nsudo apt-get purge linux-generic-pae linux-image-generic-pae linux-headers-generic-pae\n\n", "Q: Reverting from Ctrl - Alt - F1 I tried to install an nvidia driver and there was an error saying I must not be in an X terminal when doing so. So I did a Ctrl+Alt+F1.\nThe resulting terminal did not allow the nvidia driver to be installed and showed the same error message. How do I revert back to the Unity GUI?\n\nA: Ctrl+Alt+F7 does not work on LM13 Cinnamon.  However, Alt+F8 brings it back to GUI.\n\nA: When you are in a virtual console just press Alt+RightArrow or Alt+LeftArrow to move to next/previous virtual console respectively. Console with X is usually seventh.\n\nA: For completeness, I'll mention the chvt command. \nThe virtual terminal offers a login prompt, and if you have logged in, you can switch to other VTs:\nchvt 7\n\nwill probably get you back to the GUI, since it usually runs on VT7, as mentioned in the other answers.\nThis is useful for scripting (for example, when taking a screenshot of LightDM).\n\nA: To revert to the GUI desktop you have to press:\nCtrl+Alt+F7\n\nA: You can determine on which terminals you and any other users are logged in with the who command. For me it was tty9, so I had to press Ctrl+Alt+F9.\n\nA: Ctrl+Alt+F1 to F6 are the virtual consoles provided by the getty/agetty programs.\nCtrl+Alt+F7 is the console where your X server is running. The GUI (Gnome/KDE or any other) runs over X.\nSo to get back into your GUI window manager: type: \nCtrl+Alt+F7\nor\nAlt+F7\nor\nCtrl+Alt+F8\n\nWith 17.10 and newer, the login screen is on virtual terminal 1, and logged-in users' GUI sessions on VT2 and onwards. So, you may need to use Ctrl+Alt+F2 or Ctrl+Alt+F1 instead.\n\nA: It has been already mentioned that cycling with  Alt+ArrowLeft until you get back to your bellowed desktop also works, especially accross distro's (my Fedora 20, for instance, has GUI on F2), so it's convenient. \nThere's also a crude method: login and run sudo service lightdm restart, which will restart your session ( so yes, you will be logged out and will get back to login screen ). This answer also takes into account that your login manager might not be lightdm, but the idea is the same.\n", "Q: Deleted entire harddisk. Now my laptop won't boot anything and stuck at grub rescue! My laptop is Dell Inspiron N4030. I used to use Ubuntu 12.04 and it was on the entire hard drive. I tried to install windows 7 but my laptop couldn't install it. So, I decided to delete the entire hard drive and do a fresh install of Windows 7. But after deletion I immediately removed the gparted live usb which I was using to delete the partitions of my hard drive. And then tried booting from windows 7 cd, didn't work, tried ubuntu live cd, didn't work, tried hiren's boot cd, didn't work, tried super grub disk, didn't work. Probably I'm not doing it right. Help needed badly.\n\nA: If you are getting an error when trying to boot from the Ubuntu Live CD, it might be corrupted. You should create an Ubuntu Live USB, or another Live CD, and boot from that.\n\nA: If it is throwing that error every time you try and boot from a CD, you aren't booting from the CD. Check your BIOS settings and make sure that you have your boot order correct. CD-ROM should be before hard drive. How you get to your BIOS settings varies between manufacturers and models of computers. It should say something about what key to press when you boot your computer, although it is typically DEL, ESC, F12, F10 or F2.\n\nA: You can try installing fresh copy of the Ubuntu through network. Try configuring one system as server and then override your system to install a fresh copy. This can do the trick.\n", "Q: M-Audio Delta 1010LT on 12.04 I have 12.04 64bit installed, my soundcard is a Delta 1010LT, it seems to be partially detected, I've been following steps here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting/\nlspci -v | grep -A7 -i \"audio\" shows this:\n04:07.0 Multimedia audio controller: VIA Technologies Inc.

I'm running Ubuntu 12.04, and my laptop* won't wake from sleep/suspend/hibernate. (Is sleep the same thing as suspend?) I'm not even sure which of these things it's doing. When I am done working for the day, I lock my screen (Control-Alt-L). When I come back the next day, the screen is in power saving mode, and no amount of typing or clicking (on the usb keyboard/mouse or the builtin keyboard/trackpad) nor tapping the power button will bring it back to life.\nThe only way I can get my machine to work is to hold down the power button until it shuts off, then press the power button again to turn it back on. Obviously, anything I had open from the previous day is pretty much gone -- in particular, my VMs all get rudely shut down without any warning.\nThis is driving me INSANE. I spend the first hour of every work day trying to figure out how to get my computer to stop locking up over night.\nWhat I've tried:\n\n\n*\n\n*Editing the org.freedesktop.upower.policy to disable suspend and hibernate.\n\n*Setting power management options in \"Power\" section of \"System Settings\".\n\n*Looking at all power management options in the BIOS (none appear to be relevant to sleep/suspend/hibernate).\n\n*Reading every forum post/askubuntu post that I can find that's even tangentially related to the subject.\n\n*Add acpi=off to kernel args. (Results in USB keyboard and mouse not working, so I didn't wait to see if it fixes the suspend.)\n\n*Add apm=off to kernel args.\n\n\nMy question: how to disable the automatic sleep and/or hibernate (and/or anything similar) in Ubuntu 12.04. I don't care if it's still possible to sleep/suspend/hibernate/whatever by pushing buttons or running some command or reciting led zeppelin lyrics backwards. I just want my laptop to be ready for work in the morning.\n*The laptop is a Dell Latitude something or other. I don't want to get too specific because I've seen a lot of similar questions get closed for being too specific. I think my question is generic enough to stand -- it's a question about the latest, stable version of Ubuntu.\nLink to dmesg\nLink to /var/log/kern.log\nEDIT:\nNothing I've tried so far has prevented Ubuntu from sleeping at night, and when it does sleep, nothing I have tried can reliably get it to wake back up. I've seen a few posts that say buggy video drivers can cause problems with waking.\nLast night, on a hunch, I tried switching to console (ctrl+alt+1) before leaving work, just to see what would happen. This morning when I woke up the computer, it instantly woke up back to the console. I switched over to Gnome (ctrl+alt+7) and although the screen looked frozen, I typed my password, pressed enter, and made some coffee. When I got back a few minutes later, my desktop was ready, just like I left it last night.\nI'm going to keep trying this to see if this is a reliable solution.\nEDIT 2:\nNo dice. Switching to the console after logging out does nothing for me... still have to reboot my computer each morning. It's driving me nuts... I can't believe how erratic suspend is on Ubuntu. Or the fact that it can't simply be disabled. \n\nA: Why not check out Caffeine application indicator. It does precisely what you want, and is very easy to use.\n\nA: @Kaled Kelevra, I've created the file 00CPU and followed all the steps, unfortunately my machine still went to sleep after 10 minutes.\nOn the ArchLinux forums, I found a solution that worked for me. See answer #21.\nThis is how I fixed mine in /etc/X11/xorg.conf:\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n\n    Identifier     \"Layout0\"\n    Screen      0  \"Screen0\"\n    InputDevice    \"Keyboard0\" \"CoreKeyboard\"\n    InputDevice    \"Evdev Mouse\" \"CorePointer\"\n\n  Option \"BlankTime\" \"0\"\n  Option \"StandbyTime\" \"0\"\n  Option \"SuspendTime\" \"0\"\n  Option \"OffTime\" \"0\"\n\nI just added the 4 options you see there. Test it out and post back. Good luck.\n\nA: Here are the two common Gnome 3 ways which usually disable suspend; otherwise you can try booting with the acpi=off parameter:\n\n\n*\n\n*Power Settings:\n\n\n\n*gnome-tweak-tool (install if necessary):\n\n\nA: In unity dash type screen saver, and click on it.  When the window open click on the advanced tab, and uncheck Power Management Enabled.\n\n\nA: I don't know if you had solved that problem you have with suspend/hibernate, but if not, I've a script maybe solve it (I had the same problem and it worked for me). :)\nCreate a script in the /etc/pm/sleep.d/ directory (\"sudo gedit /etc/pm/sleep.d/ 00CPU\", for example) with the following content:\n#!/bin/sh\n# Workaround for concurrency bug in xserver-xorg-video-intel 2:2.4.1-1ubuntu10.\n# Save this as /etc/pm/sleep.d/00CPU\n\n. \"${PM_FUNCTIONS}\"\n\ncase \"$1\" in\nhibernate|suspend)\nfor i in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/online ; do\necho 0 >$i\ndone\n;;\nthaw|resume) \nsleep 10 # run with one core for 10 secs\nfor i in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/online ; do\necho 1 >$i\ndone\n;;\n*)\n;;\nesac\n\nThen just give the script execute permission (sudo chmod 755 00CPU) and... that's all! Enjoy your Ubuntu.\nP.S.: sorry for my english.\nP.S.2.: you can change the \"sleep 10\" value, with \"sleep 5\" for example, so your second processor core will run a bit earlier.\nNote: It seems to be a concurrency problem with some kernels versions and determinate multi-core processors.\n\nA: You can use gsettings for enabling and disabling monitor from going to sleep:\n\n\n*\n\n*Disable turning off screen \n\n\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay 0\n\n\n*Enable turning off screen with 5 min delay\n\n\ngsettings set org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay 300\n\nsource : https://askubuntu.com/a/788456/88543\n\nA: From System Settings or by searching in Dash, go to Power settings. You'll find what you need there ;)\n\nAnd to prevent from locking, go to Brightness and Lock:\n\n\nA: With 12.04 I've noticed that my computer seems to be very hard to activate once the screensaver/lock has been invoked, particularly when it is locked for more than a few minutes. The system isn't really being suspended or hibernated--it just seems that way.\nI find that I can wait several minutes and eventually the system will prompt me for my userid and password and I'm back in business. Before I figured out that it would come back I'd power it off like you do.\nI don't know why it takes so long, it's probably a bug. Does it help to simply wait 3 to 10 minutes?

When the computer in use has been shipped with UFEI firmware and boot manger, as is increasingly the case, then using EasyBCD is (by their own admission) not really appropriate.\nOne of the alternatives offered (by EasyBCD) is to use a virtual machine.

It is a free tool (you'll have to click the \"Register\" Link at the bottom, although you don't need to register) that allows you to modify the Windows BootLoader in a pain-free way.\nNext, launch EasyBCD.

The question is: How can I permanently keep skype-wrapper in the messaging menu (so that I can turn it on from there), like I can with empathy and friends?\n\nA: The /usr/share/indicators/messages/applications directory holds a list of text files each containing the path to the desktop launcher of the application the text file is named after.\nTo add Skype-Wrapper, simply write following command (all one line):\necho \"/usr/share/applications/skype-wrapper.desktop\" | sudo tee /usr/share/indicators/messages/applications/skype-wrapper\nThis is, of course, assuming that the Skype-Wrapper launcher is at /usr/share/applications/skype-wrapper.desktop.\nLogout, log back in and you are set.\n", "Q: Camera problems after upgrade After today's upgrade of 12.04 to the latest Linux kernel and Chrome to version 20 my camera (Creative Live! Cam Sicialize HD) behaves weirdly when I'm on Gmail page in Chrome: it blinks and the browser itself hangs from time to time for a few seconds. I don't know which affects which (i.e. Linux update troubles Chrome or vise versa) and so far could't find a solution.\nIt's obvious though that the above behavior is caused by Chrome's Talk plugin - when I close the Gmail tab the browser returns back to normal. \nAny ideas what it is and how to fix this issue? \n\nA: It seems the google talk plugin is flash based. You may be having problems with the new version of flash. \nThis isn't guaranteed to fix your problem, but try disabling the latest version of flash (will default to 11.2 instead). \n\n\n*\n\n*Type about:plugins in the url bar\n\n*Click details\n\n*Disable Flash\n\n", "Q: Can I provision a MAAS node with an arbitrary install image? I'd like to provision machines using arbitrary install images (i.e. Ubuntu +1 daily ISOs.)  I know this is possible in cobbler, and I'm wondering if it can be done using the MAAS API or if I should just use cobbler directly.\n\nA: While you could technically be able to do so, MAAS only know about Ubuntu Precise. In order to be able to do it, you would have to do the following:\n\n\n*\n\n*Import a Quantal ISO.\n\n*Point the Cobbler profile to the newly imported Quantal Distro.\n\n*Deploy.\n\n\nFor MAAS eyes, you would still be deploying precise, but in reality you would be deploying Quantal. However, if you were to use juju you might find errors while using the charms.\nThis could help you to do some minor testing, but it is not yet recommended to do so. Quantal support will be added soon.\n", "Q: setting XDG_DATA_DIRS and XDG_DATA_HOME I made some mistake by setting environment variabel\nNow i can not launch any application from the console and recieve this error: \nGLib-GIO-ERROR **: No GSettings schemas are installed on the system\n\nI have reinstall gsettings-desktop-schemas but of course that helps not all.\nI made setting of variable because i wanted to make view3dscene launchable from the dash:\nXDG_DATA_HOME=/usr/local/share/\nexport XDG_DATA_HOME\n\nand\nXDG_DATA_DIRS=/usr/local/share/\nexport XDG_DATA_DIRS\n\nI had a console warning during the installation of view3dscene as follow:\nNote that '/home/XXX/.local/share' is not in the search path\nset by the XDG_DATA_HOME and XDG_DATA_DIRS\nenvironment variables, so applications may not\nbe able to find it until you set them.

You don't need to set those environment variables. The /usr/local/share path is included in XDG_DATA_DIRS by default.\nThe warning message probably came as a result of you installing it as the root user, rather than the normal user. You should likely just ignore it, and should be able to run view3dscene just fine as your normal user if you've installed it properly.\n", "Q: Cannot RDP to Windows 7 with Remmina on 12.04 Since I upgraded to 12.04, I am unable to RDP to a Windows 7 server. All I can see is a pop-up that says \"Uable to connect to RDP server \". I am able to RDP using Vinagre, so that rules out any issues with my router or the Windows server.\nAs far as I can tell, there are no logs from Remmina and the Debug window shows a blank.\nAny one got any ideas?\nThanks.\n\nA: I have no idea why it worked, but I started changing settings one at a time. When I edited the connection properties, I looked on the \"advanced\" tab and changed the security from \"negotiate\" to \"TLS\", and voila, everything works.\nStrangely, \"negotiate\" still works on the laptop, but at least I'm back in business with my bigger monitor :)\n\nA: Click Advanced tab in your Remote Desktop Preferences and choose RDP in Security drop down menu and save.\nSo far it works for me.\n\nA: I haven't had any files in ~/.freerdp/certs/ so I went ahead and cleared the file ~/.freerdp/known_hosts with this command:\necho \"\" > ~/.freerdp/known_hosts\n\nBe careful! This will erase the entire file. I only had one entry, so it was okay.\nAfterwards connecting to the server Remmina asked me to accept the servers certificate, which I did, and everything was finally back to normal. I suspect that an update of Remmina or the RDP protocoll might be the issue.\n\nA: I resolved this issue by activating the console mode for windows 2003.\nAdvanced ->\nProtocol RDP\nsecurity = RDP\ntick: Attach to console\n\nA: I too had the problem that I could connect to a Windows 7 machine and suddenly (after weeks) I got this error:\nUnable to connect to RDP server \nIn my case I deleted the entry from ~/.freerdp/known_hosts and it then worked fine.\n\nA: I had a similar problem, getting the \"Unable to connect to RDP server\" message using Remmina and Ubuntu 12.04 to a Windows 7 machine.\nIt worked fine for weeks and then suddenly stopped.\nWhat fixed it was going to ~/.freerdp/certs and deleting the problem server from that file.\nThe next time it connected, it asked for a new cert and worked fine.\n\nA: I had this problem. Like you I had no output when running remmina on the command line and the debug window was blank. I solved this by removing the line in the file ~/.freerdp corresponding to the problem server.\n", "Q: Is it possible to install Ubuntu from an Ubuntu host machine onto a partition without needing to boot to install media? I.e. can you run the install program from an already running linux machine to install ubuntu on a separate disk/partition? I suppose it would effectively be a wubi for linux.\nMy use case is building a disk image from scratch. I could do it via virtual machine I think, but would be much easier if there was another option.\n\nA: Not sure what you want to do.\nI guess you want to install in a Windows machine with Wubi that don't have internet access ? \nAnd that you don't want to burn a CD ?\nThen just copy the iso and mount it in Windows , you will launch th Wubi on the iso  and it will install without internet.\n", "Q: wired resolves dns but wireless dont My wireless won't resolve dns but my wired connection does.\nI've tried:\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart \n\nand:\n$ sudo dhclient -r\n$ sudo dhclient \n\nas I saw at that question.

The installation paused halfway with a message that the root was full. I checked the disk usage, and noticed that one of the newly installed files:\n/lib/modules/3.2.0-26-generic/modules.ccwmap took up 63GB(!). Compared to the previous version, /lib/modules/3.2.0-24-generic/modules.ccwmap, that took up only 4KB.

According to this link, GRUB 2.00 has just been released. How can one upgrade to this?\n\nA: \nDanger!\nGRUB is your bootloader  -- the first piece of software to start after you switch on your computer, and responsible for loading the operating system.\n  Grub 2.00 has not been tested by Ubuntu and any problems may render your system unbootable--including Windows if dual-boot--and will require a LiveCD/LiveUSB and time to fix.\nUnless you simply want to experiment, it is highly recommended to wait for Grub 2.00 to officially make its way into Ubuntu (or at least until 2.00 shows up in Debian Sid or the Quantal alphas!)\nThat said, Linux/FOSS is about freedom, and if you get the gun, I'll teach you how to shoot! :)\n\n\nIf you still want to install Grub 2.00 after the warnings above:\nYou'll have to build it from source.

I have several books on Linux device-drivers, but I need a little help to get started.\n\nA: Since you are asking here at askubuntu, I'll just assume that you intend to develop for the Linux kernel. You are not mentioning anything in specific, so here are some tips:\nConcept:\n\nA device driver is a program that controls a particular type of device that is attached to your computer.\n\nThis means that a device driver acts as translator between a hardware device and the applications or operating systems that use it.\n\nRequisits:\n\nIn order to develop Linux device drivers, it is necessary to have an understanding of the following:\n  \n  \n*\n  \n*C programming. Some in-depth knowledge of C programming is needed, like pointer usage, bit manipulating functions, etc.\n  \n*Microprocessor programming. It is necessary to know how microcomputers work internally: memory addressing, interrupts, etc. All of these concepts should be familiar to an assembler programmer.\n  \n*Last but not the least, the Linux Kernel is what stands between all that you'll be doing.\n\n\nResources, Links and Help:\n\n\n*\n\n*Writing device drivers in Linux: A brief tutorial (knowing what you're in for)\n\n*Linux Kernel 2.6 Programming guide (learning about the backstage)\n\n*Linux Device Drivers, Third Edition (PDF)\n\n*UbuntuDevelopment (here you might get some help from other Ubuntu developers)\n\nPractical example:\nA step by step how-to, with a goal of making a simple USB lamp device, and its driver for Linux:\nWriting a Simple USB Driver | Linux Journal\n\nGive your Linux box a multicolored light you can see from across the room, and learn how to write a simple driver for the next piece of hardware you want to hook up. \n\n", "Q: How to determine whether a process is running or not and make use it to make a conditional shell script? How can I determine if a process is running or not and then have a bash script execute some stuff based on that condition?\nFor example:\n\n\n*\n\n*if process abc is running, do this\n\n*if it is not running, do that.\n\nA: I usually have a pidof -x $(basename $0) on my scripts to check if it's already running.\n\nA: Any solution that uses something like ps aux | grep abc or pgrep abc are flawed.\nWhy?\nBecause you are not checking if a specific process is running, you are checking if there are any processes running that happens to match abc. Any user can easily create and run an executable named abc (or that contains abc somewhere in its name or arguments), causing a false positive for your test. There are various options you can apply to ps, grep and pgrep to narrow the search, but you still won't get a reliable test.\nSo how do I reliably test for a certain running process?\nThat depends on what you need the test for.\nI want to ensure that service abc is running, and if not, start it\nThis is what systemd is for. It can start the service automatically and keep track of it, and it can react when it dies.\nSee How can I check to see if my game server is still running... for other solutions.\nabc is my script. I need to make sure only one instance of my script is running.\nIn this case, use a lockfile or a lockdir. E.g.\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nif ! mkdir /tmp/abc.lock; then\n    printf \"Failed to acquire lock.\\n\" >&2\n    exit 1\nfi\ntrap 'rm -rf /tmp/abc.lock' EXIT  # remove the lockdir on exit\n\n# rest of script ...\n\nSee Bash FAQ 45 for other ways of locking.\n\nA: Riffing on @rommel-cid's idea, you can use pidof with the || (||) to run a command if the process does not exist and && to run something if the process does exist, thus creating a quick if/then/else conditional. For example here's one with a running process (my chrome browser, whose process name is \"chrome\") and one testing for a process that does not exist.  I suppressed the standard output using 1>/dev/null so that it doesn't print:\n$ (pidof chrome 1>/dev/null && echo \"its running? ok, so am i then\" ) || echo \"it's not running? ok i'll run instea\\\nd\"\nits running? ok, so am i then\n$ (pidof nosuchprocess 1>/dev/null && echo \"its running? ok, so am i then\" ) || echo \"it's not running? ok i'll run\\\n instead\"\nit's not running? ok i'll run instead\n$\n\n\nA: A bash script to do something like that would look something like this:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Check if gedit is running\n# -x flag only match processes whose name (or command line if -f is\n# specified) exactly match the pattern. \n\nif pgrep -x \"gedit\" > /dev/null\nthen\n    echo \"Running\"\nelse\n    echo \"Stopped\"\nfi\n\nThis script is just checking to see if the program \"gedit\" is running.\nOr you can only check if the program is not running like this:\nif ! pgrep -x \"gedit\" > /dev/null\nthen\n    echo \"Stopped\"\nfi\n\n\nA: This is what I use:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n#check if abc is running\nif pgrep abc >/dev/null 2>&1\n  then\n     # abc is running\n  else\n     # abc is not running\nfi\n\nIn plain English: if 'pgrep' returns 0, the process is running, otherwise it is not.\n\nRelated reading:\nBash Scripting :: String Comparisons\nUbuntu Manuals pgrep\n\nA: ## bash\n\n## function to check if a process is alive and running:\n\n_isRunning() {\n    ps -o comm= -C \"$1\" 2>/dev/null | grep -x \"$1\" >/dev/null 2>&1\n}\n\n## example 1: checking if \"gedit\" is running\n\nif _isRunning gedit; then\n    echo \"gedit is running\"\nelse\n    echo \"gedit is not running\"\nfi\n\n## example 2: start lxpanel if it is not there\n\nif ! _isRunning lxpanel; then\n    lxpanel &\nfi\n\n## or\n\n_isRunning lxpanel || (lxpanel &)\n\n\nNote: pgrep -x lxpanel or pidof lxpanel still reports that lxpanel is running even when it is defunct (zombie); so to get alive-and-running process, we need to use ps and grep\n\nA: None of the \"simple\" solutions worked for me because the binary I need to check is not installed system-wide, so I have to check with path, which in turn requires using ps -ef | grep approach:\napp=\"$_sdir/Logic 1.2.18 (64-bit)/Logic\"\n\napp_pid=`ps -ef | grep \"$app\" | awk '{print $2}'`\n\nif `ps -p $app_pid > /dev/null`; then\n    echo \"An instance of logic analyzer is appear to be running.\"\n    echo \"Not starting another instance.\"\n    exit 5\nelse\n    nohup \"$app\" &> /dev/null &\nfi\n\n\nA: By pid:\npgrep [pid] >/dev/null\n\nBy name:\npgrep -u [user] -x [name] >/dev/null\n\n\"-x\" means \"exact match\".\n\nA: First thing that came to my mind for your problem: \nps aux | grep -i abc will show the details of the process if its running. You may match the number of lines or time for which its running and compare with zero or any other manipulation. When you run the above command it will show you atleast one line of output i.e. detail about the process created by thi grep command.. So take care of that. \nThat should do as a simple hack.

This was not the original question, the original question was to check if a process is running or not.\nHere's what worked for me:\nSay my process had the string \"Jane\" in it's process name.

It's a great machine but some issues need to be solved after installing Ubuntu 12.04.\nI've made a thread in Ubuntu Forums about how to solve temperature, battery and touchpad issues.\nHere it is:\nUbuntu 12.04 LTS on Dell XPS 14z - temperature, touchpad and other issues\nHere are solutions and workarounds that I found for temperature and battery consumption on the Dell XPS 14z (L412z) notebook, while running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin).\nTEMPERATURE ISSUE AND BATTERY LIFE ON DELL XPS 14Z WITH UBUNTU 12.04 LTS\nAfter these tweaks, the CPU temperature will run in about 40 up to 48ºC with regular use (this is OK), and up to 80ºC when gaming (my alarm is set to 85ºC). The HDD temperature will decrease to 36 up to 41ºC.\n1. Install and configure lm-sensors and cpufrequtils:\n    sudo apt-get install lm-sensors cpufrequtils indicator-cpufreq\n    sudo sensors-detect\n\n(confirm all options with \"y\")\n2. Install Psensor to keep track of your CPU and HD temperature:\n    sudo apt-get install psensor\n\n(choose to activate \"hddtemp\" on boot when asked)\n\n\n*\n\n*After install it will execute automaticaly on system startup. \n\n*You can block it on the launcher to see it permanently (the launcher icon has a neat temperature indicator).\n\n\n3. Install Jupiter to manage battery consumption:\n    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/jupiter && sudo apt-get update\n    sudo apt-get install jupiter\n\n4. Install Bumblebee to manage battery consumption and the use of the nVIDIA GPU when needed (use \"optirun\" before the application name to open with nVIDIA GPU):\n    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable && sudo apt-get update\n    sudo apt-get install bumblebee\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Test and compare:\nglxspheres\noptirun glxspheres\n\n5.

There's a list of certified hardware available here:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/certification/desktop/make/Dell/?page=1&category=Desktop&category=Laptop&category=Netbook\n\nA: try a live media ( for example live CD or Live USB ), boot from that media and will see if your laptop is compitabled with your machine \n\nA: I would recommend trying Ubuntu 12.04 (64bit) from LiveCD, before either installing alongside (as dual-boot) or fully replacing the Windows 7 Home Premium that Dell provides.\nNote: With an Intel Core i7-2640M (2.8GHz), 8GB RAM, and 750GB hard drive, this should reasonably be 2-3 times faster at most operations under Ubuntu 12.04 (64bit) than as supplied with Windows 7.\nUPDATE\nYou can't easily use Windows 7 configuration to release the 'unused' disk space, although that is the recommended (and safe) method.  The vendor may have also tied up 200-400MB for a recovery partition (for Windows 7).  Windows 7 also does not like to shrink past about 243GB, and complains that something important (like swap file) will be affected.\nSuggest approach:\nTry installing on Windows 7, as WUBI install, to see if this will run on this Laptop.  If this fails, or there is not enough room, move on ..\nIf you have re-install disks for Windows 7, or the shop/vendor will supply them, the replace the current Windows 7 install with 64bit Ubuntu 12.04.  I would not comment trying dual-boot on only 256GB.  You will want to keep 100GB for 'media files', pictures, etc. and it will get full fast even with Windows 7 only hogging 75GB (the plausible minimum).\n", "Q: Why is swap being used even though I have plenty of free RAM? I thought the whole essence of swap was to act as a temporary storage safety net when RAM was full but my swap partition is constantly being used even though I sometimes have as much as 3GB free RAM. Is this normal?\n\nA: Generally swap remains unused on now-a-days systems. In my experience, the processes which are running for a long time without intensive operations are shifted to swap by the linux. \nIt makes a few affected programs run slow. \nIf you have lots of ram free, you may switch the swap off by running the command: \nswapoff -av (you'll need sudo rights for it.)\n\nIf you don't like the swap off, you may switch it on, using symmetrical command: \nswapon -av (again sudo required).\n\nA: Once swap has been used for a program it tends to remain mapped for the life of the program.  Many programs have code (and data) which is rarely used..  Once the memory is swapped out, it is unlikely to be swapped in. \nOne way to force these pages into memory is to turn off the swap device.  If you have two, you can turn one off, the turn it back on, then turn off the second one.  If swap is really needed, it will move between devices.  You could just turn off the swap device (or file), but if you really need swap space drastic things can happen.\nBesides the normal things in memory, tempfs uses swap space, and will swap out like the rest of memory.  If you run something that requires a lot of temp disk, it may force pages to be swapped out.  Once created temp files may no longer be used after a couple of minutes and are good candidates to be moved to the swap device. \nIn a pinch you can use a file as a swap device.  This is useful if you need extra swap space temporarily. \n\nA: Setting the swappiness value doesn't work in every situation. If it works for you, great. If not, I've written a script to periodically clear out swap by turning it off and back on again.\nToggling swap is a bit risky if you're not careful. If you don't have enough free RAM to hold everything in RAM plus everything in swap, trying to disable swap will cause your system to become unresponsive. My script first checks whether there's enough free RAM (which takes a bit of doing, as the actual amount of free RAM is different from what free reports as free), then only toggles swap if so. But, if you're a bit short on RAM, don't start another major process while the script is running. Here it is:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Make sure that all text is parsed in the same language\nexport LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8\nexport LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8\nexport LANG=en_US.utf8\nexport LANGUAGE=en_US:en\nexport LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8\n\n# Calculate how much memory and swap is free\nfree_data=\"$(free)\"\nmem_data=\"$(echo \"$free_data\" | grep 'Mem:')\"\nfree_mem=\"$(echo \"$mem_data\" | awk '{print $4}')\"\nbuffers=\"$(echo \"$mem_data\" | awk '{print $6}')\"\ncache=\"$(echo \"$mem_data\" | awk '{print $7}')\"\ntotal_free=$((free_mem + buffers + cache))\nused_swap=\"$(echo \"$free_data\" | grep 'Swap:' | awk '{print $3}')\"\n\necho -e \"Free memory:\\t$total_free kB ($((total_free / 1024)) MB)\\nUsed swap:\\t$used_swap kB ($((used_swap / 1024)) MB)\"\n\n# Do the work\nif [[ $used_swap -eq 0 ]]; then\n    echo \"Congratulations! No swap is in use.\"\nelif [[ $used_swap -lt $total_free ]]; then\n    echo \"Freeing swap...\"\n    swapoff -a\n    swapon -a\nelse\n    echo \"Not enough free memory. Exiting.\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nYou must run this script as root (e.g., with sudo). This script won't leave your system unresponsive; if you've got insufficient RAM, it will refuse to toggle swap. I've used this script without problems for close to five years now.\n\nA: You could try changing your \"swappiness\" value:\nFrom the Ubuntu's Swap FAQ:\n\nWhat is swappiness and how do I change it?\nThe swappiness parameter controls the tendency of the kernel to move processes out of physical memory and onto the swap disk. Because disks are much slower than RAM, this can lead to slower response times for system and applications if processes are too aggressively moved out of memory.\n\n*\n\n*swappiness can have a value of between 0 and 100\n\n\n*swappiness=0 tells the kernel to avoid swapping processes out of physical memory for as long as possible. For Kernel version 3.5 and newer it disables swappiness.\n\n\n*swappiness=100 tells the kernel to aggressively swap processes out of physical memory and move them to swap cache\nThe default setting in Ubuntu is swappiness=60. Reducing the default value of swappiness will probably improve overall performance for a typical Ubuntu desktop installation. A value of swappiness=10 is recommended, but feel free to experiment. Note: Ubuntu server installations have different performance requirements to desktop systems, and the default value of 60 is likely more suitable.\nTo check the swappiness value\ncat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness\n\nTo change the swappiness value A temporary change (lost on reboot) with a swappiness value of 10 can be made with\nsudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10\n\nTo make a change permanent, edit the configuration file with your favorite editor:\ngksudo gedit /etc/sysctl.conf\n\nSearch for vm.swappiness and change its value as desired. If vm.swappiness does not exist, add it to the end of the file like so:\nvm.swappiness=10\n\nSave the file and reboot.\n\nRun sudo sysctl --load=/etc/sysctl.conf after editing the file to apply the changes\nAlso you can check out: https://askubuntu.com/a/103916/54187\n\nA: There are a few different aspects to your question.\nFirstly, what your definition of \"free\" is.  It is actually not as simple as it sounds in Linux (or any modern operating system).\nHow Linux uses RAM (very simplified)\nEach application can use some of your memory.  Linux uses all otherwise unoccupied memory (except for the last few Mb) as \"cache\".  This includes the page cache, inode caches, etc.  This is a good thing - it helps speed things up heaps.  Both writing to disk and reading from disk can be sped up immensely by cache.\nIdeally, you have enough memory for all your applications, and you still have several hundred Mb left for cache.  In this situation, as long as your applications don't increase their memory use and the system isn't struggling to get enough space for cache, there is no need for any swap.\nOnce applications claim more RAM, it simply goes into some of the space that was used by cache, shrinking the cache.  De-allocating cache is cheap and easy enough that it is simply done in real time - everything that sits in the cache is either just a second copy of something that's already on disk, so can just be deallocated instantly, or it's something that we would have had to flush to disk within the next few seconds anyway.\nThis is not a situation that is specific to Linux - all modern operating systems work this way.  The different operating systems might just report free RAM differently: some include the cache as part of what they consider \"free\" and some may not.\nWhen you talk about free RAM, it's a lot more meaningful to include cache, because it practically is free - it's available should any application request it.  On Linux, the free command reports it both ways - the first line includes cache in the used RAM column, and the second line includes cache (and buffers) in the free column.\nHow Linux uses swap (even more simplified)\nOnce you have used up enough memory that there is not enough left for a smooth-running cache, Linux may decide to re-allocate some unused application memory from RAM to swap.\nIt doesn't do this according to a definite cut-off.  It's not like you reach a certain percentage of allocation then Linux starts swapping.  It has a rather \"fuzzy\" algorithm.  It takes a lot of things into account, which can best be described by \"how much pressure is there for memory allocation\".  If there is a lot of \"pressure\" to allocate new memory, then it will increase the chances some will be swapped to make more room.  If there is less \"pressure\" then it will decrease these chances.\nYour system has a \"swappiness\" setting which helps you tweak how this \"pressure\" is calculated.  It's normally not recommended to alter this at all, and I would not recommend you alter it.  Swapping is overall a very good thing - although there are a few edge cases where it harms performance, if you look at overall system performance it's a net benefit for a wide range of tasks.  If you reduce the swappiness, you let the amount of cache memory shrink a little bit more than it would otherwise, even when it may really be useful.  Whether this is a good enough trade-off for whatever problem you're having with swapping is up to you.  You should just know what you're doing, that's all.\nThere is a well-known situation in which swap really harms perceived performance on a desktop system, and that's in how quickly applications can respond to user input again after being left idle for a long time and having background processes heavy in IO (such as an overnight backup) run.  This is a very visible sluggishness, but not enough to justify turning off swap all together and very hard to prevent in any operating system.  Turn off swap and this initial sluggishness after the backup/virus scan may not happen, but the system may run a little bit slower all day long.  This is not a situation that's limited to Linux, either.\nWhen choosing what is to be swapped to disk, the system tries to pick memory that is not actually being used - read to or written from.  It has a pretty simple algorithm for calculating this that chooses well most of the time.\nIf you have a system where you have a huge amount of RAM (at time of writing, 8GB is a huge amount for a typical Linux distro), then you will very rarely ever hit a situation where swap is needed at all.  You may even try turning swap off.  I never recommend doing that, but only because you never know when more RAM may save you from some application crashing.  But if you know you're not going to need it, you can do it.\nBut how can swap speed up my system?  Doesn't swapping slow things down?\nThe act of transferring data from RAM to swap is a slow operation, but it's only taken when the kernel is pretty sure the overall benefit will outweigh this.  For example, if your application memory has risen to the point that you have almost no cache left and your I/O is very inefficient because of this, you can actually get a lot more speed out of your system by freeing up some memory, even after the initial expense of swapping data in order to free it up.\nIt's also a last resort should your applications actually request more memory than you actually have.  In this case, swapping is necessary to prevent an out-of-memory situation which will often result in an application crashing or having to be forcibly killed.\nSwapping is only associated with times where your system is performing poorly because it happens at times when you are running out of usable RAM, which would slow your system down (or make it unstable) even if you didn't have swap.  So to simplify things, swapping happens because your system is becoming bogged down, rather than the other way around.\nOnce data is in swap, when does it come out again?\nTransferring data out of swap is (for traditional hard disks, at least) just as time-consuming as putting it in there.  So understandably, your kernel will be just as reluctant to remove data from swap, especially if it's not actually being used (ie read from or written to).  If you have data in swap and it's not being used, then it's actually a good thing that it remains in swap, since it leaves more memory for other things that are being used, potentially speeding up your system.\n\nA: I edited the script of Scott Severance to match the newer versions of free which already include a total available memory field.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfree_mem=\"$(free | grep 'Mem:' | awk '{print $7}')\"\nused_swap=\"$(free | grep 'Swap:' | awk '{print $3}')\"\n\necho -e \"Free memory:\\t$free_mem kB ($((free_mem / 1024)) MiB)\\nUsed swap:\\t$used_swap kB ($((used_swap / 1024)) MiB)\"\nif [[ $used_swap -eq 0 ]]; then\n    echo \"Congratulations!

There's something for which I've been searching an answer for a while now, but to no avail, and it's strange to me, as it seems like a thing that people would talk about: one of those nice little nonsense that enhance the computing experience a little bit.\nAnyway. I have a fair music collection. I save all the songs as ogg files. All is fine, and I can listen to the files, but there's something weird with the files in Nautilus: some have icons displaying their album art, while others don't, and I just can't understand WHY.\nI read on this site today that it's a matter of embedding the album art to the file, but that's not true, as I embedded the album art to the files I wanted several times, to no avail. Furthermore, removing an embedded album art from a file didn't have any effect on those that ARE displaying the icons.\nSo my question is: How does it work? Where does Nautilus (or Ubuntu, I don't know) get the picture from? How do I edit it?\n\nA: I believe it does in fact use the tags embedded in the file, which are usually called id3 tags, at least for MP3.  I think ogg files read id3 tags, but may not read id3v2 tags (version 2).  Some software writes one or the other, or sometimes both.\nI've noticed that it takes a while for Nautilus to display the album art once the folder is first opened, but then it remembers them.  I'm pretty sure it stores the images in ~/.thumbhnails/normal, but this directory can be very big, and opening it is a chore.\nI've heard of a program called \"cover thumbnailer\" that makes nautilus work better; I haven't really tried it out myself, though.\n\nA: You need to download the cover art for the album, place it in the album folder and give it one of these names:\n\n\n*\n\n*folder.jpg\n\n*cover.jpg\n\n*Folder.jpeg\nI use pictures that are 500x500, the default for album art used by most programs. This will show the album art in RhythmBox. To embed the album art in the file so it shows up in Nautilus, use easytag  to embed the album art into the .ogg file's meta tag. It's a laborious project, but in my book, doing it right the first time will save you from having to redo it again later.\n\nA: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think your are affected by this bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/totem/+bug/914313\n\nA: I think it is related to the size of the mp3 files.   \nNautilus didn't display the album art for any file larger than 10Mb on my system.  \nIf you go to nautilus->edit->preferences->preview and change the selection for \"Other Previewable Files\" \"Only for files smaller than:\" and change the value to 100 MB that will probably work!\n", "Q: How do I install the full Compiz fusion plugin set?

I'm looking to install version 4.\n\nA: To the best of my knowledge, Eclipse 4 is not currently (as of 12.04) available through the Ubuntu repositories and as a result you can't install it through the software center. However, as Eclipse runs contained within it's own directory, you should be able to just download Eclipse 4, extract it to a directory somewhere and run the IDE.\nIf you want a menu launcher for it, I would suggest searching for and installing \"alacarte\" (I believe it's called \"Main Menu\" in your apps list) in the software center.

Perhaps I missed something when Canonical removed the \"Create launcher\" option from the right click menu, because I've really been missing that little guy. For me, it was the preferred way to install software that comes not in a .deb, but in a tar.gz, for example.\n(Note: in that tar.gz I have a folder with the compiled files, I'm NOT compiling from source)\nI just downloaded the new Eclipse IDE and extracted the tar.gz to my /usr folder. Now, I'd like to add it to my desktop and dash so it can be started easily. Intuitively I would right click the desktop and create a launcher. After this I'd copy the .desktop to /usr/share/applications. However, creating a launcher is not possible.\nMy question: How would you install an already compiled tar.gz that you have downloaded from the internet?\nBelow are a few things I've seen, but these are all more time-consuming than the right click option. If you have any better ideas, please let me know. Thanks!\n\nManual copy & create a .desktop file: manually\nSimply extract the archive to /usr.\nCreate a new text file, adding something along the lines of the code block below:\n[Desktop Entry]\nVersion=1.0\nType=Application\nTerminal=false\nExec=\"/usr/local/eclipse42/eclipse\"\nName=\"Eclipse 4.2\"\nIcon=/home/tomas/icons/eclipse.svg\n\nRename this file to eclipse42.desktop and make it executable.

I had a failing hard-drive so I cloned it with dd to larger 500 GB HD. It seemed to have worked well, but I have all this unallocated free space at the end of the disk (230 GB).\nI tried to used gparted from a liveUSB to allocate all this space to my root + home partitions (other than that I only have a small extended partition with the swap). It won't let me do this. I can only create another partition, or allocate the free space to the extended partition. I can however reduce the size of the root + home partition since I wasn't using all the space.\nIs there a way to put this free space to my root + home partition after all?\nOr do I have to go with another partition. If so I'd like to separate my home from the root, reduce the root partition and create a ext4 logical home partition. What would be the best and safest way to do this?\n\nA: You can do it, but maybe not in one step.  You need free space adjacent to the space you want to expand.  If another partition is in the way, such as the swap drive, you would need to first move it to the end (easy to do in gparted, just create a new swap partition, and delete the old one.  Then, you should be able to increase the partition.\nIdeally, you should have a single big extended partition, and everything else should be logical drives inside this extended partition (unless you have Windows on the drive, too; it likes to be a primary partition, I think).  But if you have a primary partition, it can still be expanded if there is adjacent space.\n", "Q: Is it possible to preview arbitrary formats in Nautilus? I recently found out that Nautilus (Ubuntu 12.04 at least) can show thumbnails of files of non-image formats, for example (data grapher) grace files (.agr) shows a small version of the graph contained in its data. Obviously, there some library or script that is processing the file, making the image, and allowing nautilus to show a small version of it.\nThis made me think that in principle any file that potentially can be processed into an image can serve as a Nautilus thumbnail.\nFor example, a .tex file (which can be converted to .pdf) or a gnuplot script can be displayed as a thumbnail when possible.\nIn the case of .tex file, the correspoding .pdf can be created by the command pdflatex file.tex. \nThe question is, how can I tell Nautilus to create a thumbnail for an arbitrary format and how do I specify the commands to do so within Nautilus?\n\nUpdate 2014,\nI still didn't manage to preview anything with the answer posted, I created this script in /usr/bin/tex-thumbnailer:\npdflatex $1\nconvert -density 300 ${1%.*}.pdf -resize 25% $2\n\nand a file /usr/share/thumbnailers/tex.thumbnailer:\n[Thumbnailer Entry]\nTryExec=tex-thumbnailer\nExec=tex-thumbnailer %u %o\nMimeType=text/x-tex;\n\nI can't make nautilus to generate/show the preview even for simple TeX files. I don't know what I am doing wrong.\n\nA: Here's the documentation on how to add a new thumbnailer.\nYou need to add two keys on gconf:\n\n\n*\n\n*/desktop/gnome/thumbnailers/application@x-foo/enable (boolean)\n\n*/desktop/gnome/thumbnailers/application@x-foo/command (string)\n\n\nWhere application@x-foo is the MimeType for the kind of file you want to generate the thumbnails. Set enable to True and command to the command to create the thumbnail.\nTo add one with gconftool-2:\ngconftool-2 --set /desktop/gnome/thumbnailers/application@x-foo/enable --type bool true\ngconftool-2 --set /desktop/gnome/thumbnailers/application@x-foo/command --type string \"application-x-foo-thumbnailer %i %o %s\"\n\nThe folders are created automatically. %i is the input file, %o where to write the output file (png) and %s the size of the thumbnail.\nAnd here's how to add a MimeType for custom files.\n\nI found another way which seems easier, you can create a file in /usr/share/thumbnailers/ for example foo.thumbnailer:\n[Thumbnailer Entry]\nTryExec=/usr/bin/application-x-foo-thumbnailer\nExec=/usr/bin/application-x-foo-thumbnailer %i %o %s\nMimeType=application/x-foo;\n\nYou can separate several MimeTypes with ;.\n", "Q: I'm trying to install postgresql on 12.04, and it's just not working I've got a new installation and I'm trying to get Postgresql working.\nThe database was installed and I started a restoration from a dump on another machine, but that ran into problems because I had forgotten to install the \"contrib\" package.

When booting into Ubuntu, the operating system sees the Windows 7 hard drive. How do I disable or unmount this hard drive so that Ubuntu ignores my Windows 7 hard drive completely everytime I boot into Ubuntu??\n\nA: You could go into your system's BIOS and disable the windows 7 hard drive, then when you run Ubuntu, run sudo update-grub to regenerate the GRUB configuration for the menu, minus windows, since it won't be detected.\nThen, if you ever want to access the Windows drive, you would enable it in your BIOS.\nIt's not clear if this is your desired outcome, though.

(Maybe the right question is: What is the voodoo that quickly sets up in order to run the app? Does quickly expose this API so that I can call it from my test?)\n\nA: This makes me feel dirty, but it seems to be a viable workaround:\nclass TestMyappClose(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_close(self):\n        launchapp('/usr/bin/quickly', ['run'])\n        exists = waittillguiexist('*myapp', guiTimeOut=5)\n        assert(exists == 1)\n\n        selectmenuitem ('*myapp', 'mnuFile;mnuClose')\n        waittillguinotexist('*myapp')\n\n\nA: If you created it using Quickly (the app), \"quickly run\" (after cd'ing into the folder) will almost always work.

With help from this site, I was able to set up an SSHFS connection between two computers on my LAN so that one auto mounts on the other at boot time.\nEverything works, but there is this annoying confirmation that comes up whenever I boot:\n\n\nAn error occurred while mounting /home/dave/Mythbuntu.\nPress S to skip mounting or M or Manual recovery\n\nIf I press S, then booting continues, and my drive is mounted as hoped, so it seems like even though I \"skipped\" it, maybe it tried again and succeeded later in the boot process.\nI followed the instructions here to set up \"if up / if down\" scripts, and here is my current /etc/fstab:\nsshfs#mythbuntu@192.168.0.4:/home/mythbuntu    /home/dave/Mythbuntu    fuse    auto,users,exec,uid=1000,gid=1000,allow_other,reconnect,transform_symlinks,BatchMode=yes 0 0\n\nAlthough the mounting is working, this step of having to press S every time I boot is obviously kind of a hassle. How do I configure my computer so I don't have to do that, and so that my other computer will still automount?\n\nA: Since you've set up the ifup/ifdown scripts to bring SSHFS up/down with your network interface, there is no need for the system to attempt to mount it at boot via /etc/fstab; the drive still mounts because the ifup script is called after plain mount fails but before you get to your desktop.\nThe solution is simply to replace the auto option for SSHFS in /etc/fstab with noauto.\n", "Q: How do I write unicode charcaters in console mode?

But it is not only the login, notification, but also when talking to somebody. I tried the solution to remove/re-install skype and most of the solutions in this questions, e.g. checking mixer, sound settings and installing alsa-hda-dkms (incl. system restart).\nAfter installing skype (and even after upgrade to skype 4.0) in Ubuntu 12.04 (AMD 64) there was no sound at all. I followed the first step of the SoundTroubleshootingProcedure and at least there is now sound:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-audio-dev/ppa; sudo apt-get update;sudo apt-get dist-upgrade; sudo apt-get install linux-sound-base alsa-base alsa-utils gdm ubuntu-desktop  linux-image-`uname -r` libasound2; sudo apt-get -y --reinstall install linux-sound-base alsa-base alsa-utils gdm ubuntu-desktop  linux-image-`uname -r` libasound2; killall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.pulse*; sudo usermod -aG `cat /etc/group | grep -e '^pulse:' -e '^audio:' -e '^pulse-access:' -e '^pulse-rt:' -e '^video:' | awk -F: '{print $1}' | tr '\\n' ',' | sed 's:,$::g'` `whoami`\n\nThe jittering sound would sometimes disappear, e.g. on the Echo-Testcall after replaying the recorded part. And I noticed that if I let music play in the rhythmbox and then start skype, the sound is fine. So I have a weak solution, but I would be glad it would work without this detour.\nIn VLC when I play, restart after pause I have to same jittering sound.\nAs requested: My sound card is a an \"AMD High Definition Audio Device\" called Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Hudson Azalia controller (rev01), subsystem Lenovo Device 21ea (according to sysinfo) on a Lenovo Thinkpad Edge 525.\n\nA: It's not just a problem with Skype, I believe it's a problem with, you've guessed it, PulseAudio.\nWorkaround? Indeed there is.\nDisabling PulseAudio's Glitch Free Audio seems to have solved the crackling for me (which became unbearable on Ubuntu 12.10 Beta 2)\nTo do this, edit the /etc/pulse/default.pa file in your favourite text editor.\nSearch for the following line:\nload-module module-hal-detect\n\nand append \"tsched=0\" to the end:\nload-module module-hal-detect tsched=0\n\nrestart pulse (or just reboot your system), and the crackling should be gone.\nNot sure what the side effects are by disabling Glitch Free Audio, but I can't seem to find any yet.\nUPDATE:\nIf you don't have a line with load-module module-hal-detect, then search for following line:  \nload-module module-udev-detect  \n\nand append \"tsched=0\" to the end:\nload-module module-udev-detect tsched=0\n\nrestart pulse (or just reboot your system), and the crackling should be gone.\n\nA: If you suspect that it's pulseaudio causing you the problems, there might be an easier fix for you. I posted an article with step by step directions on my blog on how to fix bad sound in Ubuntu. This is a fix for Wine, but since it's a modification of a pulseaudio configuration file, it might be applicable to other similar problems.\n\nA: The solution provided above by Robert worked for me.  I had updgraded to 12.10 ubuntu and the new skype 4.0 upgrade had unusable sound (scratchy and distorted).  editing per the instructions above and appending the following line to:\nload-module module-hal-detect tsched=0   in the /etc/pulse/default.pa file resolved the issue perfectly.   \nFor awareness, the upgrade to 12.10 caused the recognition of my Soundblaster card to fail to be the default.  For some reason it now defaulted to thinking my NVIDIA graphics card was the default sound card.  Skype would initially make NO sound.\nThis can be corrected by following the directions in the Ubuntu forums post by billesboelle July 27, 2008.  Here repeated for inclusiveness:\nI can't get Ubuntu to default select the pci card, after trying the settings from complete soundprob guide as below:\nIt seems the index=0 function doesn't want to help me.\nMaybe its due to the fact that my machine registres 2 sound drivers with same name ?\ncat /proc/asound/modules gives this response:  \n0 snd_hda_intel  \n1 snd_hda_intel  \n2 snd_cmipci  \n\nAny ideas,or something you wanna see before being able to help me.\nBtw, forgot to mention.\nIf i try the index option, my pci can is removed from aplay -l and cat /proc/asound/modules.\nConfiguring default soundcards / stopping multiple soundcards from switching\nNote: This section assumes that you have installed each soundcard properly.\nIn a shell, type\n    cat /proc/asound/modules \n\nThis will give the the name and index of each sound card you have currently. Make a note of the names, and decide which one you want to be the default card.\nNow type\n    sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base\n\nAt the very end of the file, add the following (assuming you have 3 cards with module names A, B and C and you want to have them in the order CAB)\noptions snd-C index=0  \noptions snd-A index=1  \noptions snd-B index=2\n\n\nA: Fix for ubuntu 16.04\nsudo vim /etc/pulse/daemon.conf\nfind default-fragment-size-msec, in my case it was disabled, so remove ; at the begin of line, so it should look like default-fragment-size-msec = 5 (I replaced default value 25 by 5).\nThen just kill service pulseaudio --kill and ubuntu will restart pulseaudio, if it didn't happen by any reason, then just restart system.\nNow I can hear skype voice very clear.\n\nA: Had the same issue on Archlinux. Turned out pulseaudio was causing this. Getting rid of pulseaudio restored clear sound in Skype for me. For Gnome-based distros like mainline Ubuntu it is probably impossible to remove pulseaudio since it is a dependency for most of the gnome stuff, including gdm, but on kubuntu, xubuntu and lubuntu this might actually work since they initially don't come with pulseaudio and the gnome bloatware, and if it got installed most likely it happened as a dependency for some other package that depends on gnome or its libraries.\n\nA: I just removed pulseaudio from ubuntu 12.04 on my toshiba p875-s7200 and it fixed skype beautifully! sound went from crap to awesome :)\nnote: I had to install alsa-hda-dkms to get sound at all on this laptop \n\nA: This worked for me, ubuntu 12.10 /64, mb asus m4a785tdv-evo  amd64 (audio VIA VT1708S)\nedited the /etc/pulse/default.pa (sudo pico /etc/pulse/default.pa)\ncould not find load-module module-hal-detect\nso i just edited the line load-module module-udev-detect, so to have :\nload-module module-udev-detect tsched=0\nsaved changes and restarted the system.  Now Skype seems fine. until now I had problems when using Skype with crackling/echo/noise which sometimes adjusted/stopped during the conversation (sometimes it fixed when closing the web browser) but sometimes it kept going all the time heavily compromising the conversation. Skype apparently was the only situation with audio problems for me.\n\nA: Neither of the solutions posted so far worked for me on 14.04, but setting the audio module to alsa in Preferences->Audio->Output fixed it for me on vlc.\n\nA: You should check your internet connection (http://www.speedtest.net for speed test).\nAlso, as it works after RyhthmBox you could also try to update drivers (for sound card).\nIt could also help other answerers if you told us what kind of sound card you have in your computer.\n", "Q: How to get HDMI sound work on a basic 12.04 install? I have just installed Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise) and am using it on my TV.

I am also running Windows Xp on the computer.\n\nA: HDMI output is muted by default (at least on my laptop). Open the Sound Settings (click the speaker icon on the top panel to get to the settings). In the Output tab, an HDMI output should appear when the hdmi cable is connected. Select this, then adjust the volume slider at the bottom of the window.\n\nA: It may vary depending on your Laptop/PC environment. Some older HW hadn't got audio via HDMI, but SPIDF instead. Like HP DV2700\n\nA: Try installing the newest Kernel 3.5 from http://www.kernel.org/ (choose the right version, 32 or 64 bit). Reboot and see if that works. I did that with my laptop and fixed my sound problem. If it doesn't work, you can always delete it from the sypnatics package manager, assuming you have installed that from the software center.\n", "Q: Keyboard layout hung up I have a problem with the keyboard layout. I use Ubuntu 12.04. I configured the layout so that I could interchange between a Norwegian and Hebrew keyboard. The system language of my Ubuntu is Norwegian and both my user name and password are written in latin characters. I had been typing Hebrew for some while, then I left the computer for a break. When I came back, I had to unlock the account but then the keyboard layout was locked in a Hebrew keyboard layout and I could not switch back to Norwegian. I tried to reboot the machine and to turn it off and on but not matter what I did I could only type Hebrew letters. So it was impossible for me to login with my own account which had a password written with latin characters. Finally I gave up and installed Ubuntu from scratch. Now I would like to be able to change between Hebrew and Norwegian keyboard layouts but I don't dare to do it before I know what went wrong.\nAny solutions?\n\nA: If you can only see the small box with a password field, you should click \"Switch user\".

The installation for 12.04 kept failing, and the solution was to have the installer ignore the btrfs partition that I have previously been using for /home.\nNow that it's installed, I've been trying to get it to mount the btrfs partition so that I can access my 70GB of files.  It won't mount, and btrfsck errors out with the following three lines:\nparent transid verify failed on 31302336512 wanted 62455 found 62456\nparent transid verify failed on 31302336512 wanted 62455 found 62456\nparent transid verify failed on 31302336512 wanted 62455 found 62456\n\nCan someone please tell me how to get this partition working?  I've read online that I can probably recover the data using btrfs-restore, but I can't find that program anywhere.\n\nA: Mount on boot using root fs mount options:\nrootflags=recovery,nospace_cache\n\nor\nrootflags=recovery,nospace_cache,clear_cache\n\nThe full list of btrfs mount options should be here https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Mount_options and other things may be useful also, such as noatime,nodatacow (fixed a kernel bug for me giving me a chance to copy my files).\nAdd it to your grub.cfg / menu.lst, or type it in when booting.\nThe nospace_cache stuff will make things terribly slow. Just boot up, wait (long), shut down, and boot normally.\nI had the same thing a few days ago, and the above fixed it. But also afterwards, there were some space issues... the space reported is not 100% but it can still say out of space.\n==\nI think you can also add the same options in your fstab, for example:\nUUID=0237alksfadg-lhdfkj3624-4fdfjb-9dsfe2d-dfddaf /home btrfs defaults,recovery,nospace_cache,clear_cache,subvol=@home 0  \n 2\n\nIf you were trying to recover a /home directory mounted over a partition with UUID=0237alksfadg-lhdfkj3624-4fdfjb-9dsfe2d-dfddaf.\n\nA: Peter's answer solved the problem for me, although not on Ubuntu.\nI had a /home partition btrfs'd that got of course corrupted.\nThe system would not boot up because it was on fstab.\nI entered maintenance mode, hashed out the line with that partition, and booted up normally( I had a spare ext4 partition I could use as /home).\nI mounted the partition manually with the following command :\nmount -t btrfs -o recovery,nospace_cache,nospace_cache /dev/sda3 /mnt/sda3 and was actually able to save my data. Although it did not take that long to mount it. So THANKS Peter.\n\nA: Easiest way\nbtrfs-zero-log /dev/sda5\n\nYour getting that issue because a transaction(write or delete) is stuck in the journal log and the disk doesnt match it.\nHow it works:\nSo when data is written 1st its written to journal then to disk (or at same time, but journal just saves metadata about the upcoming write - not sure... need more research on that part)...\nAnyhow if you turn off the system in the middle of this write/delete or do something that hickups the system (dismount the USB that holds your btrfs mount point), then when it returns that mount will not work it will fail (dmesg and btrfsck will show you the errors in more detail)...\nLooking at dmesg you will see those same transid messages.\nYou will see something like this:\nparent transid verify failed on 109973766144 wanted 1823 found 1821\n\nIt means that btrfs wanted transid 1823 (That was on the journal) but on the disk it saw 1821. So the disk was 2 transactions away from being in sync with journal. I personally would risk a brtfs-zero-log here just because its only 2 transactions. But to be 100% safe if this is your only data (by the way if you have critical data you should NEVER EVER have only 1 copy of it, always have a copy/backup in a safe other location - blaming the creators of btrfs wouldnt justify against the persons own lack of responsibility of not having a backup - btrfs is not backup solution, its a filesystem - nothing is a true backup solution besides having a copy of it else where - not even parity or mirrored drives, a true backup is sitting somewhere underground in the Alps while its active copy is in your office in Texas)\nparent transid verify failed on 31302336512 wanted 62455 found 62456\n\nHere the journal is wanting 62455 but the disk is one ahead at 62456, so in your case i would just clear the journal. Journal didnt update this time. Again I told you bout being safe thing, if its your only data and its mega critical (shame on you), and I would do the below operations first to be safe.\nRunning a btrfsck /dev/sda5 (which by the way just does a readonly check so its completely safe, its only btrfsck options that you have to worry about) will also show you those messages.\nBut beware if that data is critical, i would first do (As the other gents said)\nmount -t btrfs -o rootflags=recovery,nospace_cache /dev/sda3 /mnt/sda3\n\nmount -t btrfs -o rootflags=recovery,nospace_cache,clear_cache /dev/sda3 /mnt/sda3\n\nmount -t btrfs -o recovery,nospace_cache,clear_cache /dev/sda3 /mnt/sda3\n\nThen cp or rsync all of your files over to safe location, then when safe do the btrfs-zero-log, if its a successful operation you just wasted alot of time backing up your system (but if its not successful, you just saved your arse)\nThen if the mounts failed do a btrfs restore (dump of the system, as I understand its a resumeable operation, however it keeps asking for Y or y every now and again so watch the output)\nbtrfs restore /dev/sda5 /USB\n\nThen when safe (when btrfs restore is done) do the btrfs-zero-log, if its a successful operation you just wasted alot of time backing up your system (but if its not successful, you just saved your arse)\nYou can run screen first\nscreen /bin/bash\n\nbtrfs restore /dev/sda5 /USB\n\nSCREEN SIDE NOTE\nTo detach (command will still run): CONTROL-a then type \":detach\" without the quotes then press ENTER\nAnother way to detach: Then close out of putty or your terminal and it will detach (the command / restore will still run).\nTo check up on it, just screen back to it:\nscreen -x\n\nscreen -x will attach to sessions, even if detached, and unlike -h says, it will attach even if its already attached as well)\nIf you have several screens, screen -x will tell you need to be more specific to attach to the session:\nscreen -ls\n\nls for list all sessions, easy to remember that.\nto see the PID you can also do this:\nps aux | grep screen\n\nOnce you find out your PID, then run screen like this:\nscreen -x PID\n\nThat will attach to a specific session. You can have several sessions/puttys attached to the same screen (they will output the same text, you can type commands in one, and they will be mirrored on the other putty)\n\nA: I had the same problem. After a reboot I was no longer able to mount my btrfs partition. However none of the solutions mentioned here could solve it.\nWhat did fix it for me was upgrading the kernel from 3.10 to 3.12. After a reboot the btrfs partition could be mounted again.\n\nA: Had unmontable btrfs encrypted, was fighting with that whole month, UNRAID\nerrors like - no valid btrfs file system, no file system etc + similiar to this:\nparent transid verify failed on 31302336512 wanted 62455 found 62456\nI was mounting in read only, maintenance modes, rescue, recovery...\nsolution was simplest ever:\nsudo mkdir -p /mnt/diskX # X corespond to +1 higher number already taken\nmount -t btrfs -o recovery,nospace_cache,nospace_cache /dev/sde1 /mnt/diskX\nwhen it mounted, and data was visible in SMB and in terminal, just copied it to other disk, and this one recycled.\n", "Q: How do I skip the Grub menu on a dual-boot system?

Thanks!\n\nA: This seems to work, though you must understand that it isn't replacing pulseaudio with alsa but just removing pulseaudio(the front-end).\nsudo apt-get autoremove pulseaudio\n\nHowever alsa still needs a graphical user interface for you to easily communicate with it\nsay goodbye to the easy integrated indicator that Ubuntu comes with\nsudo apt-get install gnome-alsamixer\n\nYou can also do all of this in the Ubuntu Software Centre.\n\nA: I solved my problem after months and months of not being able to get it working properly. \nThe only way I could get the mic to work with Skype was to switch off Pulse by setting 'autospawn=off', and then I'd lose my lovely desktop volume control, until:-\nI discovered that this laptop has \"stereo, or mono\" input via the built in microphone (sorry, can't remember which), but the solution was to open pavucontrol, split the channels on the input (microphone) and reduce the volume of one of the channels to zero. Works perfectly, haven't had a problem since. I now use Alsa and Pulse, all normal and I have all the useful sound controls of pulse with the alsa backend.\n", "Q: How to make Machinarium work again? I am on Ubuntu 12.04 (64b) and bought Machinarium a while ago. I played with no problems for some days and wanted to play again today. However, when I tried to play, I got this error:\n./Machinarium: error while loading shared libraries: libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nHow can I solve it?\n\nA: It's a 32-bit binary and requires the 32-bit version of libgtk. Make sure that the package libgtk2.0-0:i386 is installed.\nsudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-0:i386\n\nUpdate:\nThough you'll need other libraries as well and if that library is missing, the other 32-bit libraries are probably missing as well, thus\nsudo apt-get install ia32-libs\n\nia32-libs depend on a lot of 32-bit libraries which gets installed when you install it.\n\nA: ia32-libs is obsolote in the latest Ubuntu versions. To fix Machinarium, install the missing 32 bit libraries this way:\nsudo apt-get install libnss3.s:i386 libcurl3:i386 libgtk2.0-0:i386\n\n", "Q: How can I open a file in my terminal, like nautilus does it? I want to be able to open files like my operating system does from console.\ne.g. a .pdf file should be opened with evince or whatever the default application to open pdfs is. All the other things should work too; images -> eog, text files -> gedit and so on. \nI hope that there is a solution for this, it would be really practical.\n\nA: You can use xdg-open to open any file type your desktop environment knows about, for example\nxdg-open somefile.pdf\n\n\nA: *\n\n*gnome-open opens a file with Gnome's default application\n\n*kde-open opens a file with KDE's default application\n\n*xdg-open opens a file with X's default application\n\n\nA: Very useful! I added a bit to this, and created a shell script \"open\". Essentially, if there is no argument to open, or if the argument to open is a directory, you use nautilus, else the xdg-open command:\nbash version:\n#! /bin/bash\n#\n#  this emulates the mac 'open' command, which figures out fromthe\n#  file how to 'display' a file\n#\n#  gnome-open   kde-open    xdg-open\n\nif [ $* > 0 ] ; then\n  if [ -d $1 ] ; then\n    nautilus $1\n  else\n    xdg-open $*\n  fi\nelse\n  nautilus .\nfi\n\ncsh version:\n#! /bin/csh -f\n#\n#  this emulates the mac 'open' command, which figures out fromthe\n#  file how to 'display' a file\n#\n#  gnome-open   kde-open    xdg-open\n\nif ($#argv > 0) then\n  if (-d $1) then\n    nautilus $1\n  else\n    xdg-open $*\n  endif\nelse\n  nautilus .\nendif\n\n\nA: Well if you mean command with what you can open everything, it will choose automatically, there is gnome-open\nIf you want to open .pdf or whatever file it is, just type:\ngnome-open blah.pdf\n\nAnd there is xdg-open for this kinda works. What it does: it just looks what is default application for such type of files, and runs that app.\n\nIn manual of xdg-open\nxdg-open - opens a file or URL in the user's preferred application\n\nAlso from here\n\nxdg-open is part of the xdg-utils package available in [extra]. xdg-open is for use inside a desktop session only. It is not recommended to use xdg-open as root.\n\nAnd sure to change \"default\" application, you will need xdg-mime\nExample to change default pdf viewer:\n$ xdg-mime default xpdf.desktop application/pdf\n\nSource: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xdg-open\n\nA: To add to the existing points.\nI find this command so important that I have an alias in ~/.bashrc:\nalias go='xdg-open'\n\nI also find the command xdg-open . or with the alias go . really useful. The period represents the working directory, and it opens Nautilus in the working directory. Thus, if you need to temporarily take advantage of features in Nautilus, such as opening files in alternate programs, deleting files with strange names, selecting strange combinations of files, etc. then you can do that in a relatively simple way. \n\nA: You can use xdg-open, it should open a file with the default program:\nxdg-open somename.pdf\n\nwill open somename with your default pdf reader.\nOr, usually, you can just use the program name followed by the name (or path and name) of the file that you wish to open\nevince somename.pdf\n\nwill open somename in evince.\nIf you want to be able to keep using the terminal while working with the file you can add & at the end of the command, it will be executed in the background and you can continue tying commands in the terminal. Otherwise you can't use the terminal until the program is closed.\nxdg-open somename.pdf &\n\n\nA: \nxdg-open — opens a file or URL in the user's preferred application\n\nBut what if you want to change the preferred application from the terminal?\nTry this\nYou can use the xdg-mime program to first check which is the current default application that will open a file and then you can switch it to what ever application you want.\n$ xdg-mime query default application/pdf\nAdobeReader.desktop\n$ xdg-mime default evince.desktop application/pdf\n$ xdg-mime query default application/pdf\nevince.desktop\n\nNow as mentioned by jokerdino you can use xdg-open to open a file with your preferred application:\n$ xdg-open file.pdf\n\n\nA: There is a terminal file manager called Midnight Commander .\nsudo apt-get install mc\n\nIt allows you to browse files and opens files with default applications.\nBut it is more like a file manager not like the xdg-open \n", "Q: Script for filing call recordings into date folders We have an IP PBX that is running Asterisk and is set by the manufacturer to delete call recordings after a certain time period.

The cables / router ports / wifi adapter / access point are all known good and work with other equipment. I suspected a failed NIC but seeing how the wireless connections also aren't working via USB wifi adapter, that eliminates the NIC as a possible source of the issue. What other hardware might be shared between the wired (onboard NIC) and wireless (USB wifi adapter)? I stress that with the wifi adapter I see other networks, but cannot get an IP address from them either. Testing with a Kubuntu 11.10 LiveCD has the same results.\nI notice that there is no /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf file.\n\nA: Try sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-client, which will install the dhcp client, though it won't explain why it wasn't installed to begin with.  This also presumes that your problem is a lack of said client.\nIf that doesn't work, you should look into using the tcpdump command on one of the interfaces and post back here with the results.  For example, sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -n should show you if there is any traffic passing over the eth0 interface, though you may need to correct for the right interface.\nSince tcpdump didn't see any traffic, start the tcpcommand again, unplug your LAN connection, wait a couple seconds for the computer to realize you've unplugged it, then plug it back in and look at the tcpdump output.  There should be several DHCP request sent out by you're computer, and under ideal circumstances, responses to those queries as well.  If you don't see anything at all, then perhaps DHCP is request an address on the wrong port, maybe check DHCP configuration.  If after checking your DHCP configuration you're sure that DHCP is requesting an address on the correct port but that you're not seeing any traffic with tcpdump, check the logs for any errors related to DHCP or errors transmitting network traffic.  If nothing is obvious, post the logs here. \nBeyond that, I don't know what else to do to diagnose this, perhaps your suspicions of faulty hardware were correct, or more unlikely, driver trouble.\n\nA: The problem was in fact syndrome of issues:\n1) No kernel support for this NIC in the -23 kernel. Downloading and installing the -26 kernel helped.\n2) DHCP problems even with the NIC recognised. I had issues with DHCP on this hardware in openSuse 12.1 as well. Settings a static IP address got the machine online but no DNS.\n3) To get DNS working, I renewed the DHCP lease even though I have a static IP address. This sounds stupid but it works. Simply configuring Google's public DNS servers did not resolve the issue.\nTo add insults to injury, this motherboard (ASUS P8H61-M LX) does not have PCI port to plug a NIC card into. ASUS support took two days to answer my letter of Linux support with \"we don't support Linux\" and the Realtek site's Linux NIC drivers wouldn't download from any of the six mirrors. They use JavaScript and HTTP access controls to prevent one from downloading the tarball over wget on a real server that I maintain, so I had a colleague download from the US and email the drivers to me. Then I couldn't build them as I could not install gcc from the Kubuntu DVD.\nTL;DR: Don't buy an ASUS motherboard, they officially don't support Linux. And in any case, don't buy a motherboard without a PCI slot!\n\nA: CULPRIT: Copying of files \"/etc/NetworkManager/\" from the previous installation\nProblem: My system had no access to the domain name servers (DNS), provided by my IP provider after a new install of Ubuntu 18.04. No Internet connection. Tests showed: Providing a fixed DNS (such as Google's 8.8.8.8) as described above gave internet connection. The connection to my router worked. The router had the DNS.\nAfter hours I found out: The problem was that I had copied the folder and subfolders \"/etc/NetworkManager\" from my old installation into this new installation, because I did not want to lose all the installed Wifi connections. And THAT was the culprit.\nSolution:\nA. Creating a new instance of /etc/NetworkManager\n\n*\n\n*I renamed /etc/NetworkManager to /etc/NetworkManager-1/.\n\n*I reinstalled my Wifi connection at home: Network name, DHCP, password.\n\n*Result: a new instance of /etc/NetworkManager had been created. The network\nsettings were in a file in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections. Now everything worked!\n\nB. Saving my old Wifi connections\n\n*\n\n*I went into my old (renamed) NetworkManager files under /etc/NetworkManager-1/. In the folder /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections were all the connections (one file per connection) I had gathered during the time of the old installation. I copied these files onto the clipboard.\n\n*I went into /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections, i.e. the same folder of the new NetworkManager. I acquired superuser privileges (\"open as system administrator\") and pasted the files from the clipboard into this directory.\n\n*I made sure that these files had the owner \"root\" and the permissions \"600\", that is owner root can read and write, \"group root\" and \"others\" have no permissions whatsoever. In my case I had to change the permissions. I opened a terminal and did \"sudo chmod 600 /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/*.\n\n", "Q: PlayonLinux install menu is empty I am using Ubuntu 12.04.\nI installed PlayOnLinux by adding their repository to Software Sources.

I want to know how to install LibreOffice 3.5.4 in Ubuntu 12.04. I heard that it has many improvements over its earlier versions.\n\nA: Libreoffice 3.5.4 is currently in precise-proposed repository. If I were you, I would just wait for it until it gets into the precise-updates repository and then you can simply upgrade your system as usual. But if you are quite desperate to try it out sooner, you can follow these instructions to use 3.5.4. You don't have to install an additional PPA, which makes it even better.\n\nFirst of all, you have to enable precise-proposed repository. It is not enabled by default for various stability issues as the repository usually contains software that are not tested enough. \nTo enable precise-proposed, open Ubuntu Software Center → Edit → Software Sources → Updates and ensure that precise-proposed is enabled.\n\nAfter enabling the proposed, use this command to install LibreOffice 3.5.4:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libreoffice/precise-proposed\n\n\nA: Ok, I've solved the problem that Libre office doesn't work after I've upgraded to Ubuntu 12.04.\nThis question has been marked as a replacement for this question: Cannot install LibreOffice - however that question contains information that is vital to the problem solving, at least it was for me, so... perhaps marking questions as duplicates AND making sure the information is in the sanctioned and preferred question should be the policy here?\nAnyway, I started out with Libre from a PPA in Ubuntu 10.04 (I wouldn't have, had I known it was such a fuss so my goal when trying to solve this problem was primarily to get Libre to work, and secondarily to get it to work without any PPA:s, both regardless of version of Libre).\nMy first symptom that something was broken was when I tried to open a document and Libre crashed and Ubuntu wanted to make an error report.\nI then started to try to reinstall/install libre but got errors on the theme of: \nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n libreoffice : Depends: BLABLABLA!*# but it is not going to be installed\n               Depends: ... but it is not going to be installed\n\nUnfortunately I rebooted my computer before I thought to save the exact error message.\nI started by removing all PPA:s (in fact I first tried a bunch of them but it didn't help).\nThen I updated and upgraded to the latest versions of things:\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nI also ran autoremove:\nsudo apt-get autoremove\n\nWhen still failing to install, I removed Libreoffice as completely as I could.\nI did this by opening Synaptic Package manager and then searching for libreoffice and removing everything (Mark for removal) that seemed to have anything with libre to do.\nMarking libreoffice-core for removal seems to take care of most of the packages.\nI guess I could have used sudo apt-get remove --purge libreoffice-core as well but I didn't do that to get this exact result - try it if you feel experimental...\nNext I did another run of update, upgrade and autoremove as listed above, just to be sure.

Most likely, it will be your Downloads folder.\nThen Just press Ctrl+Alt+T on your keyboard to open Terminal. When it opens, run the command below.\nsudo apt-get remove --purge libreoffice-core\n\nTo remove previous version, if they exist.  Then navigate to the folder where you downloaded the file, and extract it.  Once you do that, open terminal again, navigate to the newly created folder, and run the commands below:\nsudo dpkg -i *.deb  \ncd desktop-integration \nsudo dpkg -i *.deb\n\nAnd Libreoffice will be installed.\n\nA: Open a terminal window under Applications > Accessories > Terminal. Type \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa\n\nOnce the repository is added, we need to let the system know about the new packages available. Update the packages list by typing \nsudo apt-get update \n\nWhen finished, install the latest version of libreoffice package by typing \nsudo apt-get install libreoffice\n\n", "Q: Is the 2.4MB Wubi Installer blocked in China? Using an existing Wubi will download all the files successfully, however the OS will be unable to install because of bad files. Is the mirror site of Ubuntu installation files GFWed in China?\n\nA: If you are in China and you tried to download Ubuntu from the Main Servers, you may get a corrupted copy because the servers are usually located in the US or the UK.\nIt is possible that the GFW can block the servers, though.  So I would suggest you to download from the cn99 mirror in China and do a full install with the official Ubuntu Image. \n32-bit CD: ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.iso\n64-bit CD: ubuntu-12.04-desktop-amd64.iso\nWubi:  wubi.exe\n\nA: You have a few options.\nTry Installing From a Full Ubuntu .iso\nYou can download a full Ubuntu .iso image and install Wubi from that (either by burning it to a CD/DVD or USB flash drive and reading it from that, or by mounting the image in Windows). This may work if Wubi.exe, downloaded by itself, cannot retrieve good files.\nTry Downloading a Current wubi.exe (Or .iso Image) From a Different Mirror\nThere are a number of different mirrors from which the Wubi installer, or full .iso images, can be downloaded. It is possible that some of them are blocked in the PRC. If this is the case, you should be able to download the software by using a different mirror, or perhaps by using the main download site. There is a list of mirrors at the bottom of this page. And this is the main download site.\nIf you need more detailed help picking the right file from any mirror or the main site, please comment to let me know and I can expand this answer further (based on the specific assistance you request).\nProvide More Detailed Information\nAlternatively, please edit your question to include the complete and exact text of any error messages.

I've been a Linux user for a while, and C++ programmer for a while longer.  Is there a way to write applications for Ubuntu, and how to submit them?\n\nA: To write applications for Ubuntu, you can use Quickly. It is for apps in Python and GTK. But you can also write applications with other frameworks that works on Linux (Qt for example).\nAll the informations that you need are on the Ubuntu Developer website : http://developer.ubuntu.com/\n", "Q: How to view cd contents I know its a stupid question but I'm new to ubuntu. isn't a window supposed to pop up and say cd inserted or something as in windows. I looked up in the file browser but there is nothing related to cd drive. is the problem with my drive ? \n\nA: Here is how it looks when you mount cd in ubuntu 12.04. Did you try putting different cd/dvd in your drive?\n\n\nA: The CD should appear under Devices in any Nautilus (file browser) window. If it doesn't, then there are a few possibilities:\n\n\n*\n\n*It could be an audio CD, rather than a data CD. Then you can listen to it or rip it in Rhythmbox, Sound Juicer, or whatever other application you prefer.\n\n*The CD could have no readable filesystems. This could be due to damage to the CD, or a problem with your CD drive, or a problem with your Ubuntu system. You can troubleshoot this sort of problem by inserting the CD, waiting about 10 seconds, opening a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T), and running the command dmesg | tail -20. That shows the last 20 lines of system messages, which may document any problems and/or reveal if the CD is being detected at all.\n\n*There could be a problem with Nautilus, though this is not very common. You can run mount in a Terminal window to view all mounted devices, and see if the CD is mounted.\n\n*It could be a blank CD-R (or CD-RW). Typically a blank disc will pop up a message asking you what you want to do, but this behavior can be disabled. If you know it's a blank disc and your intention is to write something to it, then you can burn files (or an .iso image) to it with CD burning software available in Ubuntu, such as Brasero.\nYou may want to add more information to your question (including the results of running the dmesg and mount commands above). That might make possible an answer more specific to your situation.\n", "Q: Google Chrome 20: How to workaround poor performance with Flash?

Is there a command I can use?\n\nA: All the repositories are listed in the .list files in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory.\n\nA: There are two different places in Debian for source list files:\nMost of the default source listings are in\n/etc/apt/sources.list\n\nWhile a few packages may add their own smaller lists to\n/etc/apt/sources.list.d/\n\nTo view each of them, you can cat them individually. (like cat /etc/apt/sources.list, or cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*)\nThis is quite a familiar style in debian packaging. For instance apache keeps its common configuration in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf, while several other packages (like phpmyadmin) may add their own smaller configurations in /etc/apache2/conf.d/\n\nA: This command will list them quite clearly and nicely:\nfor X in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*; do echo; echo; echo \"** $X:\"; echo; cat $X; done\n\n(Here's an example of what the output can look like.)\nYou may also want to list the repositories configured in the master configuration file:\ncat /etc/apt/sources.list\n\n\nA: grep -EvRH ^\"$|\\#\" /etc/apt/source*\n\n\nA: I use the following:\ngrep -Rh ^deb /etc/apt/sources.li* | sort -u\n\n\n*\n\n*grep -Rh ^deb /etc/apt/sources.li* prints every line starting with the word \"deb\" in /etc/apt/sources.list and every file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d. The R is for \"recursive\" and the h suppresses the filenames because I don't want to see them.\n\n*sort -u sorts the input and removes duplicates. I put it in there because /etc/apt/sources.list.save exists on my system.

Is there any way I can run the Unity dashboard (or something similar, like Bolt for Gnome 3) in Gnome Fallback?\n\nA: Yes there is. You can run unity-2d-shell , just type Alt+F2 then enter in unity-2d-shell and it will give you the Unity 2d launcher and dashboard. To start it on start-up How to start applications at startup?\nHere is a picture of my Gnome fallback (no-effects) session using the unity dash-\n\nUnfortunately the dash is built into the launcher. But you can auto-hide the launcher, and turn down the reveal sensitivity so it be harder to show unless you access the dash.\nI found a way to hack it so the launcher does not appear,\n\n\n*\n\n*Open the shell.qml to edit, paste this in terminal   \ngksudo gedit /usr/share/unity-2d/shell/Shell.qml\n\n*Find this code in the file, scroll down a bit-  \nLauncherLoader {\n        id: launcherLoader\n        anchors.top: parent.top\n        anchors.bottom: parent.bottom\n        width: 65\n\n\n*Change the width: 65 to width: 1 \n\n*If you had the unity-2d-shell running while making the changes, in terminal do\nkillall unity-2d-shell then type Alt+F2 and enter unity-2d-shell to see the change, now the launcher is out of the way, and you can still acess the dash with the Meta (windows) key.\n\nA: You can run Unity3D or Unity2D.  But if you run Gnome \"classic\", you'll need something different.  If it's just the dashboard you're missing, and not the other features, then there are several alternatives, called \"docks\", that may start a battle by naming, but I'm an old soldier, so here are the ones I know about:\nAvant Window Navigator (also known as AWN), is in the repository and works well with Gnome classic, with or without Compiz;\nCairo Dock, in two flavors (GLX Dock with openGL, and standard Cairo Dock);\nDocky, a fairly simple dock that I haven't really used. \nThere are others, but if you search for either Gnome Docks, or the ones I mentioned, I'm sure you'll be led to many others.\nYou can also add the Cardapio menu to some of these, or use it by itself.  I is a very nice menu system, with pinned items, grouped apps, and a very nice search where you can press a hotkey to trigger the menu, then type one or two keys to find the app, and usually press return.  For example, if you want to run gparted, you can press the hotkey, type \"gp\", return.   For me, if I want to run VirtualBox, Windows XP, I just need to type \"XP\", return and it runs.\n", "Q: Is there a way to backup your package configuration? For example, if I wanted to help out with trying edge(in this case Quantal), but I wanted to be able to revert to a stable-ish system if some update caused a problem -- how would I accomlish this task?\n\nA: Configuration for your applications will be in folders whose names start with a dot, in your home folder.  Backing those up may be advisable, especially if you want to revert to Precise, as config formats may change in newer packages, and things.\nSystem-wide configuration is in /etc.  Ditto.\nYou can back up your package selections with dpkg --get-selections > /path/to/backup/file and restore them with dpkg --set-selections < /path/to/backup/file && sudo apt-get install, but note that you'll also need to backup several files from /etc/apt if you're using any non-default repositories.\nEDIT: If you don't have somewhere to do backups to, or you want to revert your system to exactly the way it was, package-versions and all, you have the following options (copied from my comments on the question):\nFor the release upgrade, there's the --sandbox flag for do-release-upgrade, which (AIUI) puts the changes in an aufs tmpfs, so you can roll it back without trouble. There may be a way to do this with the later apt-get upgrades: Remount your partitions as aufs or overlayfs (overlayfs is meant to be without some problems aufs has, but Ubuntu didn't consider it stable enough to use it by default, so that may be a consideration) bases and use either tmpfs (if you have a lot of RAM) or a spare partition as the writable overlay before doing the upgrade. I don't believe there's really anything simpler, but I could be wrong.  More information on this at this page - it's geared to USB Flash devices but should be useful even on \"proper\" hard drives.\nIf you choose certain filesystems at install time, you may be able to produce copy-on-write snapshots, enabling you to roll your entire system back to precisely its previous state.  Note, though, that the only fs I know to be able to do this is btrfs, which is very slow to run package-management on, because dpkg uses lots of fsync(), which is slow on btrfs.  This can be overcome by installing and using the \"eatmydata\" package, but that will make your system a lot harder to recover if it crashes or loses power in the middle of package-management operations.  Other filesystems may have the same snapshotting capability; you may want to research this.\n", "Q: GtkPositionType The problem is that I have to use function attach_next_to() on grid, but the optional parameter of that function is GtkPositioType for side on which I can attach some new widget od the grid.

It's up to a point sometimes that the text on TTYs is only barely visible. The brightness goes up again if I put other windows (like a regular Firefox-window) in front or when I make the \"problematic\" windows smaller. It also happens if a Browsser-window shows lots of dark/black background, but it seems that the effect is more severe the more of that darkness is shown.\nI use Ubuntu 12.04 and nVidia-drivers 302.17 (problem occured for many months, with 11.10 and older nVidia-drivers as well).\n\nA: This sounds like it's your monitor. Some monitors have a feature called \"dynamic contrast\" which basically adjusts the backlight based on what's on the screen. This way they can claim in their advertising that it has a ridiculously high contrast ratio. It may look nice in some places, depending on your preference.\nYou can probably turn this off. Fiddle with the controls on your monitor and there should be something about dynamic contrast in the menu.

There are a lot clients inside a LAN. The server is trusted, the clients are not.\nIt has to be ensured that other clients can not spoof another clients or the servers LAN IP address.\nI want to prevent to bothering with something like openvpn or ipsec, because encryption is not required (LAN) and those solutions are overkill and complicated to learn.\nAre there any simple alternatives?\n\nA: Due to the basic design of Ethernet you can not protect clients in the same broadcast domain from spoofing each other. Even though the switch that they are connected to will learn MAC address to port mappings and try to only send traffic to the correct port, there are tricks that can be pulled to spoof another station's MAC address and get their traffic. Look up tools like Ettercap.\nTherefore, you need to build your security model around segregating things that absolutely must not spoof each other into different VLANs. So for example you might put everything that only has admin access in one or more VLANs and put everything that has untrusted users into one or more other VLANs.\nInside each VLAN, traffic that absolutely must not be impersonated/sniffed by other stations in the same VLAN must use encryption at the transport layer.\n\nA: The easy alternative would be to place a firewall of some sort between the client and server LAN segments. Then you would want to configure the firewall with options around packet spoofing and such. I would configure and harden a version of Ubuntu server with IPTABLES enabled that sits between the clients and servers. I would configure the IPTABLES rules on an Ubuntu desktop using Firewall builder and then deploy the ruleset to the firewall server. That would be the cheap version. If you have some cash on hand I would order, install, and configure a hardware firewall such as Cisco ASA or a Checkpoint. \n", "Q: MacBook Pro 8.2 wifi keeps disconnecting, Ubuntu 12.04 I am using a MacBook Pro 8.2 with Ubuntu 12.04, and my wifi disconnects consistently. I followed the directions as detailed here here, however, and it works up to expected speeds, but after within an hours time, the wifi disconnects and the only way to solve the issue is to either reboot OR disable wireless and re-enable it.\nlsmod | grep cfg80211\n\noutputs:\ncfg80211              178818  2 b43,mac80211\n\nI suspect that I did not blacklist the correct driver and there are two drivers causing instability, however I have no idea if I actually did it correctly. \n\nA: There are several reasons for that, possible causes:\n\n\n*\n\n*your disk have hardware failure, like I/O errors...\n\n*You have multiple firewalls enabled, and it is better to have only one, maybe \"gufw\" is the best... and it needs to deny all with rules to allow out udp 53 and allow out tcp 25,53,80,110,143,843,993,5060,8080\n\n*Your OS is not with all modules inserted, type: lsmod > list1.txt\nThen create an USB installer with the \"startup disk creator\" using the ISO of your installation CD (a pen of 2 GB is enough) then boot from that USB PEN and choose \"try Ubuntu\" and type there: lsmod > list2.txt and copy this file to the same location the one above and open  both in text editor and see if there is missing modules in list1.txt...\nTo install missing modules use first modinfo <name of the module> after the description see if it needs dependencies and install those first if not, just copy the full path of the ko file and type sudo insmod /path/to/file.ko\", after all modules inserted no need for reboot things should start working fine...\n\n*If you do not use proprietary driver, then might solve the problem due to the fact that the CPU is having trouble to process all the system in realtime, and that lack of CPU speed and Bridge speed causes wi-fi to disconnect, so try to install proprietary driver for your wireless card or disconnect every USB device that is not needed by your system to connect to the internet. If you do not find how to do this, go to \"software center\" and search \"additional drivers\" and if not installed, install it, then start it and activate all drivers available cause it will speed hings up and using less CPU...\n\n*This one is certainly your case, you are booting from an USB disk and using very fast speed which causes system resources to collapse, and has to shutdown one, and because the USB disk is the boot disk it chooses to disconnect the Wi-Fi! Solution is to connect the USB disk to an hub of less speed, like if was connected to USB3, use an USB2 hub which causes the USB disk to work at USB2 speed, if it was using USB2 then use an USB1.1 hub...\n\n*This is a long shot, and at far, your browser internet agent got corrupt or hacked by some intermediary that poses for an \"authority\" of contents provided by you, but this is a false authority, and just a cyberbulling occurence, cause there is no internet content that violates internet rules set by the internet authorities, and besides that you or anyone do not have nothing to do with the contents received, because everyone just enters the URL and the server decides which content to send, like, if two guys access the same URL at the same time, they get different pages content cause the server sends data according to lots of parameters and is configured to apply local country rules, like nudity can be considered ilegal in one country and not in other country. There is also the copyright issue but this also is not possible to violate, cause the copyright is not the act of making copies but the act of posing to be the author, that said, if one uploads copyrighted material without trying to own the copyright does not violate any internacional copyright rule. This two are the most common accusations by false \"authorities\" which makes your agent set your browser ID has an internet criminal act origin, causing every server in the world to disconnect that browser has soon it processes the browser agent, which sometimes takes several minutes... \n", "Q: How to use OSS instead of PulseAudio?

Something is causing suspend crash occasionally. When it does crash, the system freezes with a black screen and stays on, not suspending. This makes me have to hold the power button until the system shuts down. \nOne setting difference I have from most people is, I don't use the option that lets you suspend when the laptop lid is closed. So opening and closing the laptop lid has no actions. I like to press suspend manually.  Could this preference change be the cause? \nHow can I start looking for what's causing the crash, since the crash doesn't display errors? \n\nA: No, disabling the \"suspend on lid close\" function cannot affect manual suspend. \nYou would start by looking at the output of dmesg and the contents of /var/log/kern.log and /var/log/syslog for clues. \nWe can try to help if you share these with us. See this question for how:\n\nHow can I easily share the output of a command or a text file with others?\n\n\nA: I don't think the setting you mention is related.\nTrouble-shooting\nError messages relating to suspending are typically found in  /var/log/pm-suspend.log so have a look there.\nTypical cause\nThese problems are usually due to some process(es) stopping the system from being suspended.\nDo\ndmesg -T|grep Freez -A4\n\nand look for these entries:\n--\n[sun mar  3 15:19:48 2013] Freezing user space processes ... \n[sun mar  3 15:20:08 2013] Freezing of tasks failed after 20.01 seconds (3 tasks refusing to freeze, wq_busy=0):\n[sun mar  3 15:20:08 2013] mount.nfs       D e8631aa0     0  5518   5517 0x00800004\n[sun mar  3 15:20:08 2013]  e8631b10 00000086 f7bc0e00 e8631aa0 c1053cb4 c1809020 c192ee00 c192ee00\n--\n\nCheck the time stamps to see which of the reported problems relate to your try to suspend. In this case, it is mount.nfs that is causing the problems.\nSuggested workaround\nHave a script run automatically before suspending and have the script kill the offending process:\nThe user can provide scripts in the /etc/pm/sleep.d/ directory. Those scripts will be run by the system at suspend and resume. The file name should start with an ordering number. 00-49 is used for user scripts. For details, see man pm-suspend.\nThe script could look like this:\n#!/bin/sh\n(killall -9 mount.nfs; exit 0)\n\n...with correpsonding entries for other processes that caused problems, if any.\nParenthesis and exit 0 is a trick: if the process isn't found, killall will exit with en error exit code which will cancel the entire suspend. The parenthesis will make killall run in a sub-shell which will exit with exit code 0, regardless of the killall exit code.\nIf you're having problems, check /var/log/pm-suspend.log since it will also log problems relating to running the scripts in /etc/pm/sleep.d/.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 - Workspace switcher is shown after switching to another workspace I've just upgraded to Ubuntu 12.04 on HP Envy 14 and found a rather interesting bug.

Ubuntu One for Music source code on launchpad contains libGoogleAnalytics.jar which is proprietary. The license declares Gnu Affero Gpl license. Is this legal and why is it done?\n\nA: Well, to cover your licensing query, anyone who contributes code to Ubuntu One, and several other Canonical projects, must sign a contribution agreement which contains the following clause:\n\nBased on the grant of rights in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, if We include\n  Your Contribution in a Material, We may license the Contribution under\n  any license, including copyleft, permissive, commercial, or\n  proprietary licenses. As a condition on the exercise of this right, We\n  agree to also license the Contribution under the terms of the license\n  or licenses which We are using for the Material on the Submission\n  Date.\n\nThis means Canonical can release it simultaneously under as many different licences as they like, as long as one of them is the license the code was initially contributed under. So the source code on Launchpad might be AGPL, but the binary on Android Market isn't necessarily. So this situation is exactly why the contribution agreement exists.\nNote that the libGoogleAnalytics.jar has just been removed from the launchpad source, see this bug report.\n", "Q: Problem with theming my application with CSS I'm trying to beautify my program made with Quickly using CSS.

Any help much appreciated.\n---------------------EDIT--------------------\nI found a way to change GtkEntry and GtkButton background colours. Instead of using:\nGtkEntry, GtkButton {\n    background-color: #ffffff;\n}\n\nI've used:\nGtkEntry, GtkButton {\n    background: #ffffff;\n}\n\n\nA: Load your .css file using that tutorial code\nThen on your widget do :\n    self.sample_widget.get_style_context().add_class(\"sample_class\")\nPut this in the .css file :\nGtkButton.sample_widget \n{\n    color : #00FF00\n}\n\nA: You can get more specfic with \nGtkButton.name_of_button {\n       background: red;\n       }\n\n,that way only button widget \"name_of_button\" will be effected.\n\nA: Does \nGtkButton#nameofmywidget {\n    font: Ubuntu 12;\n}\n\nwork?\nHowevere. please post your widget code too.\n", "Q: What app tests all of GTK's UI elements? I've seen it in screenshots before. What application provides a window that contains all of GTK's UI elements? I need an answer applicable to GTK+2 and GTK+3.\n\nA: \"The widget factory\" doesn't support Gtk3. For that you can use \"A widget factory\":\nhttps://github.com/valr/awf\nYou can install it from the developer's PPA by typing in a terminal:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:valere-monseur/version\n\nsudo apt-get update && apt-get install awf\n\nDepending on your platform, replace version with either oneiric, precise or quantal.\n\nA: For GTK+3 you have the official gtk3-widget-factory in package gtk-3-examples.\n\nA: I think you're looking for \"The widget factory\". It can be installed from the standard repositories, afaik.\n", "Q: Free RAM disappears - Memory leak? On a fresh started system, free reports about 1.5G used RAM (8G RAM alltogether, Ubuntu 12.04 with lightdm and plasma desktop, one konsole window started). Having the apps running I use, it still consumes not more than 2G. However, having the system running for a couple of days, more and more of my free RAM disappears -- without showing up in the list of used apps: while smem --pie=name reports less than 20% used (and 80% being available), everything else says differently. free -m for example reports on about day 7:\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          7459       7013        446          0        178        997\n-/+ buffers/cache:       5836       1623\nSwap:         9536        296       9240\n\n(so you can see, it's not the buffers or the cache). Today this finally ended with the system crashing completely: the windows manager being gone, apps \"hanging in the air\" (frameless) -- and a popup notifying me about \"too many open files\". Syslog reports:\nkernel: [856738.020829] VFS: file-max limit 752838 reached\n\nSo I closed those applications I was able to close, and killed X using Ctrl-Alt-backspace. X tried to come up again after that with failsafeX, but was unable to do so as it could no longer detect its configuration. So I switched to a console using Ctrl-Alt-F2, captured all information I could think of (vmstat, free, smem, proc/meminfo, lsof, ps aux), and finally rebooted. X again came up with failsafeX; this time I told it to \"recover from my backed-up configuration\", then switched to a console and successfully used startx to bring up the graphical environment.\nI have no real clue to what is causing this issue -- though it must have to do either with X itself, or with some user processes running on X -- as after killing X, free -m output looked like this:\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          7459       2677       4781          0         62        419\n-/+ buffers/cache:       2195       5263\nSwap:         9536         59       9477\n\n(~3.5GB being freed) -- to compare with the output after a fresh start:\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          7459       1483       5975          0         63        730\n-/+ buffers/cache:        689       6769\nSwap:         9536          0       9536\n\nTwo more helpful outputs are provided by memstat -u.

Interesting to see: everytime when there's a \"jump\" in memory consumption, CPU peaks as well. Just found this right now -- and it reminds me of another indicator pointing to X itself: Often when returning to my machine and unlocking the screen, I found something doing heavvy work on my CPU. Checking with top, it always turned out to be /usr/bin/X :0 -auth /var/run/lightdm/root/:0 -nolisten tcp vt7 -novtswitch -background none.\nSo after this long explanation, finally my questions:\n\n\n*\n\n*What could be the possible causes?\n\n*How can I better identify involved processes/applications?\n\n*What steps could be taken to avoid this behaviour -- short from rebooting the machine all X days?\n\n\nI was running 8.04 (Hardy) for about 5 years on my old machine, never having experienced the like (always more than 100 days uptime, before rebooting for e.g. kernel updates). This now is a complete new machine with a fresh install of 12.04. In case it matters, some specs:\nAMD A4-3400 APU with Radeon(tm) HD Graphics, using the open-source ati/radeon driver (so no fglrx installed), 8GB RAM, WDC WD1002FAEX-0 hdd (1TB), Asus F1A75-V Evo mainboard. Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit with KDE4/Plasma. Apps usually open more or less permanently include Evolution, Firefox, konsole (with Midnight Commander running inside, about 4 tabs), and LibreOffice -- plus occasionally Calibre, Gimp and Moneyplex (banking software I'm already using for almost 20 years now, in a version which did fine on Hardy).\nEdit:\nToday I found one of the \"evil guys\": KDE4s plasma-desktop. Used memory was again up to 5GB, when I did a killall plasma-desktop && plasma-desktop. This freed up 1.3GB RAM! ps says:\n                             RSS    SIZE   VSZ\nplasma usage before restart  120988 526472 1300816\nplasma usage after restart   92352  495972 1263632\n\nSo where have those 1.3GB been? The diff between those values, if added up, amount to 96MB -- not 1.3GB.\nAnd this can only be one part, as still 3.7GB are in use (should be less than 2GB). I monitored this during the past 6 days using several tools: used memory (not talking about cache and buffers) increases slowly but steadily. Even if I'm not at my desk to run anything...\nAs to monitoring processes with open files, I currently use the following 1-liner (I love shell and especially bash) to get the top-5:\necho \"$(for pid in $(ls -a /proc|egrep '^([0-9])*$'|sort -n 2>/dev/null); do \\\nif [ -e /proc/$pid/fd ]; then FHC=$(ls -l /proc/$pid/fd|wc -l); \\\nif [ $FHC -gt 0 ]; then PNAME=\"$(cat /proc/$pid/comm)\"; \\\necho \"$FHC files opened by $pid ($PNAME)\"; fi; fi; done)\"|sort -r -n|head -n5\n\nCommand here in 4 lines for better readability. Nothing much yet from there -- except that Skype doesn't like have the Internet connection broken. Each disconnect causes a slight increase of its open files, but nothing dramatic. On the other hand it seems like plasma is also responsible for that:\n\nSee the drop of file handles at the end? That was the plasma restart.\n\nA: *\n\n*The huge number of open files is a good clue that something is going wrong. My guess would be some KDE system daemon.\n\n*Open a console and run \"top\". Then use < and > to change the sorting column to VIRT or RES and see which programs are using the most memory. A memory leak will show up as a massively inflated virtual memory use, as once the pointer to the leaked memory is lost it won't be used and will be swapped out. Also run \"lsof\" and look for a process with lots of open files, since this seems to really be a file descriptor leak.\n\n*Track down the program and report a bug.\n\nA: I think thats normal system behaivor. Most likely everything is fine. \nYou may read this brilliant paper (linux ate my ram) to understand, how linux is managing your ram and why there is no need to worry:\nhttp://www.linuxatemyram.com/\n", "Q: Why does apt-get keep waiting for headers on Oracle repository?

Will it be in 12.04 at all, or will I have to wait until 12.10?\n\nA: *\n\n*The latest python-matplotlib official release from the developers is 1.1.1-rc2\n\n*So you will not see python-matplotlib 1.2 in 12.04 official repositories anytime soon.\n\n*Consider that the current version of python-matplotlib in Debian Sid is also 1.1.1-rc2\n\n*Ubuntu 12.10, currently in alpha, also contains 1.1.1-rc2\n\n*This is expected, since it's based on the packages in Debian Sid; 12.10 will be \"frozen\" on August 23, 2012, and any package updates after that date will be rare (only critical stability fixes, etc.)\n\n*So bottom line, unless python-matplotlib 1.2 makes it into Debian Sid before August 23, you may not see it upon 12.10 release either (although it may make it into updates)\n\n\nA: so, I'm running Ubuntu 12.04, \nand this seems to have worked for me.. while not directly from the repo, but does play nice without complexity of 'virtualenvironment' stuffs..\n\"Getting matplotlib running with python3\"\nsudo apt-get build-dep python-matplotlib \nsudo apt-get install python3-dev\nwget https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/zipball/master\nunzip master\ncd matplotlib-matplotlib-bb3ea55 <=== the directory name will vary with version\nsudo python3 setup.py build\nsudo python3 setup.py install\nsudo apt-get install python3-pyqt4\n\nthanks to 'Mike', as copied here from:  https://gist.github.com/mlongval/4950532 \n", "Q: How to install Mozilla Firefox on kubuntu 12.04? I have installed Kubuntu 12.04 on my netbook. Each time I invoke the Firefox Installer, it downloads a package, and nothing happens.\nThanks for help in advance.\n\nA: If you want to install software graphically in Kubuntu you need to use an application called Muon. You can also install packages from the command line by opening a terminal and typing, for the example related to your question, sudo apt-get install firefox. sudo tells the computer you want to do the following action with administrative privileges, apt-get is an application to install software and firefox is the name of the package you want to install. The terminal will ask for your password and, once you give it, apt-get will do the rest.\n\nA: When you said \"invoking the Firefox installer\", do you mean downloading it on their website?\nIf it is the case, Firefox is into the package you downloaded. Unpack the package (with the archive manager, for example) and you will find a folder called \"firefox\" containing the program.\n", "Q: How do I get Terminator to start up with my custom layout? Terminator is very powerful at organizing several computers or servers due to the split window and group all function. But here's the deal: I created my own Layout and would appreciate it to load at startup of terminator. Is that possible?\n\nA: After setting up your layout, right-click on any terminal background and choose Preferences → Layouts tab and click on Add button. When prompted for the name type \"default\" and hit Enter.\nNote: This may be a glitch but it's a useful glitch for me!\n\nA: To open a previously saved layout, open the Terminator Layout Launcher by pressing ALT-L. There, click on the layout you need, and press launch.\n\nA: It's very simple. No need to edit the configuration file. \nJust create your custom layout and Right Click->Preference->Layout->default and Press the save button. Now our configuration is saved as the default configuration. From next launch of the terminator, we will get the custom layout at the startup itself.\n\nA: Just as an anecdote, even after configuring custom layout 're-use profile for newer terminals' has to be checked otherwise the new terminal again opens in default profile.\n\n\nA: There is a very easy way to accomplish this:\n\n\n*\n\n*Open Terminator\n\n*Right click -> Preferences\n\n*In the Layouts tab (to the right of the Profiles tab), edit the default one, you will see that it says Window | window0 and Terminal | child1.\n\n*For the Terminal | child1, you can set: a Profile (to choose from the installed ones), a Default command, and a Working directory.\n\n*Set it/them to whatever you like, close, reopen again...\n\n*... and voilá!\n\n\nHope this helped!\n\nA: After saving your layout (as per mhnagaoka's answer), you can make your changes used by default by editing the config file.\nEdit the ~/.config/terminator/config file and look for where it says [layouts]. It should look something like this:\n[layouts]\n  [[default]]\n    # ..default layout\n  [[yourLayout]]\n    # ..your custom layout\n\nRename [[yourLayout]] to [[default]] and remove/rename the previous default layout. Now, when Terminator starts without any parameters, it will load your custom default layout!\n\nA: *\n\n*After setting up your layout, right-click on any terminal background and choose Preferences → Layouts tab and click on Add button.\n\n\n*Give it a name and hit Close.\n\n\n*This should create the mentioned ~/.config/terminator/config file.\n\n\n*Now you can start terminator using the saved layout using: terminator -l yourLayout (replace yourLayout with whatever you chose on step 2).\n\n\n*(optional) Edit the ~/.config/terminator/config file so that where it says [layouts] and nested below it [[yourLayout]], rename yourLayout to default and remove/rename the previous default layout. Now, when Terminator starts without any parameters, it will load your custom [[default]] layout!\n\n\n*(optional) Edit the [[[terminalx]]]/ command = a custom command;bash eg: command = ssh user@IP;bash (ending with bash) for each terminal, so that it will run your custom command during startup!!\n\nA: I use the method mhnagaoka suggested, but I made it usable from the launcher in Unity.\nI also had an issue with plain terminator -l my_default command, \nso specify these additional flags \n\n\n*\n\n*-b for borderless and \n\n*-m for maximized.\n\n\nThe final Command is terminator -m -b -l my_default.\nNow you need to modify terminator.desktop entry for Unity.\nGo to your application folder, in my case it was /usr/share/applications.\nYou need to have root permissions to edit with your text editor terminator.desktop.\nIn my case it was, sudo vim terminator.desktop.\nReplace the Exec argument with your Command.\nNow you can add the entry to your Unity Launcher, and it should always open your custom layout on the start.\n", "Q: Why can't I install Windows 8 in Virtualbox on 12.04? \nNote: This appears to be a problem with Windows 8, no matter what host OS Virtualbox is running on.\n\nI recently tried to install Windows 8 RP 32-bit in Virtualbox using Ubuntu 12.04 as the host.

I was AFK for about 24 hours and came back to find gnome-system-monitor saying all four CPU cores on my laptop were running at full throttle. mysqld is taking up more than one full core; when I tried to end the process, it restarted with a new PID. Then there's ksoftirqd/0-3, which apparently has something to do with interrupts, but I can't tell from Google what I'm supposed to do with those four particular processes. They're taking up a quarter or more of my processor cycles. Then there's Chrome, but I can probably handle that on my own -- how do I cool down the other processes giving me problems?\n\nA: There is a bug in the kernel that causes a failure because of the \"leap second\" that happened on June 30.\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1020285\n\nA: Here is a description of the problem and the fix: http://blog.mozilla.org/it/2012/06/30/mysql-and-the-leap-second-high-cpu-and-the-fix/\nTo solve the problem, run\ndate -s \"`date`\" && touch /tmp/leapsecond_2012_06_30\n\n(Those are backticks inside double-quotes.

The kernel could account for some of that memory, but not up to a few GB, could it ?\n\nA: Check the output of free -m. It will look similar to this:\n             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached\nMem:          7459       1483       5975          0         63        730\n-/+ buffers/cache:        689       6769\nSwap:         9536          0       9536\n\nWith different numbers probably. The first line (\"Mem:\") gives you the overall consumption, including cache and buffers (to speed up things, Linux uses free RAM to cache things like e.g. file system info -- see the \"cache\" column in my example. If the RAM occupied by this cache is needed elsewhere, that cache will shrink to free it). So look at the second line (\"-/+ buffers/cache:\"), which gives you the amount of memory really used by applications (plus kernel etc. of course). This should usually rawly match your calculation.\n", "Q: Firefox consuming wildly inordinate amount of CPU I've got a Firefox process with nothing in it but the Google home page (the \"search\" page, not the \"homey\" home page with news etc.) and this site.  I've killed it and restarted it multiple times. It's burning massive amounts of CPU cycles doing ... what?\nI notice that Firefox, over time, leaks memory terribly and uses more and more CPU, but not anything close to this much. What is it doing? At present it's the primary process loading down the system, and that's new behavior. Eating memory and getting bloated is usually something that makes it sluggish. Now it's just hogging resources and spinning my fan.\nI'm running 12.04 on an HP laptop but that shouldn't matter of course.\nAre there some Firefox tools for looking at its internal thread activity or something?\nedit newly-created profiles show exactly the same behavior ...\n\nA: This LKML thread describes a kernel issue that appeared due to the 2012 leap second insertion (1 Jul 2012). I don't know exactly what they're talking about, but it seems that the clock update didn't do some internal bookkeeping, with the result being that some synchronization calls weren't resulting in the ordinary process blocking that they'd cause. Thus, some user-mode processes that rely on the kernel service were just spinning the CPU endlessly.\nThe fix, however, is extremely simple:\nsudo date -s \"`date`\"\n\nImmediately after doing that — and I did nothing else — the Firefox process calmed down. I could see the sharp \"cliff\" on my CPU monitor.\n", "Q: Why does Unity screen blank out over XDMCP? My XDMCP sessions display fine until I login.

I found Google Chrome running as service after I installed it, at each reboot.\nThis would not be a problem, if it won't eath 100% cpu. I would not like to uninstall it, but I'll be forced to do that if I can't find a way to disable its remain in memory as a service.\nI couldn't find anything in Boot-Up-Manager, so I'm asking where to search...\n\nA: Do you have \"Continue running background apps when Google Chrome is closed\" ticked? If so, try unticking the box and then remove Google Chrome from the Startup Menu.\nAlso check to see if you have any sort of \"notifications\" such as GMail or messaging that may be causing the browser to be \"always on\".\n\n\nA: I had cloud print enabled which caused it.  Try disconnecting any cloud print printers you may be sharing from this computer.  In vasa1's pic, if you're sharing any printers, under Google Cloud Print, instead of 'Add Printers' there will be a button for disconnecting printers.  Hit that and then also make sure you have background apps unchecked (off).\n\nA: Type this command s in terminal\ncd /etc/xdg/autostart/\n\nsudo sed --in-place 's/NoDisplay=true/NoDisplay=false/g' *.desktop\n\nAnd do a reboot , click the top Right-Corner Settings icon , to select Startup Applications.\n \nIf Google Chrome is present in list there , just Unselect to stop Autostarting it.\n\nA: You do not need to go to terminal to do this. There is an app called Startup Applications, which you can find by pressing the 9 dots in the corner and typing \"Startup\". Then, if Google Chrome is selected, unselect it and click \"remove\". That's all! It should stop opening chrome every time you log in. ;D\n", "Q: Can I recover a deleted partition table faster if I remember some of the layout? I accidentally deleted the partition table of a 1.5TB drive with about 10 partitions on it; I'm running testdisk now but it's going to take a while to scan everything.\nI do have some useful information which I'm hoping can speed things up - the partition layout and filesystem types (mostly NTFS, some FAT32, EXT3/4). Unfortunately there are a few unknowns with the partition sizes. I do have another disk with a backup of (most) of the partitions, but there may still be some unknowns.\nIs there any way to use the information I do have to speed up the partition table recovery, or do I just need to wait for the exhaustive scan to finish?\n\nA: No - not recommended, can cause irretrievable data loss\nUnless you have all the information fdisk -l provides, you shouldn't attempt this. Just knowing the filesystems isn't going to help much (yet); the start and end are what matter most.\nLet testdisk run and take its own time -- it usually does a very good job.\n", "Q: Google-talkplugin not working in Ubuntu 12.04 64bit Google-talkplugin is not working for me on Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise) 64-bit, I have reinstalled the system many times to get it to work but still it doesn't.\nThe problem is not with AppArmor as I have checked it with strace firefox.\nAnyone else has it? Do you have any ideas & workarounds? What can I do to help fix it as I couldn't find a Google bug tracker for the plugin?\n\nA: It works for me in Chrome but I had to enable all plugins: Settings->Privacy->Content Settings->Plugins->Run Automatically. I set this when I want to make a call, then set to to \"Click To Play\" when browsing the web.\nI have not tried Firefox so I can't help you there.\n\nA: This used to work in Chromium, but I was never able to get it to work in Chromium after I upgraded to 12.10.

See with the following command if any of these modules is already loaded:\npactl list short modules\n\nIf not, then test if you can make automatic switching work by issuing one or both of the following commmands in a terminal:\npactl load-module module-switch-on-connect\npactl load-module module-switch-on-port-available\n\nOn success add one or both of the following lines to your /etc/pulse/default.pa\nload-module module-switch-on-connect\nload-module module-switch-on-port-available\n\nThis will then always load these modules on every login, resp. restart of the pulseaudio daemon.\nPlease note that local user settings in ~/.config/pulse/default.pa override system-wide setting.

Is there a pomodoro app that's available for Ubuntu 12.04 that can be installed using sudo or from the package manager?\n\nA: It's not exactly an app, but I've posted an answer to a similar question on Super User That basically revolved around using the terminal to program your Pomodoros.\nYou'd be basically issuing the following terminal command to start a Pomodoro:\nsleep 1500 && notify-send -u critical \"break\"\n\nIn order to introduce breaks, you'd be running the following:\nsleep 300 && notify-send -u critical \"back to work\"  # a short, 5-minute break\nsleep 900 && notify-send -u critical \"back to work\"  # a long, 15-minute break\n\nThat's the gist of it.

What should be the correct way to exit the file explorer in vim?\n\nA: :q should work just as fine with the \"file explorer\" as with any other open buffers. A segmentation fault suggests there's a serious bug in the version of vim you are using (or it could be a kernel bug or faulty RAM). \nI tried this myself, but did not get a segmentation fault.\n\nA: I open the file explorer in the same buffer as the file by default using vim-vinegar.\nI've managed to map Esc to delete the file explorer buffer and return me to the file I was editing, by putting this in .vimrc:\nautocmd FileType netrw nmap <silent> <buffer> <Esc> :BD<cr>\n\n:BD is a command supplied by the BufKill.vim plugin.

The only way I've been able to use the scanner is to scan to a memory card and then stick the sd card into my pc.\nThere are some untested drivers here but I got an error message when installing. \n\nA: I may have a workaround that is relevant to you. I have a Kodak ESP 9250, and I was able to get it running as a printer under 11.04 (since upgraded to 12.04). I had the same error as you did when I tried to scan directly to the \"USB Connected Computer\" option.\nHowever, I decided to try scanning to a USB drive plugged into the front of the printer - that worked, and since I had the printer hooked up to my laptop, and the cable was still connected, the USB drive was simultaneously mounted on my laptop!\nSo if you do a scan to \"USB Flash drive\", the drive is mounted under /media, and your files are in  /media/(flashdrive ID)/DCIM/(printer ID)/.\nThis is not much better than just scanning to the flash drive directly and moving it, but hopefully this helps.\n", "Q: Invalid system disc on boot When I boot my laptop which has ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7 I get a message \n   \"Invalid system disc\n    Please replace the disc,then press any key\"\nIf on this command I press random keys my grub menu appears and my booting to ubuntu\n12.04 takes place without any glitch. Also I initially installed 11.10 but upgraded to\n12.04 when it was released. Also, no such problem ever occured when I was on 11.10.\n\nA: Please open BIOS and see the boot priority. \nIn boot priority you have selected  a device that is not present in your system.

Its native format is DWG v2010.\nIf you're willing to pay Bricscad is a lot more powerful, has ACIS modeling just like AutoCAD (Pro version) and its Platinum version has even parametric modeling. All that for a fraction of the price of an AutoCAD license.\nBut in any case, I'm not sure AutoCAD is suitable for aeronautical engineering...\n\nA: LibreCad is good I use it myself but to be honest you will struggle to find one as good as AutoCad.

As the design spec states, \"Other than that hover effect, bubbles should not directly respond to input devices in any way.\" The it also asserts that when actions are requested, it will fallback to an alert box:\n\nFor cases where applications have expected the notification system to\n  allow interactivity without checking whether it actually does, and\n  cases where applications have expected the notification system to\n  display a notification indefinitely, Notify OSD should show an alert\n  box as a fallback.\n\nWhile it's up for debate whether or not that is a good decision,\nNotify-osd is an implementation of the Freedesktop notification spec,\nwhich clearly states that it is the responsiblity of the client\nto make sure the server supports the desired ability:\n\nClients should try and avoid making assumptions about the presentation\n  and abilities of the notification server. The message content is the\n  most important thing.\nClients can check with the server what capabilities are supported\n  using the GetCapabilities message.\n\nYou can test for notification server capabilities with something like:\nimport pynotify\n\npynotify.init(\"Test Capabilities\")\ncaps = pynotify.get_server_caps()\n\nif caps and 'actions' in caps:\n    # We support actions, so add a button.\n    notification = pynotify.Notification(\"Can we use actions?\", \\\n                                         \"Yup, we sure do.\")\n    notification.add_action(\"ignore\", \"Ignore\", ignore_cb)\nelse:\n    notification = pynotify.Notification(\"Can we use actions?\", \\\n                                         \"Nope, we don't support actions.\")\nnotification.show()\n\n", "Q: Why is the superblock last mount time in the future?

I read somewhere that etc/fstab doesn't apply to removable media, which are mounted by gnome-volume-manager and therefore cannot be unmounted by a user. How should I proceed in attempting to resolve this issue? Thanks\n\nA: You could try this. Though, Ubuntu should be doing this automatically, provided your drives are healthy.\nPlug your drive in. \nUse fdisk -l to find the name of the external drive. (ie. /dev/sdb)\nUnmount the the drive sudo umount /dev/YOUR_DRIVE_HERE\nCreate mount point sudo mkdir /mnt/MOUNT_POINT\nMount the drive: mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/YOUR_DRIVE_NAME /mnt/MOUNT_POINT\nMore info here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountingWindowsPartitions#NTFS\n\nA: You can install ntfs-config which is included in the official repositories.

Also, please help me to correct this problem I'm facing (alternatively, I will migrate to the old and good tray icon (it works fine in 12.04, anyway) which I can handle very easily and efficiently)\n\nA: You shouldn't use libappindicator for creating an Application Indicator in Qt programs.

I'd like to create a shortcut with Ctrl+Backspace or Fn+Backspace or Ctrl+Shift+Backspace which performs a forward delete (the same as the Delete key). I use it (Fn+Backspace) on a Mac and I find it very useful.\nIs this feasible?\n\nA: I don't think this is possible. I tried to do it with xmodmap, but, apparently, it can't catch Fn, so I tried it with the Ctrl and Ctrl+Shift options.\nYou can see the current behavior of BackSpace using:\nxmodmap -pke | grep BackSpace\n\nand the output it gives is:\nkeycode  22 = BackSpace BackSpace BackSpace BackSpace\n\nThe different values correspond to the different modifiers:\n1st: no modifier\n2nd: shift\n3rd: ctrl\n4th: ctrl-shift\n\nSo we would like to change either the 3rd or the 4th value. We can do this by executing:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode  22 = BackSpace BackSpace Delete BackSpace\"\n\nor:\nxmodmap -e \"keycode  22 = BackSpace BackSpace BackSpace Delete\"\n\nrespectively, but unfortunately this does not work for me. I think these values are overridden on some deeper level and both Ctrl+Backspace and Ctrl+Shift+Backspace still deletes a word backwards.\nSo I think you're stuck just using the Delete key...\n\nA: Very very old question, but just for reference:\n\n*\n\n*in later Linux/Ubuntu/Kubuntu: Fn+Backspace works as delete just like on OSX\n\nIn case Fn+Backspace is not working or is not convenient (Fn can be  bottom left, backspace top right and two hands are needed) etc:\n\n\n*some applications, like in Plasma, have their own editable shortcuts to delete next character (Kate text editor) or to delete files (Dolphin file manager):\n\n\n\n\n\n*There is also the affordable solution to Turn Caps Lock key into delete key (as uppercase can be triggered pressing Shift)\n\n\n*in order to create another shortcut for Delete (like Super+Backspace or Shift+Backspace), see this answer (but don't use it simultaneously with settings like at point 2 above!); also, this doesn't seem to work as expected: see this: Remapped Shift+Backspace to Delete works only for some applications, so maybe point 3 is preferable\n", "Q: Installer crash when i tried to install 12.04 on my macbook Pro 7.1 I tried to install Ubuntu 12.04 several times on my macbookpro 7.1 but each times it crashed.\nI burned a liveCD - desktop 64bits, and launched it.

When I boot into the live CD, I can see sda. I can partition it with fdisk. But when I start the installer and it gets to the partitioning window, the \"Device for boot loader installation\" drop down box has only the usb disk (sdb) in it -- not sda. So I can not choose a place to install ubuntu.\nWhat could cause that?\nI am building two similar machines. The other one did not have this problem. The only difference is that they have different hard disks.\nUpdate: originally, the drive had a centos install. I ran fdisk only after the installer did not recognize it. I just ran garted and this time I had it recreate the partition table and now the installer sees the drive.\n\nA: It sounds like sdb is the hard drive in this instance. sda is just the first drive it sees, which in this system sounds like the USB stick is detected as a hard drive. Boot the live USB into Try mode, then fire up \"Disk Utility\" and it will list both disks, see which one the hard drive is. I'd bet it's sdb.

I have a lot of files on here i wish to put on a flash drive but it won't recognize it.\n\nA: Sounds as if you changed the ownership and / or permissions of system files.\nYou can search ~/.bash_history for the commands you ran, and if you post them here perhaps they are easily reversed.\ngedit ~/.bash_history\n\nLook for commands such as chown or chmod , if they were run with the -R (recursive) option, easier to re-install. If, however, you changed only a few files or directories, recovery is possible.\nOften though you will have to re-install as manually fixing permissions is time consuming and imperfect.\nIn the future see: ubuntu sudo page\nNormally you use sudo or for graphical applications gksu to perform system administration or edit system files.\nExample:\ngksu gedit /path/to/file\nsudo command\n\n\nA: Sounds like you hosed your system by changing permissions and/or ownership of important system files. Depending on what exactly you did, fixing the system could be easy or hard. \nGiven that you're not sure what exactly you did that caused this, I'd say a reinstall is probably the easiest option. It is quite likely possible to undo what you did and get your system back to normal, but a reinstallation may take less time to get a working system back. \nNothing you've mentioned so far suggests that your personal files have been removed/compromised, so you should be able to extract your files from your harddrive by booting an Ubuntu Desktop CD/USB, mounting your partition(s) and copying the important files to another media, like a USB stick/harddrive or network share.\n\nA: We don't necessarily know everything that's wrong with your system, but we do know one thing that's wrong:\nsudo: must be setuid root\n\nsudo is the primary mechanism used to perform administrative tasks in an Ubuntu system. Its ownership and/or permissions are broken, so it cannot work.\nFortunately, on a desktop Ubuntu system, there is another mechanism used to perform administrative tasks: PolicyKit. So you can usually fix a broken sudo using the pkexec command-line frontend to PolicyKit, without even having to boot into recovery mode or from a live CD/DVD/USB. sudo having the wrong ownership/permissions is not the most common breakage scenario, but it's fixed just as easily. Just open a Terminal window (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run these commands:\npkexec chown root:root /usr/bin/sudo\npkexec chmod 4755 /usr/bin/sudo\n\nRunning those commands should fix the permissions on sudo.\nThat might or might not fix the basic problem. You can see if sudo works now by running a harmless command like sudo ls. You should update your question and/or comment here to provide information about what errors you see next, if any.\nOnce you regain full access to your system you should do one of two things:\n\n\n*\n\n*Look at your .bash_history to figure out what commands you ran, then update your question so that we can tell you how to undo any other damage that was done. Your system may still be in an insecure or unstable state, even if things seem to be working all right.\n\n*Or, do a fresh reinstallation of Ubuntu, if you're not able to do that.\nFinally, please note:\n\n\n*\n\n*In a situation where you are actually not an administrator on your own computer, that can be fixed quite easily. Fixing it does not involve changing the permissions on any files. Changing the permissions on files does not fix this.\n\n*If you an break your system the way it seems you have--that is, if you can change the ownership or permissions of /usr/bin/sudo--then you were definitely already an administrator on your system (unless you booted to recovery mode or from a live CD/DVD/USB to do it). Non-administrators cannot make such changes to an Ubuntu system.\n\n*Even when you are an administrator on your system, you may see \"access denied\" and similar messages when attempting to perform some tasks. This does not generally mean that you are unable to perform them, but rather that you are not using the right technique to perform them. In particular, administrator accounts are still limited--you must use something like sudo to perform most administrative actions.\n\nA: Looks like you lost you rights on the sudo file.\nReboot your computer, select Recovery console and do : \nchown root:root /usr/bin/sudo\n\nchmod 4755 /usr/bin/sudo\n\nthis should fix your sudo problem. \nA complete tuto about it : http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/fixsudo#recoverymode\n", "Q: How do I make the launcher progress bar work with my application? Background Research\nI am attempting to update the progress bar within the Unity launcher for a simple python/Gtk application created using Quickly called test; however, following the instructions in this video, I have not been able to successfully update the progress bar in the Unity launcher.\nIn the Unity Integration video, Quickly was not used, so the way that the application was structured was slightly different, and the code used in the video does not seem to function properly without modification in a default Quickly ubuntu-application template application.\n\nScreenshots\nHere is a screenshot of the application icon as it is currently displayed in the Unity Launcher.\n\nHere is a screenshot of the kind of Unity launcher progress bar functionality that I would like (overlayed on mail icon: wiki.ubuntu.com).\n\n\nProject Code\nA .zip file containing the project files can be found here.\n\nExpected Behavior\nI  would expect the above code to show a progress bar that is 75% full overlayed on the icon for the test application in the Unity Launcher, but the application only runs and displays no progress bar when the command quickly run is executed.\n\nProblem Investigation\nI believe that the problem is that I am not properly getting a reference to the application's main window, however, I am not sure how to properly fix this problem. I also believe that the line: self.launcher = Unity.LauncherEntry.get_for_desktop_id(\"test.destkop\") may be another source of complication because Quickly creates .desktop.in files rather than ordinary .desktop files, so I am not sure if that might be causing issues as well. \nPerhaps, another source of the issue is that I do not entirely understand the difference between .desktop and .desktop.in files. Does it possibly make sense to make a copy of the test.desktop.in file and rename it test.desktop, and place it in /usr/share/applications in order for get_for_desktop_id(\"test,desktop\") to reference the correct .desktop file?\n\nRelated Research Links\nAlthough, I am still not clear on the difference between .desktop and .desktop.in files, I have done some research on .desktop files and I have come across a couple of links:\n\n\n*\n\n*Desktop Entry Files (library.gnome.org) \n\n*Desktop File Installation Directory (askubuntu.com)\n\n*Unity Launcher API (wiki.ubuntu.com)\n\n*Desktop Files: putting your application in the desktop menus (developer.gnome.org)\n\n*Desktop Menu Specification (standards.freedesktop.org)\n\nEdit\nAfter running python setup.py build and then navigating to /build/share/applications and moving the built test.desktop file to ~/.local/share/applications, and finally executing quickly run, only a question mark for an icon is being displayed, with no visible progress bar.\n\n\nEdit 2\nAfter further investigation of the built .desktop file, it turns out that the line:\nIcon=/usr/share/test/media/test.svg within the .desktop file was pointing to an icon file called test.svg which did not exist. \nIn order to resolve this problem, I created a new folder called test in /usr/share/ using the command sudo mkdir test and then created another folder inside of the test folder called media using the command sudo mkdir media, and then I moved the test.svg icon file located in my Quickly project directory at test/data/media/test.svg to /usr/share/test/media/. The .svg icon for the application now displays properly in the Unity launcher bar and in the alt-tab view, however there is still no visible progress bar as shown in the screenshot below.\n\n\nEdit 3\nAs @dobey, pointed out, there was a typo in the code of the TestWindow.py file at the line: \nself.launcher = Unity.LauncherEntry.get_for_desktop_id(\"test.destkop\"), \nwhere test.destkop, should be test.desktop.\nI changed this typo and no visible changes occurred when the application was executed using quickly run. However, after adding the line print('Integrating with launcher') to add_launcher_integration() there was no corresponding output in the terminal when the application was run, indicating that the problem seems to be that add_launcher_integration() does not seem to be called correctly when the application starts.\n\nEdit 4\nAfter further investigation, it turns out that add_launcher_integration() is in fact called when the application starts. With the addition of the line:\nos.system(\"clear\")\n\nprior to the line\nprint(\"Integrating with launcher\")\n\nthe message \"Integrating with launcher\" now displays in the terminal.\nHowever, there is still no progress bar visisble in the Unity launcher bar.\n\nEdit 5\nAfter rebuilding the Quickly project by executing python setup.py build and moving the built .desktop file within the Quickly project located at /build/share/applications/ to ~/.local/share/applications, the application icon and the progress bar now displays properly in the Unity launcher bar. A screenshot of the launcher integration can be seen below.\n\n\nA: The .desktop file has to be installed in the location where the bamf library knows about it.\nYou should be able to test by copying the built .desktop file (which should be created from the .desktop.in), into your ~/.local/share/applications folder, and running update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications, though running this command may not be needed if your application does not handle any MIME types.\nThe difference between the .desktop and .desktop.in is that the .desktop.in is set up for being translated, and is processed by intltool during build, to have the translations inserted, creating the .desktop file from the .desktop.in file.\nAlso I just noticed a typo in your code:\nself.launcher = Unity.LauncherEntry.get_for_desktop_id(\"test.destkop\")\n\nNotice the \"destkop\" vs. \"desktop\" that it should be. Perhaps this is it, if it's not a re-typing error. Assuming your code is actually being run, this is a problem. If it isn't run, then that's the problem. You can add a print('Integrating with launcher') to the add_launcher_integration function to see. It should appear on the terminal when run.\n", "Q: Where do I find drivers for the Realtek 8111E LAN controller? I just bought an ASUS P8H61-M LX motherboard.

The current quad-core Llano offerings are clocked at 2.6GHz (A6-3650) and 2.9GHz (A8-3850), while this Trinity part is clocked slower, it's numbers are nice compared to my A8-3850 Linux system.\nIt appears that the graphics acceleration support for the Trinity Devastator is in place as of the fglrx 8.90 release stream. It's nice to see the Trinity APU working with Ubuntu 11.04, albeit on the proprietary driver. By the time Trinity is officially out, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS should be here and hopefully with mature support and perhaps some performance optimizations within the GCC compiler.\n\nSo yes it works.

I also know how to search the existing solutions before asking for help. I have scoured the Internet high and low and learned much of how Grub2 works. But nothing has helped me to solve my problem.\nMy problem is this: I have a computer that has three hard drives. It previously had Windows XP, but I upgraded to Windows 7. I also installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin). \nDuring my installation of Windows 7, there was a failure and I had to restart the installation. Afterwards, I installed Ubuntu. After some trouble removing all traces of the XP OS (Ubuntu auto-detected it,  but not Windows 7) I got the two OSes working flawlessly. Or, almost.\nWhen booting up, Grub2 used to display Ubuntu, Ubuntu Recovery Mode, Other Versions of Linux, memtest, followed by Windows 7 (loader) on /dev/sda1 and Windows 7 (loader) on /dev/sdb1.\nI eventually removed Recovery Mode, Other Versions, and Memtest. Now, when I run:\nsudo update-grub\n\nI get this print-out:\nGenerating grub.cfg ...\nFound linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.2.0-26-generic\nFound initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.2.0-26-generic\nFound Windows 7 (loader) on /dev/sda1\nFound Windows 7 (loader) on /dev/sdb1\n\nI would like to remove \"Windows 7 (loader) on /dev/sda1\", as it is a broken entry that shouldn't exist, and must have been installed during my first Windows 7 attempt.\nI cannot find a Windows 7 entry in /etc/grub.d folder And I don't know where to look.\nHere is a layout of my hard drives:\n/dev/sda1/ (1.82 TiB), NTFS (\"Media\")\n\n/dev/sdb1/ (100 Mib), NTFS (\"System Reserved\")\n/dev/sdb2/ (149 GiB), NTFS (\"Windows 7\")\n/dev/sdb3/ (149 GiB), Extended (\" \")\n    /dev/sdb4/ (145 GiB), ext4 (\" \")\n    /dev/sdb5/ (4 GiB), linux-swap (\" \")\n\n/dev/sdc1/ (488.28 GiB), NTFS (\"Downloads\")\n/dev/sdc2/ (488.28 GiB), NTFS (\"AltMedia\") \n/dev/sdc3/ (886.45 GiB), NTFS (\"Personal\")\nunallocated (2.09 MiB), unallocated\n\nWhat I think has happened: Windows 7 installed first and badly. I installed it again. First, there was Windows XP to guide where the bootloader went to so it was put on /dev/sdb1/. But, the second time no such guide existed so the machine put another bootloader on /dev/sda1/. sda1, by the way, is the only partition on a 2TB drive. No boot record partition appears to exist according to gedit. I'm not sure where Grub2 is getting this information from. But, there it is. \nIs there anything somebody can do to help me? Or, is there any more information I should add?\n\nA: A quick solution if sda is a external drive\nI don't know whether your /dev/sda hard drive is an internal or an external drive. If it is an external drive, Unplug the external drive before running update-grub2 command. This should help quickly.\nSolution:\nMount the /dev/sda1 drive. (I assume you can do that very easily). Then in that drive look for a folder named Boot and a file named bootmgr. Remove both the folder and file. Then run update-grub2 command again.\nYou might want to install grub2 again. As I see your Ubuntu installation is at /dev/sdb, the commands will be  \nsudo grub-install /dev/sdb\nsudo update-grub \n\nWhat was the cause of the problem:\nGrub2 looks for the Windows boot files for detecting Windows entries. Though you removed Windows 7, the Windows 7 boot files aren't removed (which are \"Boot\" folder and \"bootmgr\" file). And as Windows 7 boot files are there, grub2 simply assumes that, there are Windows 7 installation also. Hence the dual entry.\n\nA: You should find what you're looking for inside of /boot/grub/grub.cfg. This file is dynamically generated by update-grub2. I am dual booting Ubuntu 32bit and 64bit. If I wanted to remove one, I would simply delete it's section from this file. Here is what one of my entries looks like-\nmenuentry 'Ubuntu, with Linux 3.2.0-23-generic' --class ubuntu --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os {\n    recordfail\n    gfxmode $linux_gfx_mode\n    insmod gzio\n    insmod part_msdos\n    insmod ext2\n    set root='(hd0,msdos2)'\n    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 94916094-afe9-4b74-9413-a3c54b39eb91\n    linux   /boot/vmlinuz-3.2.0-23-generic root=UUID=94916094-afe9-4b74-9413-a3c54b39eb91 ro   quiet splash $vt_handoff\n    initrd  /boot/initrd.img-3.2.0-23-generic\n}\n\nChanges should take effect immediately, so make a backup and be careful. Also, anything you change in this file will be completely over written if you run update-grub2 again.\n", "Q: Cannot install themes due to permissions error I have looked up several tutorials online, they all have one thing that I don't have on my screen a menu that brings them through \"System > Preferences > Appearance.\" I also can't find my .themes folder, unless I am in GNOME 3 but I am not allowed to add anything to it. It tells me i am not the owner even though I am set up as admin. \nCan anyone recommend anything? \n\nA: *\n\n*Download a Theme\n\n*Extract the theme\n\n*Move the Theme folder to home/.themes/ (Make sure the folder structure is correct; inside the theme folder there should be a gtk3.0, metacity,gtk2 and possibly a gnome-shell folders) if you don't have the hidden folder ( .) makes a hidden folder create it, to make it show up press CTRL+H.\n\n*Select it with Gnome Tweak Tool, Install it if you don't have it.\n\n\nA: To download and install then visit this link.\nInstall Ubuntu-Tweaks  to download or change theme. \nTo install, type into a terminal\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ubuntu-tweak\n\nOr install gnome tweak tool to change theme.

I have a netbook running Ubuntu. the Ubuntu Software Center is too slow and I like add/remove applications more than I do the Ubuntu Software Center. when I try fedora I like the add/remove applications but how do I get on Ubuntu 12.04? \n\nA: Try Synaptic Manager.\n\nWhich provides a thorough Package installation and Uninstallation option, with Sub-Menus such as Section, Origin, Status, Custom Filters, based on type of package/software.\nBut i will advise you to give another try to Ubuntu Software centre , you can explore it as here \n \nYou can Install and Uninstall quite Easily compared to Synaptic here, you just have to choose the right options as example in the screenshot , just expand them to see it.\nThird option would be apt-get to remove and install packages. \n\nA: AFAIK you have only one alternative - the Terminal. It's really straightforward. Three commands or so and you're set to use it for adding/removing programs. Quick examples:\nTo install firefox:\nsudo apt-get install firefox\n\nTo remove firefox:\nsudo apt-get remove firefox\n\nTo install a program from external repository (\"repo\") first you need to add the repository. To install ppa:alexx2000/doublecmd repository :\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:alexx2000/doublecmd\nsudo apt-get update\n\nI wouldn't recommend Synaptic manager. From my experience the risk of breaking your system is much higher when using Synaptic when compared to the Terminal (since you really limit your actions to copy/paste into Terminal anyway). If you try out many programs I'd recommend leaving the Software Center running. It's slowest when starting up for the first time after booting your system. After that it runs bearable. Give it another try.\n\nA: You can do it easily from \n\nSynaptic Package Manager\n\n. To install it open a terminal & type  sudo apt-get install synaptic. Then run it from application menu. Click on status....search......\"Right click\" and select Full remove or similar option. Then click apply. Done.\nOr you can uninstall your software by terminal.

Graphically and through command Line. \n\nAnd same thing happen when i tried to install a theme ,  terminal slapped me with this message \" umairmustafa is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.\"\nWhat on earth is going on. \n\nA: It sounds like you may have removed yourself from the \"sudo\" group - did you edit your user group memberships recently?  In order to use sudo, you need to be a member of this group, or specifically added to the sudoers file.  However, if you remove this group membership, only someone with root authority can add it back or make a change.  You won't be able to install anything new, either.\nNote that prior to 12.04, Ubuntu used the \"admin\" group instead of the \"sudo\" group, where Debian used the \"sudo\" group.  So, if you upgraded to 12.04, it's possible that you may have been a member of the admin group rather than sudo.  Either or both will work, but I'd imagine that \"sudo\" should now be the preferred group for administrative users.\nTo confirm if this is your problem, try entering \"groups\" at a commandline in the terminal.  If you don't see either \"admin\" or \"sudo\" (one or both), then this is your problem.  If you do see one of them, then you may need to directly edit your /etc/sudoers file (as root, of course).\nBut don't despair, there is a way to get around this, although it's not as simple as most people would like.  You will need to gain root access, which can be done at startup with a little work.\nFirst, you need to log in to a single user console mode: here is a good how-to for that.  It tells how to fix a variety of causes for the problem you are having (apparently).  It's slightly dated, and uses \"admin\" group instead of \"sudo\", so substitute accordingly.\n", "Q: Changing to static IP?

To create each Box with widgets at run-time, I create a new GtkBuilder, call add_from_string passing in the text from the .ui file Glade creates, and then use the object returned from get_object(\"box1\") in the UI. \nI know I could create the widgets with code, but for now, I'd like to use the .ui files Glade creates. It seems inefficient though to instantiate a new GtkBuilder object and the wasted Window object for every Box I want to create. Is there a more efficient method to load .ui files without creating a new GtkWidget object and wasted Window object?\nThanks,\nVance\n\nA: If you want to fill up your GUI with new widgets while your app is running, it is completely wrong to create a bunch of separate .ui files and GtkBuilders for them. It is very easy to create a single widget from withing the code.\nI assume you use Python, since you've tagged your question as pygtk.\nHave a look at a simple example:\nfrom gi.repository import Gtk\n\nand:\nmy_window = Gtk.Window()\nmy_button = Gtk.Button()\nmy_window.add(my_button)\nmy_window.show_all()\n\nWell, it won't really work on it's own, but that's how you can create new widgets. For details on particular widgets, head to this elegant tutorial/docs: http://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.org/\n\nA: If you want different chunks shoved in different areas at run-time, you can build one glade file with loads of windows and re-parent them.

I was wondering if it is possible to log into a tty session (not the GUI) as a guest?\nAs far as my observation goes the guest session provided at login are served by lightdm which dynamically creates those guest accounts (correct me if I'm wrong) but how would that be done in a tty login because it requires a login and a password ?\n\nA: No, you can't and I will try to explain you why. There are two things that prevents you to login to tty as guest:\n\n\n*\n\n*The default shell for guest accounts is set to /bin/false. You can check this with the following command (the shell is set on the last field on each line):\ngrep guest /etc/passwd\n\n/bin/false is just a binary that immediately exits, returning false, when its called, so when someone who has false as shell logs in, they're immediately logged out when false exits. \n\n*The password for any guest account is disabled by default and this is absolutely normally: if you invite someone in your house, you don't give him your house keys.\nBecause of this nobody can't login normally[1] in any interactive login[2] shell. You can check this with the following command (the password is set on the second field on each line):\ngrep guest /etc/shadow\n\n[1] I said normally, because you can switch from a real user to a user with the password disabled using sudo su user_with_no_passwd (like in real life: when someone knocks on your door, you open him with your keys).\n[2] tty1-6 wast (and I suppose it will be) all the time an interactive login shell. And this world - login - it suggest me that I must to have a password to get over it (like in real life: when you see a lock, you need a key to open it).\n\nNow, if you still want to login to tty as guest, follow the instructions from the below ttyrecord image:\n\nAnd now you can go in tty and login as guest... a guest with password... which means that it is not anymore a guest...\n\nA: To achieve what you want, I would suggest doing it the \"old fashioned\" way. Simply create a new user name GuestUser. Give them limited permissions, and you can optionally give them a password or not. If you want GuestUser to have no password, you will probably have to modify PAM authentication a bit to allow passwordless logins.

I'm using ubuntu 12.04 and I have a first generation iphone,16Gb. The iphone is jailbroken.\nUnder 10.04, I was able to transfer music onto the phone. I used banshee.\nUnder 12.04, ubuntu can see the iphone and it's file system. But can't transfer music.\nIf I just plug the iphone in, rhythymbox can't see the iphone. Banshee can see it sometimes, but can't see it's music, and can't transfer music onto it. Attempts to copy over tracks fail with the error \"mp3 format is not supported by the device and no converter was found to convert it\"\nIf I plug in the iphone and start nautilus, nautilus can see the iphone, and gives me options for opening it: rhythymbox or a photo management application.\nIf I then open the phone in rhythymbox, I can see the music collection. But when I attempt to copy files over, the syncing process seems to take forever. The only way to end it is to cancel the sync. Afterwards, no new tracks have been added.\nSo, how do I transfer file over to my iphone from ubuntu 12.04?\n\nA: so far the only way ive been able to put music in my iphone is by installing an app called MEWSEEK. once installed, connect the iphone to the pc, copy all the songs to the folder DOWNLOADS (just the mp3 files NOT carpets) then unplugg the iphone and run the mewseek app, go to the downloads section (all the songs u copied must be there) at the top right tap the sync option. and done it will sync the songs.\nNote: the iphone must be jailbroken, otherwise this wont work.\n\nA: If your iPhone is running on iOS 5, you cannot accomplish this as of yet with Ubuntu.\n\"14.10.2011: iOS 5 music sync has a lot of changes.

Does your laptop support that feature? If it does, it usually displays this on the boot screen\nI would recommend to plug a USB drive, boot and activate boot menu by pressing F12 or whatever you have there. If USB is recognized by BIOS and is bootable, the BIOS would display it in the list of boot options. If you don't see it in the list, there you go, your problem is BIOS can not read the flash, so maybe you should use a different one.\nIf a drive is in fact shown in the list of options, see if you can boot it.

Can I access these files? Can I change the partition type without having to reformat?\n\nA: The first thing is to make sure that you don't use that partition. Unmount it straight away if you are running the installed OS. Or just turn off the PC.\nBoot from a utility disk with PARTED on it and mark the partition as whatever it was before, probably EXT2/3 if it was Linux. Then mount the partition and see if you can read the data. There is a reasonable chance that most of the data will be ok.\nHowever, when you did the installation, there is also a good chance that the installer actually formatted the partition. If this is the case, it is less likely that the data can be recovered. But you can use a partition undelete tool to try. If you've done the above, unmount, put the partition type back to swp then run the undelete partition tool & follow the instructions.\nThere are too many partition undelete tools to list here but I did a quick Google search which returned a load of useful links.\nRecommended recovery boot OS's:\n\n\n*\n\n*Knoppix\n\n*System Rescue CD\n\n*Ultimate Boot CD\n", "Q: help with fixing fwts errors log Here is an extract of results.log:\nMTRR validation.\nTest 1 of 3: Validate the kernel MTRR IOMEM setup.\nFAILED [MEDIUM] MTRRIncorrectAttr: Test 1, Memory range 0xc0000000 to 0xdfffffff (PCI Bus 0000:00)\nhas incorrect attribute Write-Combining.\nFAILED [MEDIUM] MTRRIncorrectAttr: Test 1, Memory range 0xfee01000 to 0xffffffff (PCI Bus 0000:00)\nhas incorrect attribute Write-Protect.\n    ====================================================================================================\n\nTest 1 of 1: Kernel log error check.\nKernel message: [ 0.208079] [Firmware Bug]: ACPI: BIOS _OSI(Linux) query ignored\n\nADVICE: This is not exactly a failure mode but a warning from the kernel.

The kernel does try to workaround problematic firmware but usually to get these kind of issues fixed one has to pester the BIOS vendor to fix this issues. \nBest to refer to the fwts reference wiki.\n", "Q: Wipe 12.04/Windows 7 dual boot setup and start fresh new 12.04 I have an Asus u56e laptop running dual boot setup, Windows 7 and 12.04. I had Windows 7 first. I was wondering what's the easiest way possible to erase/format my drive (500GB) so that it deletes Ubuntu and Windows 7 so I can reinstall 12.04 onto my whole drive? Does the Ubuntu Live CD help make this a possibility or is there something with gparted I have to tinker with? I've already got everything I need backed up. Any help would be much appreciated.\n\nA: If you don't have Ubuntu anymore, or you can't find the installation CD, go to the Ubuntu website to download Ubuntu. Choose the 32bit or 64bit version depending on your system. Burn the ISO to a CD.  Once that is done, boot from the newly created CD, make sure that you system is set to boot from CD.\nWhen you get to the Installation Type screen, choose erase and install. \n\nContinue the installation following the on screen instructions.\nFor more control over you disk, you can choose Something else.   and create an ext4 primary partition with the mount point / and leave some sapce to create a logical partition for swaparea.  The size of swaparea depends on the amount of RAM you have.  So I would say it would be safe to have 2GB of swap space.\n", "Q: xubuntu 12.04 restarts after suspend - only from my account After installing a clean xubuntu 12.04 I noticed that when I suspend, the computer suspends and turns itself off (you see the lights go off, and a click sound from the HD or fans), but then about 2 seconds later it turns itself back on again...\nThe odd thing is that:\n\n\n*\n\n*It doesn't happen when booting from the liveCD\n\n*I created another user account. When I log onto this account I can suspend fine. The computer stays off until I press the ON button\n\n*When I remove my .config folder and it's clean - I can also suspend without problem on my account\n\n\nSo it seems that something in my user config is causing this, but I can't work out what it might be. I tried diffing the two .config folders, and also all processes running with one account compared to the other (ps -ef |grep <username>), but couldn't find anything obvious that might be causing this...\nUPDATE:\nAs requested, here's the kern.log - with embeedded comments inside. It shows turning the computer on, logging in as the account that can suspend, suspending successfully, then turning off and on again, this time with my account, suspending (but only for about 2 seconds and then the computer starts again)\nand ~/.config contents + dmesg output\n\nA: I looked thoroughly through your log files and couldn't decipher what the issue was. What I would do in your situation is run a script that removes almost all my .config folders, and replaces them one by one as I successfully test the machine in suspend mode. Something like this:\nFOLDERS=$(ls .config | grep -v \"gtk\" -v \"gnome\") #Use -v to exclude any folders.\nfor f in \"$FOLDERS\"; do\n     mv \"$f\" \"$f-\" #Instead of deleting folders, we just rename them with a hyphen at the end.\ndone\n\nfor f in \"$FOLDERS\"; do\n    echo \"Test putting you system to sleep, then press enter to re-enable the next config folder\"\n    read i #Reads the enter key.\n    mv \"$f-\" \"$f\"\n    echo \"Replaced folder: .config/$f\"\n    echo \"$f\" > corruptfolder.txt #This file will remember the last folder incase you forget.\ndone\n\nNote that if you are successful, this script will not finish running (because your computer powered off). You will have correct the folder names that still have a hyphen at the end. Use this loop to do that:\nFOLDERS=$(ls .config)\nfor f in \"$FOLDERS\"; do\n    tmp=$(echo \"$f\" | sed 's/-$//')\n    [ \"$tmp\" != \"$f\" ] && mv \"$f\" \"$tmp\"\ndone\n\n\nA: exact same symptom - select 'suspend' from the 'gears' icon drop-dwn menu. Result is the same loop to restart describe by OP.\nENV - kernel 3.6.1-030601-generic #201210071322\nENV - Hardware samsung series 9 \nOrig. OS was 12.04 before the kernel upgrade\nSolution - System/settings/power app and tweeked the settings for 'sleep' both on and off the battery. Made sure that there was config val that would request sleep at some threshold regardless of whether mode= battery power or mode=plugged in. \nLoop/restart symptom ended after power setting tweeks.  \n\nA: UPDATE: this doesn't work any more. I have no idea why... still experiencing the same issue :(\nWhat solved this eventually for me was turning off the Display Power Management. Go figure why...\nOn xubuntu, go to Settings->Settings Manager click on Screensaver, Advanced and under Display Power Management untick Power management enabled option.\nSince then I am able to suspend without the system going back on :)\n\nA: I had the same symptom. It disappeared when I changed my nVidia graphics card driver from \"version 173-updates\" to \"version 319\"\nI am using HP pavilion dv2000 running 12.04 with Kernel Version 3.5.0-43-generic.\n", "Q: How do I catch exception from sed when trying to read a non-existent file and write a handler for it?

The runtime performance is immaculate otherwise.\nEven though not needed, I still set swappiness = 10. I've tried the quiet splash profile to GRUB; already have preload installed. But it still is pretty slow. I am not too confident on recompiling the kernel yet. But you could please advice me on that too.\nI've also added the following to fstab:\n#Move /tmp to RAM:\ntmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,noexec,nosuid 0 0\n\n(Also if you could please tell me the exact implication/scope of this tweak on physical ram & the swap.)\nBut nothing has happened really. So what alternatives are there to make it boot faster?\n\nAlso, right after fresh install, though no swap partition, the system still showed /dev/zram0 of arond 2GB which was never used (probably because of the above fstab edit).\nFinally, I experimented with Hibernate a little, but many claim that it doesn't work on 12.04. (Not to mention, I made a swap file of 4GB for it). What I did was:\nsudo gedit /var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d/hibernate.pkla\n\nThen I added the following lines, saved the file, and closed the text editor:\n[Re-enable Hibernate]\nIdentity=unix-user:*\nAction=org.freedesktop.upower.hibernate\nResultActive=yes\n\nI also edited the upower policy for hibernate:\ngksudo gedit /usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.upower.policy\n\nI added these lines:\n< allow_inactive >no< /allow_inactive >\n< allow_active >yes< /allow_active >\n\nBut it did not work. So is there an alternate method perhaps that can make it work on 12.04?\n\nA: Regarding the instability, kernel developers recommend always using swap. Maybe you should add a small zram swap (install zram-config and edit /etc/init/zram-config.conf), or disk swap.\nTo address slow boot you could look at what's taking the time with bootchart. Impossible to really offer any more advice without knowing specifics.\nHibernating to a swap file is apparently not possible by default. (Not sure if that thread's still valid.) You could create a swap partition. I would make it at least 5GB just to have some room in case something is swapped and to make sure you avoid any GB vs. GiB problems. I personally haven't had problems with hibernate on 4GB RAM and 8GB swap partition.\n", "Q: Add console/text booting mode to grub menu I want to have text booting mode option on grub menu screen. How do I create this menu entry?\n\nA: In my research, there are two ways to do this:\nMethod 1\nHack 10_linux script in /etc/grub.d/ and insert generation codes for text booting menuentry\nAdvantages:\n\n*\n\n*Generates text booting menuentry for all installed kernel versions\n\n*Takes care of new or redundant menuentries when you install/purge\nkernels\n\nDownsides:\n\n*\n\n*Requires deep understanding of shell scripting\n\n*The script source file may vary from one grub version to another\n\n*Edits need to be redone if grub package updates overwrite the modified script\n\nMethod 2\nUse designated script for adding custom grub menuentry in /etc/grub.d\nAdvantages:\n\n*\n\n*Easiest and least complicated\n\n*No chance of being overwritten so you do it only once\n\nDownsides:\n\n*\n\n*Only if you want each of your installed kernel versions to have text\nbooting menuentry:\n\n*\n\n*Lots of work and harder to maintain\n\n*Leaving behind redundant menuentries when you purge old kernel versions\n\n\n\n\nIn this short step, I'm going with method #2 since it's the easiest to explain here and we'll be creating text booting menuentry only for the latest kernel image that you use.\n\n*\n\n*The first thing that you need is the already generated menuentry for\nyour latest kernel. We are going to copy and use it as basis for our\ncustom menuentry, with a little alteration. For that, you need to\nlook in your /boot/grub/grub.cfg file. Locate the first menuentry\nstanza that points to the latest kernel on your Ubuntu. If you're\ndual booting with other linux distros, pay extra attention so you\nwouldn't mix it up with their menuentries.\n\n\n*Once you found it, copy the entire menuentry stanza and paste it\ninto /etc/grub.d/40_custom file. It may look like one below. Let's\nuse this as example:\nmenuentry 'Ubuntu' --class ubuntu --class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os $menuentry_id_option 'gnulinux-simple-a4e6d610-122e-42e2-8497-39eae02816e8' {\n  recordfail\n  load_video\n  gfxmode $linux_gfx_mode\n  insmod gzio\n  insmod part_gpt\n  insmod ext2\n  set root='hd0,gpt2'\n  if [ x$feature_platform_search_hint = xy ]; then\n    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root --hint-bios=hd0,gpt2 --hint-efi=hd0,gpt2 --hint-baremetal=ahci0,gpt2  a4e6d610-122e-42e2-8497-39eae02816e8\n  else\n    search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root a4e6d610-122e-42e2-8497-39eae02816e8\n  fi\n  linux   /boot/vmlinuz-3.8.0-31-generic root=UUID=a4e6d610-122e-42e2-8497-39eae02816e8 ro   quiet splash $vt_handoff\n  initrd  /boot/initrd.img-3.8.0-31-generic\n}\n\n\n\n*Now here's few things that you need to edit in this stanza before you can save the file:\n\n*\n\n*The menuentry title. Change 'Ubuntu' in menuentry line to 'Ubuntu (text mode)'\n\n*Path to vmlinuz file in linux line. Substitute /boot/vmlinuz-3.8.0-31-generic with /vmlinuz\ngrub boot parameter at the end of linux line. Substitute quiet splash with text\n\n*Path to initrd image in initrd line. Substitute /boot/initrd.img-3.8.0-31-generic with /initrd.img\n\n\n\n*Reason why we do the substitutions in both vmlinuz and initrd lines is to take advantages of the symlinks placed in / which points to their latest version in /boot dir so that our custom menuentry can always point to the most recent kernel and won't need to be changed if a new kernel is introduced.\n\n\n*That's it. Execute sudo update-grub to generate the custom menu and you're done.\n\nA: See:\nThe Grub 2 Guide\nIf I have some time, I will try to document how ...\n", "Q: How many maximum CPUs does Ubuntu support by default?  I think this is kernel dependent and probably will change over time depending on the kernel a release uses, correct me if wrong\nI'd like to know two things for all the currently supported Ubuntu releases:\nHow many maximum CPUs can Ubuntu handle (by default) at the same time with a standard desktop kernel? Is that count different from a server kernel and 32bit/64bit systems?\nWhere can I find that information on my system?\n\nA: All I know for sure is that precise (12.04) desktop 64-bit -generic kernel supports maximum 256 cpus (by default).\nYou can find the number of CPUs your kernel config supports by doing:\ngrep CONFIG_NR_CPUS /boot/config-`uname -r`\n\n\nA: It all comes down to how one would define physical CPUs.

I bought my kids a PC and installed 12.04 (Unity) on it.  The bottom line is, I want my children to use the computer unsupervised while I have confidence they cannot access anything inappropriate.\nWhat I have looked at:\nI was looking at Scrubit a tool which allows me configure my wifi router to block content and this solution would also protect my other PC and mobile devices.  This may be overkill as I just want the solution to work on one PC.  \nI also did some Google searches and came across the application called Nanny (it seems to look the part).  My experience of OSS is that the best solutions frequently never appear first on a Google search list and in this case I need to trust the methods therefore my question is very specific. \nI want to leverage your knowledge and experience to understand What is the best way to restrict adult content on 12.04 LTS as this is important to me.  It maybe a combination of things so please don't answer this question \"try this or that\", then give me some PPA unless you can share your experience of how good it is and of course if there are any constraints.\n\nA: I took the advice of the selected answer to this question and used OpenDNS on my Ubuntu computer but I wanted to share more information to be helpful to others.  \nWhat is OpenDNS, and how to get OpenDNS?\nOpenDNS is a free DNS service that can not only speed up your internet but also provide you options like...\n\n\n*\n\n*Web content filtering\n\n*anti-phishing,\n\n*malware protection\n\n*smart cache and much more.\nThe bottom line is OpenDNS servers have a huge collection IP addresses of millions of web pages. When you look for a website, it immediately finds the corresponding IP address and hence gets it to load faster.   It's intuitive and literally takes less than 10 minutes to set up (no software installation required)\nTo utilize all its features, all you need to do is sign-up with them here.  Basic OpenDNS is suitable for your household devices is free of cost. (For business solutions there is a nominal annual fee)\nOnce you have signed up, you’ll get a confirmation link in your mailbox. Click on the link and it will redirect you to dashboard settings on the main website.\nIt will automatically detect your IP address. Click on Add this network button given below your IP address  All you need to now is to follow the Instructions provided on the website and add these IP addresses to your router.\nPreferred DNS server: 208.67.222.222\nAlternate DNS server: 208.67.220.220\n\nThat's it! You're done\nOpenDNS features\nBy default, nothing is blocked. You have FULL control to select one of 3 pre-sets 1: Low 2: Moderate or 3: High filtering levels\nExample: If you choose “Low” filtering level then all the porn sites will be blocked . You increase the filter level to apply more restrictions.  There is also a custom filtering levels that allows you to be specific or tweak one of the pre-sets.\nYou can block or allow any domain of your choice by entering the domain name. It also gives you the ability to add an extra layer of security as it provides malware and botnet protection as well as phishing protection. You may also block internal IP addresses.\nImportant note of caution:\nI have been using OpenDNS for a couple of weeks now and I created a Bookmark in Firefox. Stupidly I clicked on \"Remember my Password\" which means anybody can click on the bookmark get into OpenDNS and make changes.  I have since rectified.\n\nA: *\n\n*Check your Internet history files.\nThis will tell you if your children are visiting any inappropriate sites. In your web browser, click on the history tab. It should open up as a sidebar. Once this happens, you can check to see what sites your children are visiting. Take note of any that you want to block.\n\n\n*Adjust your privacy settings.\nIn most browsers, the privacy tab is located under Internet options (or options), which is located under the tools tab. Once in the website section, copy the sites that you want to block from the history page, and enter them into the block site space. You can block one site at a time this way. However, in order to block sites that your children have never visited before, you will need to take other steps.\n\n\n*Purchase a site-blocking software package.\nThis will give you the additional security option of blocking any site that may have potentially harmful content from your children. Many of these programs not only block harmful sites, but also are used as a way to see exactly what your children are doing online or on the computer in general. Install the program and set the level of security you want. Usually these programs can be customized to fit your needs.\n\n\n*Check the software and your Internet history after your child uses the computer.\nIf any inappropriate activity is going on, talk to your children about it in a calm manner. If you freak out, your child will try to hide things from you even more.\n\n\n*Place the computer in a well-used area where you can visually keep track of what the children are doing.\nIf the computer is in the same room as you, your children are much less likely to do anything inappropriate. Limit Internet time as much as possible and set clear boundaries for appropriate use.\n\nA: One easy and great way of doing it is going straight to the source and use DNS filtering for that purpose.\nLet's face it, you cannot protect your children all the time from all the internet risks, but using some sort of filtering you can at least force it in your home.\nOne of the advantages of filtering using DNS is that even if you have a smart ass kid that knows he can bypass blocking software installed in his system using the Ubuntu LiveCD, DNS usage can be enforced in the system that use DHCP via your router.\nHave a look at a DNS parental control option like OpenDSN Family Shield or Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 for Familiesfor an example on how a DNS filter would work for your computers at home. Many other DNS servers will allow you to do it, OpenDNS is just one that I use normally.\nSet up an account, make the changes in your router to use the DNS servers from OpenDNS, activate parental filtering and no matter what OS your kids are using that obtain an IP via the router will be blocked from accessing issue sites.\nOf course if your kids are smart enough and know how to spoof that it will be easy for them to bypass it, that again, as said before, you won't be able to protect your children all the time from all the dangers the internet presents.\n\nA: The Internet is not a safe place for kids\nWe all know of content we don't want our kids to be exposed to, be it either accidentally or on purpose. We therefore have to do something about it. There are different approaches to gain some security but all fail when it comes to the details. Let me explain why:\nAllow list / Whitelists\nWhitelists securely block unwanted content and can be generated by a variety of browser plugins or parental control software but they will not last for long. We want our kids to discover the world, to learn how to operate the Internet, to learn how to find information, and to learn how to play games that are safe for them. They will not learn how to do this if they only have access to a small list of sites granted by Daddy where the next click on a button leads to the \"BANNED\" page. Only very young kids may be happy for some months with a whitelist.\nDeny list / Blacklists\nBlacklists such as offered e.g. by DNS services are meant to contain all known bad sites and block them. This task is ridiculous. We can not possibly know of all bad sites. They pop up everyday in thousands. The makers of Dansguardian filters put it like that:\n\nThe web is a fast changing place and even large web search engines such as Google or Altavista or Yahoo don't even know of half of it. This makes filtering by web address (URL) difficult as sites change and new ones come up all the time.\n\nContent Filters\nTo overcome limitations of a blacklist we additionally need some sort of content filtering but it is tedious to maintain the filters. This may be good for schools when a full time employee does all the work but it is unlikely we find the time at home to do so. Using pre-made filters is likely a bad idea as the bad sites know about them and avoid those suspicious phrases to appear on their pages (look at the spam mail you get and you have an idea on how they do it).\nSmart Kids\nAs already mentioned kids become smart, and we desperately want them to become so. Unortunately then they will also learn how to overcome most of our filters. They will (yes, they will, no matter what we do)  gain access to anything they want by the time they are smart. All our blocking efforts will fail by then. Before that however they may not be interested in all that adult stuff at all. So there would in reality not be a need to block anything. By the time they are smart they need to be smart enough to know what is a bad site, and they should be smart enough to be interested in other things rather than visits on adult pages.\nSmart Parents\nWe all are or will be smart parents. We want to teach our kids how to operate Ubuntu and how to discover the Internet. Smart parents watch what their kids do and they talk to them about what they do. We should provide them with the knowledge on what to do when they come to sites that are different or may be harmful. We want our kids to tell us what they do. Smart parents spent the time they would need to set up and maintain a parental control rather with their kids. We also should not leave the kids alone. Put the computer to a place where you can pass by and have a short look what is displayed on the screen.\nIn summary the \"best\" way to refrain our kids from visiting unwanted sites is to become a smart parent educating their kids to become smart. But I know from my own experience that this also may fail, has inconsistencies, and may likely not achieve 100% safety. It still is the best.\n\nNote after seven years: We never had any content filters in all those years. I can see now how important all I said above was to our kids.\n\nA: In addition to OpenDNS there are Parental Control Systems that are an easy way to control what your kids are doing in the computer.\n\n\n*\n\n*You can limit how much time a day each one of them is browsing the\nweb,  chatting or doing email. \n\n*You can decide at which times of the day they can do this things as\nwell.\n\n*You can block all undesirable webs and have your kids  enjoy the\ninternet with ease of mind, no more worries!\n\n\nThe Binary package “Nanny” for ubuntu Precise (12.04) can be found here\nOR\nYou can install the debs package from here\nNote:\nExperienced Linux users can also try DansGuardian along with content caching using squid3\n.\n\nA: Depending on your religious persuasion maybe try Christian Ubuntu flavour which when I was researching Ubuntu flavours had this as an inbuilt feature which they advertise.\n\nA: An alternative solution would be to setup a Pie Hole server at home, here is a complete tutorial on how to do just that.\nhttp://www.ubuntuboss.com/how-to-install-piehole-on-ubuntu-16-04/\nPi Hole is a nifty open source project that allows you to offload the task of blocking advertisements and annoying (and often malicious) trackers to a Raspberry Pi or in this case an Ubuntu Server.

It's normal for the GNOME VFS mounts folder ~/.gvfs to be impervious to manual changes, since it's perpetually locked and in use (what you read on Launchpad is correct). You could try chowning it without sudo and that might succeed, but really that folder is extremely unlikely to be relevant to the problem you're experiencing. The contents of that folder are not likely to be responsible for any problems authenticating to log in or to perform administrative tasks (including in the Software Center).\nIf this was your only error message, it probably means that answer didn't work for you, and you'll have to seek other possible solutions to your problem in that question.\n", "Q: Upload a folder?

Maybe it can be done using Ubuntu One / CouchDB APIs in Python by publicating an hosted image and then getting the public link.\n\nA: As you've found out already, the Gwibber API deals only with posting content to social networks.\nIf you want to host media such as pictures, on an external service, you'll need to find a public hosting service that has an API, get the public URL for the media item and pass it to Gwibber.\nThere are multiple services that you can use.

First I've tried to burn it on a rewritable CD, but when I inserted it into my DELL DVD drive, the computer couldn't read it.\nSo I thought of burning the Ubuntu ISO on a 2 GB USB flash drive. I've used the process described here:\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows\nthat means that I used the \"Universal USB Installer\" program, and it \"burned\" the Ubuntu ISO on my pendrive. All the files have been correctly written on the pendrive.\nSo, after changing the boot sequence on my Dell pc (I moved the USB device before hard disk), I started the pc with the pendrive inserted.\nAn Ubuntu start menu appeared. I tried two of the functions in the list:\n1) Run Ubuntu from this USB\n2) Install Ubuntu on a Hard Disk\nThen, in both cases, this appears on the screen:\nLoading /casper/vmlinuz......\nLoading /casper/initrd.lz.............ready.\nBut then, nothing. The cursors blinks and nothing happens. Why?\nThank you very much for your help! :)\nPS: a second question: when I will be able to use Ubuntu, will I be able to see the Windows XP and personal files on the my hard disk?\n--- EDITED MESSAGE ---\nOk, I did some test and here are some new info.\nFirst of all, I succeeded in starting up Ubuntu using the CD, one time. The DVD drive is not working correctly since many months, but sometimes it works. Actually I can't remember if the orange background appeared, but surely this was the last thing I read on the black screen:\n--\n* Starting configure network device security\n* Starting configure network device \n* Starting crash report submission daemon\n* Stopping anac(h)ronistic cron\n* Stopiing CPU interrupts balancing daeomn\n* Starting configure network device security\n* Starting configure network device\n* Checking battery state...\n* Stopping System V runlevel compatibility\n\n\n*\n\n*Stopping log initial device creation\n\n*Starting enable remaining boot-time encrypted block devices\n\n*Starting configure virtual network devices\n\n*Stopping configure virtual network devices\n\n*Starting configure network device security\n\n*Starting save udev log and update rules\n\n*Stopping save udev log and update rules\n* Stopping enable remaining boot-time encrypted block devices\nThen nothing.\nI can't start the installed Windows XP SO, and the laptop monitor is damaged (I can see only two thirds of the screen). So the only info I gathered are these:\n\n\n*\n\n*Pentium M\n\n*1.86 GHz\n\n*2 GB RAM\n\n*60 GB hard disk\n\n*NVIDIA GeForce (don't know which one)\n\n*CD/DVD+/-RW drive\n\n\nNow, I'd like to talk about the same two experiments (starting Ubuntu via CD and via USB on my old Dell laptop) that I did some hours ago on a more recent notebook of mine, a Toshiba A200, with Windows Seven Ultimate SP1 installed (I now, it's an \"old\" pc, but not as old as the Dell Inspiron, I think).\nHere are the Toshiba characteristics:\n\n\n*\n\n*Intel Core2 Duo\n\n*1.83GHz\n\n*2 GB RAM\n\n*ATI Mobility Radeon HD 2400\n\n*Hitachi hard disk (about 160 GB divided into two partitions: SO and data)\n\n*TSSTcorp CD/DVDW TS-L632D ATA Device\n\n\nI tried the Ubuntu CD on this pc, and it works correctly. I tested the SO without installing it, the orange background appeared, with menus, icons and windows, and I correctly read the files and folders in the two partitions of the hard disk. This demonstrates the the Ubuntu CD is valid. The problem is that works on the Toshiba but doesn't work on the Dell (because, as I already said, the DVD drive often doesn't read the disc, or, when the disc is read, the \"starting\" and \"stopping\" messages appears and finally everything stops.\nSo I tried the USB drive on the Toshiba, too. But I got the same results that I got when I used it on the Dell. The screen displayed:\n--\nLoading /casper/vmlinuz......\nLoading /casper/initrd.lz.............ready.\nSo I deducted that my Peak II 2GB that I \"burned\" the Ubuntu CD ISO onto is not usable on my two PCs.\nMy Dell laptop is failing and I'd just wanted to read the data on its hard drive (formatted with NTFS), using a live OS, the smallest possible one, and, knowing nothing of Linux, I thought of Ubuntu. But it didn't work. The Windows XP installed on the Dell doesn't start because of hard disk errors, and anyway, I can't find my Dell Windows XP CD, so I can't try to repair it.\nWhat can I do?\nThank you very much again!\nPS: I have a \"limited\" Internet connection (5GB of traffic each month for 20 Euros) so I would like not to use other money to download a different version of Ubuntu or of Linux, if possible.\nPPS: The \"1) Run Ubuntu from this USB 2) Install Ubuntu on a Hard Disk\" start menu that appears when I use my pendrive on both my laptops is not the one with the orange background and all the graphics. It's the simple one, on black background, a big Ubuntu logo and about 5 or 6 text rows to choose a startup function.\n\nA: Please try again with the Xubuntu or Lubuntu Desktop i386 LiveCDs. It looks like your system may not support the PAE feature required by the regular Ubuntu 12.04 LiveCD to boot. \nAnd yes, the LiveCD/LiveUSB should be able to read your Windws XP files (the drive should show as an icon on the desktop). \n", "Q: No longer running a gnome-session; how do I get the nice GTK theme back?

I have formatted 10Gb master as fat32 to use without partitioning for ubuntu as o/s. Can i format slave hdd 160Gb as ntfs and expect Ubuntu 12.04 to read and write to it? Any ideas? \n\nA: Yes, Ubuntu will read from and write to NTFS just fine.\nHowever, Ubuntu's ability to repair or recover data from a damaged NTFS partition is not as great. So you might want to use a filesystem like ext4, assuming you don't need to access it from other operating systems.\nAnother benefit of ext4 over NTFS is that Ubuntu will use CPU resources more efficiently to access ext4 (and most filesystems) than NTFS. But this is insignificant, in most use cases.\n\nA: Ubuntu (and Linux in general) does not install to fat32 or ntfs partitions. Also, you will need quit ea bit more than 10GB for the main OS partition, if it is not a server install. For example, my main partition is currently using 14 GB. You might want to just have the installer do the automatic partitioning.\nAs for reading and writing to NTFS, it is possible, but if you aren't using your system in a dual-boot fashion, and don't need to share data such as MP3s, Movies, etc… between Ubuntu and Windows both, then I'd recommend not bothering with NTFS as a partition for storing such data.\n", "Q: Can't find purchased apps in Kubuntu I installed Kubuntu 12.04 and am trying to install Humble Bundle through the software center which I installed with the software-center package.

Is it possible, what during the compilation, the package will be \"more adapted\" (performance, stability) to Your system, if it's compiled on it ?\n\nA: Unless you are doing serious optimization during the build, or making significant changes to what features you are building, for very complex programs, it is very unlikely you will see any performance benefit. And even with the serious optimizations, you will still only see minimal improvement. There's no real advantage to building applications in such a manner, on Ubuntu, for the most part.\n\nA: You will not get any performance boost if you recompile things on your system, unless your Ubuntu is highly customized, like using a lot of core libraries from another source. \nThe trick is that all packaged for Ubuntu are build on a real Ubuntu system, which uses the same packages at yours. That means that the building environment is 100% the same system, all libraries have identical bindings etc, only user config differs. Because of that, when binary packages are build, a lot of aggressive optimization can be applied, and they will be still valid on your system. This way Ubuntu can provide users with packages whose performance is maximized.\nThe chance that packages you compile on your own will have better performance is very low. It's even probable that they will be working slower, because a lot of optimization which is not enabled by default is manually triggered when building packages for Ubuntu repositories.\nConcerning stability, the reasoning is the same. Because packages are build on an Ubuntu system, which has exactly the same libraries as you do (provided you got them from repositories), there will be no difference in their behavior.\nConcluding, do not expect any profits when building apps on your own.\nHowever, if you use custom, modified libraries or core packages, that do not originate from Ubuntu repositories, it may be beneficial to rebuild applications which use them. However, most probably the difference will be so small that difficult to notice, so it may be not worth the hassle. \n\nA: I am a statistician who works in R. I am using a dual-boot system (Ubuntu/Windows 7). When I installed R from the Ubuntu repository (r-base, r-base-dev, ...), its performance was terrible! The time it took to run a certain script (calculate the trajectory of a particle in a loop) was 50% longer than on Windows! Disheartened, I purged the version of R supplied by Ubuntu and compiled my own with \"-march=native -O3\" flags for all compilers (CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, FFLAGS, OBJCFLAGS, FCFLAGS), and the result was... impressive to say the least. My scripts were running twice as fast as on Windows 7. Besides that, sometimes, official repositories contain prehistoric versions of libraries, and a developer might want to compile fresh libraries every time.\nBesides that, I also compiled the Linux kernel, but the gains were much more modest (5%). So it really depends on the software, how much it gains by using your native architecture etc. Some chess engines (like Stockfish) rely on sse and popcnt instructions, so if the default compiled binary—jack of all processors, master of the oldest—does not support the cool new stuff your processor is capable of, consider compiling it.\n\nA: Generally no, but there are exceptions here and there.\n\n\n*\n\n*Compiling Firefox 18 from source with flags \"-march=native -pipe -O2\" seemed to decrease those little periods of unresponsiveness during page loads, but nothing else changed.  Compiling it with flags \"-march=native -pipe -Os\" made it 16.5MB smaller in RAM.  It launched noticably faster as a consequence, and seems to take up less RAM with 30+ tabs open, but all the menu options seemed to take forever.\n\n*Compiling OpenArena from source with flags \"-march=native -pipe -O2\" increased avg framerate from 28.7 (timedemo results) to 33.4 over install from repository.  That's a big improvement.\n\n\nEverything else I've compiled from source either has , runs roughly the same, or sometimes breaks/runs like crap.\n", "Q: How can I allow unprivileged users to shutdown from the panel? (no sudo) I set up an old PC with Edubuntu 12.04 for my girls, with an admin account for myself and normal user accounts for both of them. Unfortunately, they are not able to shut down the computer by themselves with this configuration. Choosing shutdown from the (Unity) panel menu will log them out, but that's it. How do I give them shutdown privileges?\nPlease note that they are 5 and 7 years old and just starting to find their way around a computer. Solutions that would require them to open a terminal and sudo whatever are not helpful -- and I don't want them to be able to sudo anything, anyway. I need the panel menu entry \"Shutdown\" to work for them.\n\nA: Okay, I found it: The answer was actually very simple. Another user session was still open. My girls had just switched accounts instead of logging off. Of course, an unprivileged user issuing a shutdown command does not have any right to terminate another user's session, like a 'sudo shutdown' would.\n\nA: Its long but it will help you.\nLink \n", "Q: Clean Install of ubuntu from flash drive \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I install Ubuntu from an USB drive? \n\nCan I install Ubuntu to a newly formatted h/d from the flash drive?\n\nA: Presuming you aren't on an older computer which does not support booting from USB flash drives, then yes, you can install Ubuntu from a USB flash drive.

I couldn't find anything on the web.\n\nA: Pidgin itself has a widget it calls \"GtkIMHTML\" or similar, which is used for the chat windows. It, as most chat services do these days, supports a subset of HTML for conversations, which is used for embedding images and such. It is however, not a full HTML/Browser engine.\n\nA: DeWYSIWYGification Plugin 2.6.3 does what you wish. It can be reached via the pidgin-plugin-pack, usually installed via Synaptic and in the majority of the cases pre-installed with Pidgin itself.\n\nAfter installing, simply enable in the \"Plugins\" section. It has nothing configurable but will work exactly as you wish... \n\nUnfortunately, it only works uni-directional towards your contacts. Which means that your contacts will receive the links you send (as in your example to @dobey's comment) or any other html code you send.\nI am sorry if this doesn't fix your need to \"receive html\" but I post this answer just if you find it useful.\nGood luck!\n", "Q: How do I include image in my app from a url?

But qemu-img creates a 130GB file (even if theres not enough space on disk) from the 14GB vhd-file. Is this a common behavior ?\n\nA: If the size (or maximum-size) of the partition in the VHD is 130GB, then yes, it's normal. VHD/VDI support \"sparse\" disk files, i.e. they only take up the actual amount of space used, not the specified size. BIN has no such support, so the VHD will be expanded out to the full size, although it will mostly be zeros.\n", "Q: How to change Vuze download directory?

Here is the output of those commands http://paste.ubuntu.com/1071664/\n\nA: \nNote that the VideoRam setting you mention is only necessary/honored for the i810/815 chipsets; for newer ones, including your i845G, the manpage says:\nFor the 830M and later, the driver will automatically size  its  memory\nallocation  according  to the features it will support.  Therefore, the\nVideoRam option, which in the past had been  necessary  to  allow  more\nthan some small amount of memory to be allocated, is now ignored.\n\nIs there anything I can do to increase videoram size?\n\nYes, you should be able to increase the AGP aperture size (\"graphics memory\") in your BIOS (at computer start-up) from 128MB to a larger size.

I m using Ubuntu 12.04 and i have to partitions part1 and part2, both are ext4. I want to transfer media files to and from them freely through programs. \n\nA: What I would do is the following:\nAssuming you have both partitions mounted with the names part1 and part2, you will be the only one using them and you want total free control over them, I would do this:\nsudo chmod 777 /media/part1 - This would give all permissions (Read, Write, Execute) to you within the part1 partition.\nsudo chmod 777 /media/part2 - This would give all permissions (Read, Write, Execute) to you within the part2 partition.\nThe permissions (in this case 777) are as follow:\n7 - Full (Read, Write & Execute)\n6 - read and write\n5 - read and execute\n4 - read only\n3 - write and execute\n2 - write only\n1 - execute only\n0 - none  \nThe first 7 (Starting from the Left) is for the owner, the 2nd is for the group where the owner resides. The last 7 is for other groups. Basically like this you can copy anything you want in the partitions and if you ever need to take the HDD out and connect it to another computer with Ubuntu you will not have any problems with permissions. At least in my case it saves me time because I tend to have 1 or 2 hard drives that hold movies, music and similar stuff and I move them around from PC to PC.\nJust to add, if you do not know where the partitions are mounted, you can always open Disk Utility and in the information about the hard drive it will tell you where it is mounted. Remember that you need to apply this to the partition AFTER it has been mounted.\n\nA: Instead of changing all file permissions, like Luis Alvarado suggested, it would be better to change the file owner - thus keeping the executable bit on any binary and script files that previously had it.\nSo, assuming your partition is mounted as /media/something and your username is johndoe, you can run\nsudo chown -R johndoe:johndoe /media/something\n\nto change the owner and owning group of /media/something (and all files and directories it contains, hence the -R for 'recursive') to johndoe.\nThis way, all files will retain their permissions, but since you will be the owner of /media/something, you will be able to write to it and change any file permissions, in case you ever need to.\n\nA: I had the same problem and solved it by running nautilus as root, right click on the partition, properties, and changed the permissions (or owner if necessary).\nIf nautilus is not installed:\nsudo apt-get nautilus\n\n\nA: Change permission \n sudo chmod -R a+rwx /path/of/folder\n\n\nA: You can normally do this already, but my advice would be to add the partitions to /etc/fstab so they will be stable and have a location of your choosing.  You can mount them at any existing directory, but conventions seem to be to mount it at /mnt.  To do this, follow these steps:\nCreate the directories under /mnt; the directories can be whatever name you choose.  I will simply use \"MyMount1\" and \"MyMount2\" for an example.  Also, I will use \"mylogin\" to represent your login name and group; change this to your login account name.\nsudo mkdir /mnt/MyMount1\nsudo mkdir /mnt/MyMount2\nsudo chown mylogin:mylogin /mnt/MyMount1\nsudo chown mylogin:mylogin /mnt/MyMount1\n\nYou now have the two directories created, with you as the owner.\nYou need the UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) of the two drives to identify them in the fstab file.  To get these, run sudo blkid from a terminal commandline and find the partitions you want to use.  The easiest way to use them will be to copy and paste from the terminal to the file.\nOpen /etc/fstab using a text editor such as gedit.  To use gedit, enter\ngksu gedit /etc/fstab\n\nThen, enter these two lines at the end of the file  (but substitute the UUID for the xxx.... part, and the directory name for MyMounts):\nUUID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx /mnt/MyMount1 ext4 defaults 0 2\nUUID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx /mnt/MyMount2 ext4 defaults 0 2\n\nTo test, save the file and enter this at a terminal commandline: sudo mount -a; if there are any errors that you can't understand, ask here.  If there are errors and you need to reboot, it may be safest to disable the added lines first by prefixing the line with a pound sign (#) which makes it a comment.\n\nA: You should be able to mount the partition from nautilus (Ubuntu's default file manager).  If you look at the top left hand side of the window, you should be able to see all of the partitions you have on your drive.  Just click on one to mount it.\nHowever, if you want a given directory to always be mounted on startup, you need to add it to /etc/fstab.  The line that you would add should be something like:\n/dev/sda2  /media/part1    ext4    defaults    0   0\nThe format is \ndevice (tab) mount point (tab) type (in your case ext4) (tab) options (probably \"defaults\") (tab) dump (tab) pass (probably both 0 in your case)\nSo basically just replace /dev/sda2 with your device and /media/part1 with your mount point from the example.\nIf you need more info for editing your /etc/fstab, you could check out this article I found: http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html.\n", "Q: How do I upload a .deb created by Debreate to my PPA?

This question is closely related to other two questions: \"How to Add a Shortcut On Desktop\" and \"How do I add icons to the desktop in 10.04?\" (this being a closed question). And I know the answers mentioned there! The problem is it is not working.\nI just made a fresh Ubuntu 10.04 install a couple of days ago. Everything works fine for the main user: I can paste anything to the desktop, and it just works.\nBut I have created another user - as simple as it can be (no special settings; I just created a non-admin user and set its password).\nThen, I logged in using this other user account. I just want to create a link for a \"Games\" folder, for my son, and I simply can't! It doesn't accept \"paste\", and the right button mouse click does nothing.\nI have made several Ubuntu installations, several user accounts, and this never happened to me before! I tried to search some configuration/setting to fix it, but found nothing.\nI had to use the \"Preferences\" menu to be able to change the background/wallpaper image.\nIf I paste files / folders / links to the \"Desktop\" file system folder, it works (i.e., the files are copied / moved to the \"Desktop\" folder), but nothing appears in the desktop screen!\nAnd, what impressed me most, I found nothing searching on Google and Ask Ubuntu - I thought this would be a common issue... has anybody experienced this? Any clue to make the desktop just working normally?\nRemembering: all works fine for the first user (the admin user created when installing the system).\nThanks.\n\nA: Did you disable showing the desktop? As your regular user that is missing the shortcuts, run gconf-editor. Then navigate to Apps -> nautilus -> preferences and toggle the show_desktop option.\nAlso, make sure your regular user owns his desktop folder. i.e. \nsudo chown -R regularuser:regularuser /home/regularuser/Desktop\n\n", "Q: How do I change the Creation/Mod Date of all folders on a USB drive using Touch command? I've got a USB drive with mp3 music on it that I play in my car. My car has a USB drive port. Problem is that the car sorts the music by Creation/Modification Date (and not alphabetically). This makes it a pain to find what artist I'm looking for.\nTo solve this problem, I need a way to \"update\" the Creation/Modification Date for all folders on the USB drive every time I add a new folder of music to the USB drive. Anyone know how I can do this?\nThe Touch command works great, but the format touch <filename> would take forever to do on each folder on the drive. Anyway to select all folders on the drive and then touch <all folders>?\nOn my USB drive I have a folder for each album and the songs within each respective folder, like so: Album-1-folder Album-2-folder\nI need to apply the Touch command to each of the \"album\" folders on the drive.\n\nI stumbled upon a simple solution to solve this issue:touch /media/USB_Drive/*\n\nA: If you have a lot of files to touch, it's just going to take a while. You can plug-in the drive, and in a terminal, assuming your drive is mounted as /media/USB_DISK, do the following:\nfor i in `find /media/USB_DISK -type d|sed -e 's/ /%20/g'|sort`; do\n   echo $i|sed -e 's/%20/\\\\ /g'|xargs touch\ndone\n\nJust replace the USB_DISK with the proper name of the folder where your drive is mounted under the /media/ directory.\n\nA: Even if you get that to work, all files would have the same date. It doesn't sound like that would help.\nWhat would work is a script that has hard-coded file names. Hard-coding the file names is necessary to create your preferred order. Just \"touching\" them in the preferred order will \"create\" your order, so you don't need to enter actual dates into the touch command.\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncd /path/to/folder1\ntouch file1\nsleep 1\ntouch file4\nsleep 1\ntouch file2\nsleep 1\ntouch \"file 5 with spaces\"\n\ncd /path/to/folder2\ntouch file9\nsleep 1\ntouch file3\nsleep 1\n\nThe \"sleep\" commands are needed to force each \"touch\" to have a different time. Note that the file \"numbers\" don't matter, and are processed out of numerical order. The order in the script, however, creates the \"processing\" order.\nNote that you will need to update and run your script every time you add new songs/files.\nEdit: I just saw the \"sorted find\" post. That would probably work better. :)\n\nA: Dobey's answer is on the right track, but it will fail if any directory name contains a space. In general, it's not a good idea to use the output of find in a script for the same reason that the output of ls shouldn't be parsed by a script: File names can easily contain characters which make it difficult or impossible for a script to accurately interpret.\nThere are several options here. One is to use the -print0 switch to find combined with an appropriate call to xargs. See the respective man pages for details.\nThe approach I'm recommending is simpler for the specific problem at hand and uses shell globing to get accurate file names:\nfor i in /media/USB_Drive/*; do\n  [[ -d \"$i\" ]] || continue   # skip non-directories\n  echo \"touching $i...\"\n  touch \"$i\"\ndone\n\nNote that using a glob automatically results in an alphabetized list.\n", "Q: google chrome window resizes when click 12.04 kde All windows work fine but maximized G.

Would say, Super Meat Boy from the software center work? Or is all that computer good for is web browsing?\nIn other words, can a PowerPC G5 Processor work with Ubuntu applications, or is it doomed to be without support from all providers?\n\nA: For this machine, I would recommend Lubuntu.

The Humble Bundle games are also not likely available. Proprietary end-user applications are generally only available for x86 or x86_64 architectures on Linux. You could use an emulator to get it working on PowerPC possibly, but it would also almost certainly be unbearably slow and unplayable if you were to get it working.\n", "Q: Attempt to Upgrade is failing due to unstable mfc6490cwlpr:i386 I am attempting to upgrade to the most recent Ubuntu OS but i am being stopped with warning that mfc6490cwlpr:i386 is in a very bad inconsistent state. the warning suggests that I should reinstall before I remove this pkg. \nThe following is my attempt to do so.\ndpkg: warning: overriding problem because --force enabled:\n Package is in a very bad inconsistent state - you should\n reinstall it before attempting a removal.\n(Reading database ... 284218 files and directories currently installed.)\nRemoving mfc6490cwlpr:i386 ...\nstart: Unknown job: lpd\ndpkg: error processing mfc6490cwlpr:i386 (--remove):\n subprocess installed post-removal script returned error exit status 1\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n\nmfc6490cwlpr:i386\nme@mycomp-Studio-1737:~$ ^C\nkingston@kingston-Studio-1737:~$ sudo dpkg --configure -a\n[sudo] password for ME: \ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of mfc6490cwcupswrapper:i386:\n mfc6490cwcupswrapper:i386 depends on mfc6490cwlpr; however:\n  Package mfc6490cwlpr:i386 is not installed.\ndpkg: error processing mfc6490cwcupswrapper:i386 (--configure):\n dependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nErrors were encountered while processing:\n mfc6490cwcupswrapper:i386\nme@mycomp-Studio-1737:~$ sudo apt-get install mfc6490cwcupswrapper:i386\nReading package lists...

Then use dpkg -i mfc*.deb (if you are on i386 -- on 64bit you would need dpkg -i --force-all mfc*.deb instead) -- which fulfils the request of \"reinstall it\". Hopefully, after that the package no longer is in a \"bad state\", and you can upgrade. In the worst case, you may have to uninstall all the brother packages, then upgrade, and finally re-install (and re-configure) them.\nI created an installation script to ease the installation of Brother printer drivers which can be used for a clean installation -- and was successfully used for an MFC-9120CN on Ubuntu 12.4 64bit.

You need to boot the Ubuntu installation CD, and then open file manager and open your linux root partition(the one with /boot, /var, /sys, /etc, etc)(this mounts it). Close that window, but don't click the \"eject\" button next to your hard disk, unless you opened the wrong one. Now, enter, in the terminal:\ngrub-install --root-directory=<grub directory> /dev/sda\n\nwhere to get the <grub-directory> part, enter /media/and then use TAB to \"auto-complete\" the correct directory. If all goes well, when you reboot, you'll have a working GRUB system.\nAlternative method:\nObtain the Super Grub Disc(not Super grub disc 2), boot to it, pick GNU/Linux, and pick Fix boot of GNU/Linux. If all goes well, you'll be able to boot Ubuntu, where you'll be able to run update-grub from a terminal to ensure that GRUB2 is installed, and has an option for Windows.\n", "Q: Why does Ubuntu have about 2x shorter battery life than OS X on MacBook? Ubuntu 12.04 has about 2x shorter battery life than OS X on my MacBook Pro 2010. What are the technical reasons for this? Is it because OS X uses some hidden firmware features? Can Linux somehow emulate OS X power saving  behavior?\n\nA: The most likely cause is that the drivers you are using are not effectively managing power.  For example, the open source drivers for Broadcom wifi and Nvidia graphics are known to lack adequate power management.\nI managed to match the power consumption under OS X on my Macbook Air by switching to proprietary wifi and Nvidia drivers, turning off bluetooth, and using laptop-mode-tools.\n\nA: I can't give you a scientific answer all I can say is that every program that uses CPU cycles will drain the battery.\nYou could look in your logs and system statistics which also has power metric tools and figure out which processes are eating up your battery and go from there.\nAlso you could contribute ideas here http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/ideatorrent/submit/\nAlso post your findings or benchmarks.\n", "Q: How to change FAT32 sort order on drive?

The reason in fact is that I want to make my ubuntu to be used by anybody. After this guy used my ubuntu I do not want to see his garbage on my ubuntu. I want to see my ubuntu how it was looking before I gave it to him. Therefore, I have assumed that it is the best way of avoiding this problem. \nEdit:\nOkay let me clear my point. Lets assume I want to make a internet cafe-like system. Every user will be able to enter via only one user account to linux. However, I do not want them to leave anything behind. Whenever this ubuntu is booted, I want to this system remove their garbage. Why I mentioned the live USB is that I have seen that live usb or cd makes what I want but not exactly because I want to install some apps on it and make some confugration like firewall, permissions.    \nThe problem with using just the guest session is that it does not obey my rules like firewall, my limitation on the apps and so on.\n\nA: The easiest way I know of to do this is just load Ubuntu from a Virtual Box server and make it a snapshot.\nEvery time the user reboots the system all changes are gone.\nhttp://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=689982\nIt might be more involved then you like, but it works great for me.\n", "Q: Error in Oracle 11g installation in Ubuntu 12.04LTS While installing Oracle 11g in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS,it showing error as Universal Installer can not run under root.\nHow can I solve this problem??Please help me.\n\nA: Oracle installer wants to run as oracle user. So as a pre-requisite you must create the appropriate user and group:\ngroupadd -g 50000 dba\ngroupadd -g 50001 oinstall\nuseradd -u 50000 -m -d /local/oracle -g oinstall -G dba oracle\n\n(where /local/oracle is the home directory, you could also use /home/oracle instead). Having that done, you can sudo su - oracle and run the installer. Make sure all pre-requisites (kernel parameter, ulimits, etc.) are met (check with the Oracle documentation for that).\nStill, the installer may refuse to do its job when detecting no supported OS.

Next\n  select ext2fsd.sys in the C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\n  directory and then select Enable Test mode.  Complete the\n  operation by clicking \"Next\" and reboot.\n\n\nA: The easiest way is to have a separate partition using a file system understand by both, Windows and Linux, where you store all those files you want to access from both. Usually one choses to use FAT32 for this. As you did not yet setup that system (at least your question suggests so), I'd recommend creating this partition early. You could do so during the Ubuntu installation process, using the manual partitioning -- or from fdisk in Windows, prior to installing Ubuntu -- or from the Ubuntu Live CD.\n\nA: i am pretty new to this community as well and had just successfully installed ubuntu 12.10LTS on my winXP as dual boot. on my research, i might have come across something similar to what you are looking for and. based on the little info you provided (partition scheme, ubuntu version, etc), i shall try my best to present the resource that might be useful to your situation.\nfirstly, i recommend that you find out your partition scheme and type while go through some great resources online or my favourite - on youtube. in a case of information overload, article or manuals can be scanned through to familiarize yourself with the terms that you will encounter as a linux noob like i am.\nsecond, i recommend that you backup all your stuff like what many seasoned computer user always say - backup, backup and backup. there are many backup options that are available theses days and for a laymen like me there is not much security and encryption need especially while figuring out my machine a little better. free services such as CX offer free 10GB storage option while CrashPlan offers (conditional) unlimited backup which i use as i climb up the learning curve\nlastly, this particular article may demonstrate the exciting challenges that awaits and when all your data are backed up, you have not much to worry about. its unfortunate that i am not allowed to post more then 2 links due to my lack of reputation - which i found out after completed this entry which had 5 links attached :(\nanyhoo, keep on keeping on and although it is not as simple as windows, i believe that it will make me (as well as other noobs) understand computer system a little bit better and what better way (for me) to learn then to try it out in practice. it can be frustrating but you (as well as i am) are in good hand of experts here in this forum which i am very grateful for. \n", "Q: How do I get the classic file structure display in 12.04 file manager?

I understand that Zeitgeist is a passive service that logs particular events (such as opening or downloading files) for later searches, but I have large Dropbox folder that was downloaded without being logged by Zeitgeist.\nShort of manually opening and closing all files in my Dropbox folder, is there a way to have Zeitgeist index this folder so that I can later search it using the dash? Thanks!\n\nA: Actually the Dash in 12.04 is also hooked up to \"locate\". If your Dropbox folder is in your home folder it should eventually be indexed by locate. If you don't want to wait for this to happen automatically (I don't know how long that would take) you can just run \"updatedb\" in a terminal to force indexing. Note that typically the locate database is owned by root, so you need to run sudo updatedb. Now even files not covered by zeitgeist should show in the Dash. \nSource\n\nA: Zeitgeist is not an indexing service. For Dropbox transfers to appear inside Zeitgeist, the Dropbox client itself would have to tell Zeitgeist about the events. If you want all the files under there to appear in the dash search, you'll have to open them all, probably from the file manager, so that they get added to the Zeitgeist log.\n", "Q: Ubuntu 12.04 \"stuttering\" When I log in to the desktop Ubuntu seems to \"stutter\".

For example, opening the home folder I first see no effect, followed by a semi-transparent home folder, and finally the folder as it should be (this can take like 30 seconds); no animation, just three individual frames. Also, I sometimes don't see a window for a program, even though the program in question is supposed to be \"up\".\nSince this is my first experience of Linux, I confess I have no idea where to start - searching the web I only found problems with complete freezes/crashes requiring rebooting, as opposed to this \"stuttering\".\nI installed Ubuntu 12.04 32bit from a bootable USB stick a couple of days ago, right after a fresh Vista 32bit install.

I want to have them both on the start up applications. I know how to install them individualy, but I am having a rough time finding out how to get them simultaneously. I'm running Ubuntu 12.04, unity desktop environment. \n\nA: Conky without parameters looks for a file named \".conkyrc\" in your home folder. To use another config file you have to use the \"-c\" or \"--config\" parameter. This way you can start conky twice or how many times you want to, with each conky session using another config-file.\nThe included .sh-file in the archive on deviantart starts conky without parameters, so \".conkyrc\" in your home-folder will be used. => The first session\nIf you put the \"conkyrc\"-file from the archive on Gnome-look in your home-folder, you can use the command \"conky -c ~/conkyrc\". => The second session.\nBoth instances of Conky should be running, independently from each other, each with its own config-file.\n\nA: Simply add a second conky command for running a second instance of conky in the .sh file provided in the package.\nThat is just add another conky -c ~/.conkyrc under the command wrritten in .sh file\n", "Q: How can I have quick access the music controls? I'm coming back to Ubuntu and wow, a lot of things have changed since version 9. There is one thing that really annoys me.

I was wondering if there is a way to at least, just hover the volume indicator so the dropdown menu shows up and you click the next song arrow.\nMaybe there are other ways to change songs quickly?\n\nA: There isn't a way to change behavior of the indicator, but you can use multimedia keys on your keyboard. If you don't have next/previous track buttons on your keyboard, you can bind other keys in the Keyboard System Settings. My keyboard only has volume up/down/mute buttons, but I have bound them to the next/prev/play buttons instead, as I don't use software volume control really. You can also keep both functions and use Ctrl+VolumeUp to mean next track, for example.

Windows asks me to reformat every time I plug it into my computer, so I fired up Ubuntu via VirtualBox (selecting the external hard drive in the USB settings for VirtualBox beforehand) to see if I can access it there.\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for me? I have over 1TB of data on this drive and do not want to lose it. When I plug it into an electrical outlet, the light turns on, and when I plug it into my laptop, I can feel it clicking.\n\nA: In case the drive holds important data that need to be rescued:\n\nStop using the drive\n\nAny drive access will further worsen the hardware defects and thus decrease the likelihood of being able to recover data. If the data are vital we should let professionals do the job.\nHaving said this, we can try to rescue the drive content from an image copy of the data that in the best case we have obtained with a last read access e.g. with ddrescue. This should not be done from a virtual machine (boot a live system instead). See also the following questions and answers here:\nHow to recover data from a failing hard drive?\nExternal hard drive failing, is backup recovery possible?\nRecover files from NTFS drive with bad sectors\n\nA: \nI can feel movement within the drive (it is a repetitive movement that continues for as long as the drive is plugged into the laptop via USB).\n\nThe repetitive movement you can feel is most probably the \"click of death\". The drive is effectively dead.\nJust because fdisk can see the MBR (first 64 bytes -- of a 2 TB drive!) doesn't mean you will be able to mount it successfully, or get any data off of it. sdb1 is the NTFS partition you're looking for, but ntfs-3g is already telling you it can't read the NTFS signature (a preliminary step to mounting the drive).\nI don't understand what you are attempting to do with sudo more /dev/sdb1?\nYou can try some \"folklore\" fixes that may or may not work, e.g. freezing the drive inside a ziploc bag for 24 hours to see if that temporarily fixes the problem, etc., but you should probably start resigning yourself to the fact that the data is most likely lost.\n", "Q: How can I install Inkscape from BZR?

More details on that here and here.\n\nI just did a quick search on Launchpad, and discovered this PPA, which appears to have daily builds of inkscape available. Instructions on how to add the PPA are available here, the PPA you want to add is ppa:cafuego/inkscape.\n\nA: First install the build dependencies, you can do this simply by asking apt for the dependencies, first you need to make sure the source code section of software sources is set up:\n\n\n*\n\n*How do I enable the source code repositories?\nThen install the dependencies:\nsudo apt-get build-dep inkscape\n\nThen you want to pull the source, in this case we don' t need the entire history for the project so we'll just do a lightweight checkout, this can still take a while:\nbzr co --lightweight lp:inkscape\n\nThen we need to cd into the directory and build it\ncd inkscape\n./autogen.sh\n./configure\nmake\nsudo make install\n\nThis will build Inkscape and install it into /usr/local/bin/inkscape by default. \n", "Q: Philips GoGear detected by Rhythmbox but not Banshee I got a Philips GoGear Vibe and wanted to use it in Ubuntu 12.04. I was also using Banshee instead of Rhythmbox, and wanted to keep doing that. The problem is that Banshee doesn't detect the device, while Rhythmbox does. However, Rhythmbox crashes when I try to put music on the device... so I got to use Clementine, which works with my device but doesn't work with the music lens.\nSo... is there a way for me to make Banshee work with that device?\n\nA: *\n\n*Set your player to MTP mode and attach it to your computer with the included USB cable.\n\n*Open the file browser and then click on the icon for your player (mine says Philips). \n\n*Once your in the window inside your player hit control h (Ctrl+H) (hold the control button and press the \"H\" key) to show your hidden files.\n\n*Right click in the window and select the \"Create Document -> Empty File\" option.\n\n*Name the file: .is_audio_player\n\n*Now open the file and paste the following text in it:\naudio_folders=Music/,Recordings/\nvideo_folders=Video/\noutput_formats=audio/flac,audio/mpeg\n\nThese are a list of directories for the programs to put your music into and a list of the file formats your player supports. I have only included flac and mp3, but you can add others by looking up the mime type syntax (ex wma = audio/x-ms-wma etc).\n\n*When you're done, save your file and eject your player. \n\n*Let your player update and then plug it back in to your computer.\n\n*Open Banshee or Rythmbox and you should see your player mount.\n\nA: I also was getting same error. I did some research, and lots of tinkering...\nCreating the \".is_audio_player\" file AND changing the setting on my device to \"MSC\" transfer mode (saw that in another post someplace) seems to have done the trick!

I am not yet fully versed with the components installed by default on my machine, so I will apologize in advance if my question is silly.  shows that a lot many of (what I assume are) KDE components (libk*, kde*, etc.) are being installed/updated on my machine. That is just the output from sudo apt-fast update && sudo apt-fast dist-upgrade -y from a few minutes ago.\n\n\n*\n\n*Can anyone tell me why?\n\n*Can I safely remove them? If yes, how?\n\n\nThanks in advance for any replies.\nSystem specs: Fully updated Ubuntu 12.04 x86_64 w/kernel3.4, Gnome, Unity, Core2Duo, 4GB\n\nA: You probably installed a KDE app at some time in the past, which needed to pull in those libraries to run.  \nThe KDE apps would be shown in either synaptic or the Software Center, and if you're not careful, you could easily install one without realizing it.\nEdit: How to remove KDE components\nI don't know if there is one command that will work, but according to this topic, you may be able to run sudo apt-get remove kdebase-bin.\nAlso, in synaptic, you can search all installed packages and filter on \"KDE\" to get a list of any installed packages that mention KDE, but it would need to be checked to make sure it's not just a Gnome program that says something such as \"like the KDE program\", for example.  But it's a graphical way to see and select installed KDE components.\nThere are also long commandlines that can be copied and pasted to delete everything KDE, such as the ones on this site.\n\nA: You should first figure out what is pulling those packages in. You can do so from the command line for each of the packages. Giving one example:\napt-cache rdepends kdoctools\n\nshould list all packages requiring the kdoctool package (\"rdepends\" = \"reverse depends\"), but regardless whether they are installed or not. So for each \"reverse dependency\" listed, you can then check whether it is installed, using dpkg:\ndpkg -l <packagename>\n\nIf dpkg cannot find that packagename, it never has been installed. If the output line starts with \"ii\", the package is installed (and you should not remove kdoctools in this example). In all other cases, the package is not installed either (\"un\" e.g. means \"uninstalled\").\nYou could also check with apt-get's autoremove parameter, e.g.\napt-get autoremove --purge\n\nThis would try to remove dependencies which were once pulled in but are no longer needed, and purge relevant configuration files (you can ommit the --purge if you're afraid of that part).\n\nA: Most likely you did install some package that needs this KDE packages. \nYou can remove them but carefully look on what gets removed due to the dependencies.\n", "Q: Can't see anything I type except on internet, can't download anything, can't even open software center. If I do anything with sudo terminal says:\nE: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.\n\nThis all started after i canceled the 11 upgrade during the download process\n\nA: Open a terminal, or press Ctrl-Alt-F1 (press Ctrl-Alt-F7 to get back into XWindows), then type in:\nsudo dpkg --configure -a\n\nIf you have further problems, then you may wish to start a new question.\n", "Q: How do I convert my Ubuntu installation into a Live-USB or Live-CD? Say I have Ubuntu installed in a hard drive\nWhat can I do to generate a liveUSB that is as similar as possible to the installation ? \n\nA: I recommend using Remastersys.\nThis will create a hardware-independent LiveCD ISO backup of your system; you can then use a tool such as Unetbootin to \"burn\" the ISO to a USB and create a LiveUSB.\nRemastersys includes both command-line and GUI front-ends. Note that the author recommends starting with a \"clean\" install and then customizing it to maintain the highest compatibility for the LiveCD/LiveUSB. There is also a 4GB final size limitation, which means that your Ubuntu install should be around 8GB at most, and you should not include any media files, deb files, etc.\n", "Q: How do I enable the source code repositories? I need to install build-dependencies of something, how do I ensure the source code section of my software sources is enabled?\n\nA: Launch the software center and select software sources:\n\nIn the software sources make sure \"Source Code\" is checked:\n\n\nA: The default archive repositories have the source archives enabled as well as the binaries. Also, adding any PPAs with sudo add-apt-repository ppa:user/archive should enable the source and binary archives both.\nTo verify, you can check in the /etc/apt/sources.list file, and in the files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/, to ensure the deb-src lines for each deb archive line, are there. Also, in the Software Sources properties dialog, you can check that the Source code option is checked on the Ubuntu Software tab, and that there are corresponding Source entries for the Binaries entries, in the list of additional sources under the Other Software tab.\n\nA: You can enable source code repositories by uncommenting (removing #'s) deb-src repositories from /etc/apt/sources.list.\nsed -i '/deb-src/s/^# //' /etc/apt/sources.list && apt update\n\nIf you want to disable source code repositories, you can comment it back\nsed -i '/deb-src/s/^/# /' /etc/apt/sources.list && apt update\n\n", "Q: How can I easily set up a Google Cloud Print printer?

This is a very strange problem! I am using HP dv6000 laptop with Ubuntu 12.04. Since last few days if I open certain websites in Chrome (e.g. Gmail, Youtube, etc.) the mute button led keeps blinking with \"tick tick\" sound.\nI am using Chrome Version 20.0.1132.47\nUPDATE:\nI noticed if I disable the flash plugin in Chrome and then open those sites the problem does not appear.\nUPDATE 2:\nAlso, if battery left is less than 80% AND it is not connected to power AND some certain websites are open the problem appears.\nAny idea I could get rid of this annoying problem?\n\nA: It blinks every time any sound is playing, so when you visit a website that plays sounds it blinks.. (obviously the flash sites are those with more sounds interactions).\nIt's not a problem but a simply function that will advert you when you are in \"mute-mode\" and a sound is playing in the background. \nI hope it will help!\n\nA: I wonder if this might be the solution:\nLenovo Z560 volume mute/unmute button always blinks while on battery. How do I stop that?\nTake a look at the answer posted there (I noticed you commented that you were having the same problem, and I note that this question specifically mentions Chrome and flash)\nShort answer:  it might have to do with the Pepper-based Flash built into Chrome.  Try disabling the Pepper-based Flash and use only the normal Flash and see if the blinking continues.  I had a similar problem and disabling the Pepper-flash solved my issue.  (Note that my mute light still goes to solid \"on\" when sound is playing, but then it goes to solid \"off\" when the sound stops.  It doesn't blink anymore.\nFor a longer answer, check the thread posted above.\n\nA: Mine was fixed by pressing the mute button for 10 to 15 seconds while the power was cut down.\nReason: I think it might have been a static problem with button mechanics.\n", "Q: Why does my screen get random color lines and freeze with ANY operating system?

TBH, rarely do people use DVD for installing Ubuntu. Most of them these days use USB. It's also lot faster and flexible installation that way. \nYou have to download the ISO file of the Ubuntu and then make a bootable USB drive.\nThere are tutorials on how to do it here:\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick/\n\n*How do install Ubuntu from a USB stick?\n\n*http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-install-ubuntu-linux-from-usb-stick.html\nNow, you have the option to dual boot along with Vista or remove it completely while you install Ubuntu.

So what you need to do is to install unetbootin in your computer (in Windows Vista). I am assuming that you already have a pendrive and you have downloaded an ISO image of latest Ubuntu 12.04, if not do that. Once done all you need to do is to run unetbootin, plug-in a pendrive and then start making a bootable USB/pendrive.\nNow one more thing, if you are switching completely from Windows to Ubuntu, first thing I will recommend you to is get backup of all your important stuff. Because everything is going to be formatted. So get the backup then restart your computer, press F2 or F12 ( or whatever brings the boot menu), then reorder the bootmenu so that your pendrive boots ahead of your hard disk. It will give you the Ubuntu install screen and everything is a cakewalk after that. Still i would recommend you to get familiar with the install process looking at the screenshots provided at numerous guides across internet. You need to search like installation screenshots for Ubuntu 12.04 on Google and you will get all you need.\nOne heads up: Do look at the net configuration guides as well.

When I run\nhostname -d\n\nI get an empty string\n\nA: ​I use domain names to bind my shared storage to my user group TIGERGROUP.  This method allows for the domain name TIGERGROUP to be used as a CIFS share. Think of TIGERGROUP domain name as WORKGROUP domain in windows.

Run it with the name passed as the first argument for that :\nhostname www.example.com\n\nThis is only effective till a reboot, though. You can edit /etc/hostname for permanent changes.\nFor changing domainnames, the man page recommends the following :\n\nNote, that only the super-user can change the names.\nIt  is  not  possible  to  set the FQDN or the DNS domain name with the dnsdomainname command (see THE FQDN below).\nThe  host  name  is   usually   set   once   at   system   startup   in /etc/init.d/hostname.sh  (normally  by  reading  the contents of a file which contains the host name, e.g.  /etc/hostname).\nUsually you can set it in /etc/hosts\n\n\nA: Put it in /etc/hostname.\nFor example, my machine is called hubble, so in my /etc/hostname I have:\nashton@hubble:~$ cat /etc/hostname\nhubble.mydomain.blah.blah\n\nYou might need to reboot to get it to show up when you run uname though.\n\nA: Edit /etc/hostname and add your unqualified hostname:\nboson\nEdit /etc/hosts:\nsudo vi /etc/hosts\nAdd an entry of your desired hostname by replacing boson.dev.local boson where boson.dev.local is the fully qualified hostname and boson is hostname.\n127.0.1.1       boson.dev.local boson\nRestart the hostname service:\nsudo service hostname restart\n\nTest your configuration by opening a terminal and enter the below commands:\n\n\n*\n\n*hostname\n\n*\n\n*This should output boson\n\n\n*hostname -f\n\n*\n\n*This should output boson.dev.local\nHope this helps.\n\nA: Fine!

Some fd's are end up with w.\n\nA: \nThat means these process can reach the same memory space.\n\nWhy would they want to reach a common memory space? The answer's simple -- to talk to each other!\nIn your case, dropbox is talking to gnome-panel, which provides the Dropbox status icon.\nThe libc manual has this to say:\n\nThe major use of duplicating a file descriptor is to implement redirection of input or output: that is, to change the file or pipe that a particular file descriptor corresponds to. \n\nThe u flag simply means that the FD is read-write; w means write-only, r means read-only.\n\nA: File descriptors are defined in a per process namespace.

On one particular machine I often need to run sudo commands every now and then.\nI am fine with entering password on sudo in most of the cases.\nHowever there are three sudo commands I want to run without entering password:\n\n\n*\n\n*sudo reboot\n\n*sudo shutdown -r now\n\n*sudo shutdown -P now\nHow can I exclude these commands from password protection to sudo?\n\nA: Use the NOPASSWD directive\nYou can use the NOPASSWD directive in your /etc/sudoers file.\nIf your user is called user and your host is called host you could add these lines to /etc/sudoers:\nuser host = (root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown\nuser host = (root) NOPASSWD: /sbin/reboot\n\nThis will allow the user user to run the desired commands on host without entering a password. All other sudoed commands will still require a password.\nThe commands specified in the sudoers file must be fully qualified (i.e. using the absolute path to the command to run) as described in the sudoers man page. Providing a relative path is considered a syntax error.\nIf the command ends with a trailing / character and points to a directory, the user will be able to run any command in that directory (but not in any sub-directories therein). In the following example, the user user can run any command in the directory /home/someuser/bin/:\nuser host = (root) NOPASSWD: /home/someuser/bin/\n\nNote: Always use the command visudo to edit the sudoers file to make sure you do not lock yourself out of the system – just in case you accidentally write something incorrect to the sudoers file. visudo will save your modified file to a temporary location and will only overwrite the real sudoers file if the modified file can be parsed without errors.\nUsing /etc/sudoers.d instead of modifying /etc/sudoers\nAs an alternative to editing the /etc/sudoers file, you could add the two lines to a new file in /etc/sudoers.d e.g. /etc/sudoers.d/shutdown. This is an elegant way of separating different changes to the sudo rights and also leaves the original sudoers file untouched for easier upgrades.\nNote: Again, you should use the command visudo to edit the file to make sure you do not lock yourself out of the system:\nsudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/shutdown \n\nThis also automatically ensures that the owner and permissions of the new file is set correctly.\nIf sudoers is messed up\nIf you did not use visudo to edit your files and then accidentally messed up /etc/sudoers or messed up a file in /etc/sudoers.d then you will be locked out of sudo.\nThe solution could be to fix the files using pkexec which is an alternative to sudo.\nTo fix /etc/sudoers:\npkexec visudo\n\nTo fix /etc/sudoers.d/shutdown:\npkexec visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/shutdown\n\nIf the ownership and/or permissions are incorrect for any sudoers file, the file will be ignored by sudo so you might also find yourself locked out in this situation. Again, you can use pkexec to fix this.\nThe correct permissions should be like this:\n$ ls -l /etc/sudoers.d/shutdown \n-r--r----- 1 root root 86 Jul 16 15:37 /etc/sudoers.d/shutdown\n\nUse pkexec like this to fix ownership and permissions:\npkexec chown root:root /etc/sudoers.d/shutdown\npkexec chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/shutdown\n\n\nA: Sorry but there's so much confusion over this and some really complicated answers, that i feel i must weigh in here before someone misunderstands and does something crazy.\nUsing visudo!!\nvisudo\n\nAdd the following lines to the config:\nALL ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/reboot,/sbin/shutdown\n\nThis allows the commands, reboot and shutdown with any parameters to be executed from any user. The first \"ALL\" refers to the users, so it means ALL users. The second ALL refers to ALL hosts.\nFor a more verbose explanation see man sudoers as this provides further examples and these examples are several pages down but they are actually there if you dig deep enough.\nPlease stackexchange, just give simple, succinct answers.\n\nA: The answer mentioning to set a host confused me, as I want to be able to have a sudo user be able to run privileged commands without requiring to consider such \"host aspect\"; any host should work, hence I use the special ALL reserved word.\nLet's assume you want all sudo users (i.e., Unix users which are members of the Unix group sudo) to run the following commands as superuser (root) without having to enter their passwords:\n\n*\n\n*sudo iftop\n\n*sudo dbus-monitor --system\nFirst find out the executable's full path using which:\n\n*\n\n*which iftop > /usr/sbin/iftop\n\n*which dbus-monitor > /usr/bin/dbus-monitor\nAssuming the main sudo configuration file etc/sudoers contains the following directive (an Ubuntu default) ...\n#includedir /etc/sudoers.d\n\n... then it is a best practice to add your configuration in its own separate file within the /etc/sudoers.d/ directory, e.g. /etc/sudoers.d/customizations. This way, you will not run into problems when an update to the original sudo package wants to change the original /etc/sudoers file and the package manager notices conflicting edits done by you.\nRun the following command to create and edit your own sudo customization file:\nsudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/customizations\n\nUsing the visudo command makes sure that there are no syntax erros in the file when saving it - syntax errors would otherwise make sudo fail to read all its configuration files, thereby breaking any subsequent sudo usage, effectively locking you out from any superuser usage, including fixing the syntax erros.\nNow add the following lines to this file and save it:\n%sudo ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/iftop\n%sudo ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/dbus-monitor --system\n\nThe %sudo at the beginning of these lines indicate they are rules for all members of group (\"%\") sudo.\nChanges to sudo configuration files, including new files within the /etc/sudoers.d/ directory, take effect immediately - no sudo \"restart\" required.\nNow notice what happens when running the following commands: (for testing purposes, any current sudo ticket, i.e. the timespan without requiring to reenter the password, can be directly revoked/timed-out by executing sudo -k)\n\n*\n\n*iftop: fails with You don't have permission to capture on that device (socket: Operation not permitted). This is because running the configured commands without the sudo prefix behave unprivileged as usual.\n\n*sudo iftop: this command will now run successfully without requiring a password.\n\n*sudo iftop -B (\"display bandwidth in bytes\"): this command will also run successfully without requiring a password, because, as man sudoers explains, \"a simple file name [without parameters, in the configuration file] allows the user to run the command with any arguments they wish.\"\n\n*sudo dbus-monitor: the system will ask for password, because, as man sudoers explains, \"if a [command, in the configuration file] has associated command line arguments, then the arguments in the [command] must match exactly those given by the user on the command line (or match the wildcards if there are any).\"\n\n*sudo dbus-monitor --system: this command will now run successfully without requiring a password.\n\n*sudo dbus-monitor --system --foo: the system will ask for password, as the arguments don't match the configuration.\n\nComing back to the initial question, for all users in the sudo group to be allowed to run the following commands without asking for their passwords ...\nsudo reboot\nsudo shutdown -r now\nsudo shutdown -P now\n\n... create a sudo configuration file with the following content (assuming Ubuntu standard locations for the executables reboot and shutdown):\n%sudo ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/reboot\n%sudo ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/shutdown -r now\n%sudo ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/shutdown -P now\n\nNotice with this configuration, any sudo user can now also run sudo reboot ... with any arguments, flags, and parameters without having to provide a password, including e.g. sudo reboot --poweroff --force.\nIf this is not desired, but instead only sudo reboot without any arguments/flags/parameters shall be allowed, its configuration line has to be changed to ...\n%sudo ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/reboot \"\"\n\n... because as man sudoers explains: \"you can specify \"\" to indicate that the command may only be run without command line arguments.\"\n", "Q: How to add startup applications in lubuntu?

I tried to apply this method http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3121 but after creating the script there, I was unable to edit the /etc/inittab file as there is not one present. Apparently this is because Ubuntu does not use this method and instead uses 'upstart'. Is there a similar way to auto login with Ubuntu??\n\nA: According to the fine manual, you need to edit /etc/gdm/custom.conf in 10.04. If you can live with a GUI solution, then:\n\n\n*\n\n*Load the Gnome Administration utility by clicking on System -> Administration -> Login Screen Settings\n\n*Unlock the window by hitting the unlock button (you will be asked the administrator password)\n\n*Enable the checkbox for Log in as UserName automatically (Select your User Name from the drop-down list of users)\n\n", "Q: Disk Space on Home partition shrinks from 5.5GB to 0 after each restart My disk space \"vanishes\" after in a couple minutes after strating my system.

What is happening and why?\n\nA: If the above does not help (as it did for me), try\nsudo diskutil umountDisk /dev/diskN\n\nThat did the trick for me. \n\nA: If you clicked the little eject icon in the Finder, this will unmount and eject the usb drive, which will give the error you saw.  You want to umount only.\nUnmounting can be done in Apple's Disk Utility using the Unmount button (in toolbar next to Eject), or it can be done as Marcel answers below from the commandline.\nsudo diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN\n\n\nA: If the disk is still mounted, you'll get a 'resource busy' error. If it's been ejected, you'll get the 'Operation not supported' error. You need to go into disk utility and UNMOUNT the partitions on the drive but do not EJECT the destination drive.

The commands we need are the following:\n\n*\n\n*pacmd list-cards\nwill list the cards available. As soon as a headset is connected we will have access to the Bluetooth audio properties. In addition we can now find out the pulseaudio card index, and possible profiles for the following commands.\n\n\n*pacmd set-card-profile <index> <profile>\nchanges the profile for a card number <index>. For a Bluetooth card the profile in question will be a2dp for audio profile, and hsp for headset telephony profile.\n\n\n*pacmd set-default-sink and pacmd set-default-source\nwill change the output resp. input used by pulseaudio. This can not be done during playback. See this answer for details on how to do that.\nBelow there is an example script that may be used to switch the sound output for a Bluetooth headset:\n#!/bin/bash\n# CLI options:  `a2dp': Audio Profile\n#               `hsp':  Telephony Profile\n#               <Index> Default Sink (try `0' or `1')\n\nSINK=$( pacmd list-cards | grep -B 1 bluez )\nINDEX=${SINK:10:2}\nSINK=$( pacmd list-cards | grep bluez )\nMAC=${SINK:19:17}\nBT_SINK=\"bluez_sink.$MAC\"\nBT_SOURCE=\"bluez_source.$MAC\"\n\nif [ $1 = a2dp ]; then\n    echo Setting A2DP audio sink $BT_SINK\n    pacmd set-card-profile $INDEX a2dp\n    pacmd set-default-sink $BT_SINK\nelif [ $1 = hsp ]; then\n    echo Setting HSP headset sink $BT_SOURCE\n    pacmd set-card-profile $INDEX hsp\n    pacmd set-default-sink $BT_SINK\n    pacmd set-default-source $BT_SOURCE\nelse\n    echo Resetting to internal audio\n    pacmd set-default-sink $1\n    pacmd set-default-source $1\nfi\n\nCopy the script, save it as switch-sink, and grant it executable permission.

This may become an issue as the card INDEX will be increased with every power ON or reconnect of a Bluetooth device.

I am not in a position to buy new RAM / CPU / motherboard and the old one is probably too old to replace (I was running a Core 2 Duo on Gigabyte EP-35). \nI am thinking I can get by with just my laptop for a few months, but I do need access to the data on the hard drives which were in the desktop machine.  It is a pair of WD green 3.5\" sata drives, one 2TB and one 3TB.  I want to avoid having to reformat the drives if at all possible.  \n\nA: Qnap is renowned for its good quality NAS. Synology is considered a good alternative. Usually all these NAS have linux inside. At the very least they support samba sharing (but they usually support a vast plethora of protocols) so you shouldn't have any problem accessing them from Ubuntu.\nYou just have to check the specs about ext4 file system. Older or very entry level NAS might not support that.\nLooking at Qnap entry level 2-bays product I can say they support ext4. The same goes for the Synology counterpart.\nWhich one to pick mostly depends on your budget. Don't worry too much about Ubuntu compatibility (99% of them support Linux), just make sure -looking at the specs- that ext4 is supported.\nAlso, if you take a 2-bay NAS to access both drives at the same time, remember NOT to set any RAID between them. You want to access them individually. Once you have backed everything up you might consider setting up a RAID (not advisable with drives of different size though).\n\nA: Why are you going with a nas? Get a cheapie sata -> usb dock (for easy swapping between the drives) and attach it to your laptop.  \n", "Q: How can I update Ubuntu if the update servers are blocked? I connect to the Internet through my college wifi and for some weird reason they have blocked all Ubuntu updates, so I cannot update Ubuntu through the common \"Update Manager\" way.\nSo I was wondering if there was some other method to update Ubuntu, maybe manually download each package and then install them or download a DVD image which already has all the packages.\nI have Ubuntu 11.10 installed currently.\n\nA: Ubuntu uses HTTP to update, which is the same protocol used to access most websites (including Ask Ubuntu). Therefore, it seems likely that the particular server you're trying to upgrade from is blocked or (perhaps more likely) otherwise inaccessible due to network problems.\nIf this is the case, then updating normally with the Update Manager could succeed, if you change your mirror.\nYou can do this in the Ubuntu Software tab of the Software Sources window. Change the selection in the Download from drop-down menu.\n\nOne way to open the Software Sources window is by clicking Settings... in the Update Manager.\n\nA: There are ways that involve manually downloading packages, but an easier solution might be to switch to a different mirror.\nUbuntu's updates are 'mirrored' onto a number of different servers around the world. So whilst http://archive.ubuntu.com/ is not accessible to you, there is likely to be a mirror with a URL that you can access.\nFor an easy way of selecting a fast mirror, look at this Ask Ubuntu answer.\n\nA: You can use a cd with the new version of Ubuntu and use it to do the update.\nThere is also an application called \"AptOnCD\" that you can use to preform the update.\nI hope this can help you.\n\nA: I realise there is no good answer to my question because in the end I'll have to download \"from the internet\" and I believe all downloads have been blocked currently so it really doesn't matter whether I'm trying to download each package manually or using the download manager or whatever. I guess I'll just have to wait until the block has been lifted.\n", "Q: Why can python3 not import gi.repository?

I do not have a PATH specified, and I use absolute paths to call all my scheduled scripts, setting the PATH in them as needed. I do not specify a SHELL in the crontab. All scripts identify the shell as their first line.\nWithout me touching the system, a particular job defined in the middle of other jobs will suddenly stop running.\nTo debug this, I added an output redirection to a log file. In that, the output clearly shows the output of the script successfully running time after time for weeks, and then suddenly the following appears:\n/bin/sh: /home/iupress/bin/sync-email_images: not found\n/bin/sh: /home/iupress/bin/sync-email_images: not found\n/bin/sh: /home/iupress/bin/sync-email_images: not found\n/bin/sh: /home/iupress/bin/sync-email_images: not found\n/bin/sh: /home/iupress/bin/sync-email_images: not found\n/bin/sh: /home/iupress/bin/sync-email_images: not found\n/bin/sh: /home/iupress/bin/sync-email_images: not found\n/bin/sh: /home/iupress/bin/sync-email_images: not found\n/bin/sh: /home/iupress/bin/sync-email_images: not found\n\nIf I do the ls command, copying and pasting that exact path from the error message, it clearly reports the file is still there (no surprise). Yet the log continues to report that file is \"not found\" until I take action.\nI can run the script manually and it runs just fine. \nIf I do sudo crontab -e and save the file, the job runs on the next scheduled time, putting its output in the log, no longer reporting the script is \"not found\".\nIt seems to me the contents of the script trying to be run are irrelevant since cron doesn't even process the file because it is \"not found\".\nI have a job scheduled below the one that is encountering this problem that I know is continuing to run, because I have its output mailed to me. So I know cron is running and continues to run at least one other job, even after it suddenly reports this job's script is \"not found\". \nAll my lines end with a newline. I had no periods in the crontab until I added the redirection to a log file. I have now added a PATH specification, but left the absolute paths in the jobs. Unfortunately, I have no idea if and when this problem will occur. It will likely be weeks from now.\nBy the way, I am running a script to syncronize the clock, and I see the time is exactly what it should be.\n\nA: Not entirely sure if this will be of any help. But restarting your cron may/or may not help. \nsudo service cron restart \n\n", "Q: disk space wrongly displayed after installing LVM disk I installed ubuntu server using LVM partitioning on a 1 TB hard disk.

You can use pvs to see how much space lvm has allocated to volumes, and how much it has left, and lvextend to increase the size of a logical volume ( does not need to be unmounted ).  After increasing the size of the logical volume, you will need to tell the fs to use the new space.  Assuming you are using ext[234], you can do this with resize2fs, which also can expand without unmounting.\nsudo lvextend -L 20g system/root\nsudo resize2fs /dev/mapper/system-root\n\nNote that expanding the volume to use ALL of the unallocated space may not be such a great idea, since you won't have any left to add new volumes later, should you choose to do so, or make use of lvm snapshots.  You can reduce the size of the volume later to free up some space, but that requires the fs to be unmounted, thus you will need to boot the server from some other medium.\n\nA: In all seriousness, have you rebooted? This will cause the filesystem to recalculate how big it should be. There is a command to do this live, but I can't remember what it is right now.\n", "Q: How to revert packages at their previous state? I've set all of my \"manually installed\" packages as \"automatic installed\". \nNow apt-get is saying several packages are not needed, and it suggests to use apt-get autoremove to get rid of them. Of course I want to mantain such packages and get rid of the message, so I suppose I need to revert them back to their previous status of manually installed.\nI can't do it one by one, because they're too many. \nHow could I do?\n\nA: Simply do an apt-get install <packagename> for each of the affected packages. They will then no longer be recommended to \"autoremove\".\nKeep in mind: \"automatic installed\" means you didn't explicitly request them, but they have been drawn-in by dependencies (some other package declared it needed them). So if there's no longer a package which needs it, and you never wanted it in the first place, apt considers it as \"obsolete\".\n", "Q: Why won't fetchmail work all of a sudden?

I tried 'file' but from the looks of it, all of MSOffice files are categorized under the same file type. Similarly I'm having trouble with docx, xlsx and pptx files, since they're essentially all zip files containing a bunch of xml.\nI also tried a python script importing the magic module, but no go. \nI'm trying to identify the actual file for a sandbox analysis. And for this specific purpose I need to find the actual file type in order to run it in the sandbox vm (the Windows vm runs everything by extension).\nLet's say my sample file is labeled as try.exe, but in reality it's just a doc file. My script will rename it as try.exe.doc, which would work fine for doc files. But since linux identifies all MSOffice files as simple DOC files then there's no way to identify ppt or xls files. As a result the sandbox wont' analyze the sample correctly. \n\nA: Use file with -i to get mime-type:\nfile -i <filename>\n\n\nA: You can use mimetype command. Example:\nmimetype example.ppt\nexample.ppt: application/vnd.ms-powerpoint\n\nand \nmimetype example.doc \nexample.doc: application/vnd.ms-word\n\nHowever, unlike file -i this MIME-type determination is based on looking-up file extensions (.ppt, .doc etc.) from the shared MIME-info database and changing them will change the MIME-types, too. \nWith extension altered, the only way to know about a file is to look into its file-signature or magic number, which is same for all Microsoft Office documents(D0 CF 11 E0 or DOCFILE0). So any MS-Office files will be detected as same MIME-type.\n", "Q: How do I know the password for my encrypted home directory? \nPossible Duplicate:\nEncrypted Home… Forgotten Password, but no Passphrase \n\nI encrypted my Home to protect against hackers of course when I first installed Ubuntu.

HELP!!!\nDoes anyone remember the command for Terminal to give you you're randomly generated Encryption password pop up on the famous purple window?\n\nA: It looks as if you are trying to install java, which (I presume it wants root access) needs an administrator's logon password, not the encryption key. Just give it the password you use to log on to Ubuntu. In fact, it is using sudo(or some GUI spinoff, like kdesudo, or gksudo) which uses the admin logon password to get rights to do anything under the system under the root account.\nReference: http://linux.die.net/man/8/sudo\nEdit: Also, if it actually needs the encryption key, feel free to run:\necryptfs-unwrap-passphrase\n\nupon the terminal to get the long hex string you need.\n", "Q: What happened to tortoisehg-nautilus in 12.04?

Changing /etc/fstab as indicated in the same post gives me an error. Please help.\nIs there any other way of rectifying this problem?\n\nA: Install NTFS configuration tool and when you open it for first time you will get an option to enable write support on NTFS partitions you have - internal or external.\nYou can also select which partitions you want to enable support by default. \nFor example, I have three NTFS partitions - one of which is Windows 7 C: drive and one other is Windows 7 boot loader partition. I enabled write support only for C: drive and not the bootloader by default. Doing this will also auto-mount the partitions for you (by the time Ubuntu boots up). You don't need to mount them each time, if you use this tool.\nGo to Software Center and search for NTFS and you will find this one in the list. Just install it and open it, you will understand what to do. I use Gparted too, but I don't think that the problem is with Gparted or something else. NTFS partitions give some trouble sometimes.\nRead these for more explanation if the software center doesn't show NTFS tool in its repositories (which I think might be the case with 11.10):\nHow do I enable NTFS write support?\nAdding NTFS-Write capability by default\n\nA: Try uninstalling GParted. Also, try to remember what you did to NTFS partitions using GParted and reverse those actions if possible. I had a configuration quite similar to yours (11.10, GParted installed, and an NTFS partition auto mounted via pysdm).

I've recently started using xbmc and i love it. The only thing is i cant find a way of setting it as the default media player. \nIt just does not show up on the default list. I hope someone out there help on this.\n\nA: xbmc is a media center not a media player.\nYou must start xbmc first to open a file with-in\nI agree it is a great media center probebly the best but i would use Mplayer if you  want to just click on files to open them\n\nA: This will add a new menu entry via a desktop file, XBMC-sendto, which will open XBMC or give it focus and open the media file. It works with audio, video and picture files that are local or on network shares (I've only tested with smb shares). This requires the program wmctrl to be installed and JSON-RPC (the webserver) to be enabled in XBMC/KODI.\nThe zip file contains two files. The kde-send-to-xbmc.sh file can be placed anywhere you like (don't forget to make it executable) and the xbmc-send2.desktop file needs to be placed in ~/.local/share/applications/. Then edit xbmc-send2.desktop and update the Exec= line to reflect where you put the sh file. If json-rpc uses a non-standard port or you want to send content to a remote xbmc host you need to edit kde-send-to-xbmc.sh. You may need to restart you desktop environment, although this was not necessary in KDE4. Now you will be able to open media files with XBMC directly from the desktop (you'll probably need to set XBMC-sendto as the default program for a particular file type).\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/22410524/xbmc/xbmc-file-associations-0.0.1.zip\nI have only tested this with KDE, I would like to hear if it works (or doesnt) with other DE's.

A lot of the games I like to play don't run too well on my Xubuntu laptop, so I decided that I was going to play Icewind Dale.  I installed it, but when I go to play, 2/3 of the graphics is off the top of the screen.  Apparently, Icewind Dale has a windowed mode, but I don't know how to enable it out of the screen, so now I'm just kind of stuck.  I'm running Wine 1.5.5.  Anyone know of any solutions?\n\nA: There are definitely some things that might be helpful for you regarding Icewind Dale in wine:\n1) If the windowed mode in your game is not available in the options, you can run wine in windowed mode via the 'virtual desktop' setting (see further below). However, before you alter the wine setting, you must also enable windowed mode by running the Icewind Dale config tool in the Icewind Dale game folder in your .wine prefix.\n \nNow, go to Wine configuration in the Xubuntu Wine menu, go to Applications and select your Icewind Dale executable and create a profile for it; in that application profile you can have custom settings for audio, graphics,etc (i.e. all the settings tabs that are available). In the graphics section you can set a 'windowed' mode via the 'virtual desktop' setting; just set the resolution, as the screenshot below shows, and save your settings.\n\n2) Another possibility is that you could run Icewind Dale in GemRB, which is a native SDL port of the Infinity Engine, which Icewind Dale uses. You could use your existing game files, and install further infinity engine games with wine, and then point gemrb to the files, as noted here. There is also a gemrb launcher that may be useful. It is possible to successfully play through Icewind Dale 1, but not the expansions. This is definitely a possibility for you and any fans of the Infinity Engine games. Further details on how well the games are supported is noted here, and the Baldur's Gate series run particularly well in gemRB. \nIcewind Dale running in windowed mode with wine.\n\n", "Q: Resize/Create a New Partition in GParted So I've been having some trouble recently with Ubuntu and decided it was time to switch to windows.

After installing Ubuntu I found the helpful WubiGuide that informed me that RAID configurations are not supported by this Wubi installation of Ubuntu.

Windows still boots without trouble.\nThe size of the root.disk file is 0, but it exists.  I'm not sure if that's normal or if it was corrupted or what... but based on the guide I used the windows command chkdsk /R to check my disk.  It found many errors, but it didn't produce a \"found.000\" file that I could find.\nIs it possible that running Ubuntu in this unsupported RAID1 configuration would cause data corruption problems to files available through the Windows OS?  I backed up my most important files, so I could restore specific files if they are corrupt.  I have no idea how to interpret the windows chkdsk log, perhaps this would give some indication about which files (if any) were damaged.\n\nA: YES - running Wubi on top of an unsupported storage configuration can absolutely cause damage!  That's why you are told it's not supported!\nThe data corruption certainly affects the underlying NTFS file system, and files on it. root.disk was file in Windows, and it got wiped out, right?\nAll the chkdsk log is saying is that there were a lot of errors in the Master File Table, or index of files. The file data itself may have been unaffected, but the file system now may have no idea of where to find that data. \nI recommend you restore files from backup as you notice they are missing. \n", "Q: How can I upload to a PPA without .changes file?

But I only use Dovecot myself, so I don't know about the others.\n", "Q: stuck in busybox after update I should start out by saying that I am not very tech savvy and have done my best to understand what is going on here from reading other people's posts and have fumbled my way through several attempted fixes without getting anywhere...\nI run ubuntu 12.04 on an admittedly cheap laptop from ebuyer and in spite of being cheap and not a brand laptop I have never had any major problems with it. Since updating to 12.04 when it was released the boot-up process has always been slow. Logging in takes about 30secs longer than it used to and if I closed my laptop and opened it again instead of being met with a login screen I'd  be met with a black screen with a white mouse. As all of these problems had a behavior-changing fix (don't close laptop, patiently wait for login, etc.) I didn't think of reporting any of the issues.\nLast night when the update manager prompted me that there were updates available I duly did them as I usually do. At the time a bug report came up and I cannot remember what it said but I reported the bug as I was prompted to do. Then this morning when I started up my laptop it went through the usual sequence, GRUB, purple screen with 'ubuntu' etc. and then when it tried to boot up it went into BusyBox and I have not been able to do anything to solve this.\nI have tried going into the GRUB menu and starting previous versions but I come to the same point - busybox. I have borrowed another rather elderly laptop with Windows Vista to try and download Boot Repair and Ubuntu and burn them onto CD. I tried downloading boot repair five times, to laptop, CD and USB. Every time it would download and burn fine but then the windows laptop would tell me that 1% did not download properly and my laptop would not run the USB or CD upon booting. I then tried to download ubuntu and make a livecd, twice, but again was told that 1% did not download properly and again my laptop will not run ubuntu from the CD upon booting even if/when I went into the f2 menu and changed the menu priority (if that's what you call it) for booting up to make sure it was definitely trying the USB/CD first. \nThis is the message I get from busybox:\n    BusyBox v1.18.5 (Ubuntu 1:1.18.5-1ubuntu4) built-in shell (ash)\n    Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands\n\nI have tried 'exit' but it mentions things about 'kernal panic' and 'tried to quit init!' and 'can't find /root/dev/console : no such file'. I know that the problem is probably caused by a problem with a kernal caused by the update last night, but I couldn't honestly tell you exactly what was updated and without being able to boot from a livecd I'm not sure how to go about fixing this.\nAs I said, I am not tech savvy and have done what I can to try and find a solution to the problem but I'm starting to feel like I'm out of options. Does anyone have any ideas?\n\nA: I keep getting same problem and finally I got the solution which works every time for me:\nboot your system with LIVE CD or Pendrive\nopen terminal and execute sudo fsck /dev/sdal (sda1 is generally used, if you have a different drive on which ubuntu is installed then give that)\nIt may prompt you several times asking \"y or n\", in that case keep pressing Y.\nafter process is over , reboot the system and remove the pendrive\n", "Q: How to set up dual boot? I used the USB installer to create a bootable USB pendrive from the Ubuntu 12.04 amd64 iso image.\nI followed the basic installation and got Ubuntu on my laptop, alongside with Windows 7, which came with the machine.\nThe problem is I can't find any way to boot Ubuntu when starting windows, unless the pendrive is inserted at startup. When the pendrive is inside, GRUB appears, otherwise, nothing.\nHow can I fix this?\nAnd, secondly, in case I now want to get rid of Windows 7 and assign all space to ubuntu,, what would be the best path to take, now?\n\nA: First Question\nThere are two ways to get grub back.\nMethod 1\nWhile running Ubuntu via Pendrive, install boot-repair, open up a terminal and type the following:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair\n\nboot-repair will automatically launch, if is doesn't, launch it via Dash. Select recommended repair and boot-repair will take care of repairing and getting back grub for you. Reboot.\nMethod 2\nWhile running Ubuntu via Pendrive, you can mount the root partition into which you installed Ubuntu. To mount the partition, you can either mount it via Places in Nautilus or via terminal, by typing sudo mount /media/label_or_name_of_root_partition. For example, to mount the Ubuntu root partition labeled as ubuntu, do this:\nsudo mount /media/ubuntu\n\nOR\nsudo mount /mnt/ubuntu\n\nAfter mounting the root partition of Ubuntu, reinstall grub by specifying the root Ubuntu partition and hard drive:\nsudo grub-install --root-directory=/media/ubuntu /dev/sda\n\nDo not include the partition number on /dev/sda because grub will be installed on the mbr of the hard disk not on a partition.\nAfter the installation, you should see something like this:\nInstallation finished. No error reported.\n\nReboot.\nSecond Question\nIf the time comes and you want to completely remove Windows, you can use GParted to delete the Windows partition and increase the Ubuntu partition with the space gained. There are several tutorials you can find on the web or here to use GParted. This particular post would help you remove windows so Ubuntu fills the hard drive and this Ubuntu Community page remove Windows\n\nA: As for the second part of your question, one tool that you can use to resize/create/delete partitions is GParted. Here is one of many available guides out out there.\n\nA: To repair your boot, use Boot-Repair graphical tool. It will reinstall GRUB and indicate a BootInfo URL in case you still have problems.\nTo remove Windows (or any OS), just use OS-Uninstaller graphical tool.\n", "Q: vga_switcheroo and Intel HD 3000 on Ubuntu 12.04 I'm trying to get vga_switcheroo to enable my integrated Intel HD 3000 instead of my ATI card.

How do I get it to detect all of my RAM?\n\nA: If you use free -g it show your memory round to non decimal numbers. Because of this it shows you just 1GB.\nAn example:\nI have 8GB of ram: \n\n\n*\n\n*free will show \"8167800\"\n\n*because it divides with 1024 free -m will show \"7976\"\n\n*free -g will show \"7\" because it divides with 1024*1024\n\n\nSo free -g is not really helpful if you have the typical among of memory for a PC.\n", "Q: How to install ubuntu from desktop w/o internet access? I am trying to install ubuntu on a netbook without a CD drive. I first attempted a flash drive, but it did not work, so I decided to use the flash drive to transfer the application that can install from the desktop.\nHowever, this is a secondhand school computer that needs its borderline spyware security suite wiped before it can access the internet, so I cannot use the install from desktop application.\nDo I have any other options? I do have access to an external CD drive that I could try, but I am unconvinced that I would get different results since it would have to go through a USB port.\nAny and all input is very much appreciated!\n\nA: You don't need Internet access to install Ubuntu. You only need a LiveCD or LiveUSB.\nMake sure that you created a bootable USB (flash drive). You can also try download the Ubuntu iso (or you already have it) burn that to a CD to create a LiveCD using the school computer, then boot from that CD and create a LiveUSB via Startup Disk Creator which you can launch while running Ubuntu with the LiveCD. Then try the created LiveUSB on your netbook.\n\nA: To install Ubuntu, you either use:\n\n*\n\n*LiveCD (needs CD-ROM Drive).\n\n\n*USBStickQuick (needs USB boot capabilities)\n\n\n*From Windows (if windows installed on the target computer).\nA more comprehensive documentation on the subject and some other installation methods can be found at:\nUbuntu Installation - Community Ubuntu Documentation\n\nAlternatively, you can remove the HDD from your laptop and place it on another laptop with CD-ROM or USB boot capabilities, to swipe the HDD contents, and then install the Ubuntu on it.\nAfter installed return the HDD to the original laptop.\n\nEDITED\nBy your comment regarding the hardware specifications for the mentioned Netbook, it seems to be this Asus Eee PC 1215P:\n\nThe Ubuntu installation is documented as proven to work at:\nHardwareSupport/Machines/Netbooks - Ubuntu Wiki\nFor this netbook, you can access the BIOS and change the boot order to move and select the USB boot as the first option:\n\n*\n\n*Start the Eee PC and press < F2 > repeatedly during boot-up to show the POST screen to enter the BIOS setup. When booting, you can tapping the  key to enter the BIOS setting.\n\n\n*Move cursor to choose \"Boot\" and disable the \"Boot Booster\".\n\n\n*Select the 'Boot Device Priority' and set 'Removable Device' as the 1st Boot Device.\n\n\n*Press < F10 > to save your changes and exit.\n\n", "Q: Web Based Management For LXC Containers? I need a way to manage LXC containers on Ubuntu Server 12.04 - similar to what Proxmox is. Googling indicates that openstack is one option - would this work?\n\nA: OpenStack can manage virtual machine instances, and LXC deployments on bare metal.\nIt might be overkill for your scenario though, it requires a database server, message qeueue server, and many components to be configured (nova, swift, keystone, horizon, etc.).\nIf you do decide to try OpenStack, I suggest you get started with the devstack scripts:\nhttp://devstack.org/\n\nA: Simple webpanel for Ubuntu from 12.04 is http://lxc-webpanel.github.io/.\n", "Q: Does Ubuntu works on 2012 Sony Viao S 15-inch ? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow do I find out which version and derivate of Ubuntu is right for my hardware in terms of minmal system requirements? \n\nCan anyone report whether Ubuntu works on the new (June 2012) Sony Viao S 15?  If so, which version?\n\nA: I have a 2012 Sony Vaio S 1511C5E (Core i7-3612QM, 12GB RAM, with WWAN module, a GOBI 3000, the Intel 4000/nVidia GT640M Optimus hybrid graphics).\nI run Ubuntu 12.04 on it without any major problems.

So it was just under 110% of the minimum size because I wanted a nice round number.\n\n\nPerhaps one or a combination of these items will help solve the issue for you as well.\n\nA: Ok. So what I eventually did to resize it was to resize in increments\nFirst resize, shrink by 5GB, then tried by an additional 10GB, 25GB, and 20GB until it got down to the desired size.\nNot entirely sure why gparted gives an error when it tries to do it all at once, but seems like this strategy works.\nProbably the same technique that @TylerH used (by setting shrink size to 10% larger than before)\n\nA: I didn't provide full background on my approach.  I was resizing a partition at the time I ran into this error.  After successfully resizing I created a new partition with the space created by the resize.  Hence my wording.  But that should be unrelated to the issue here.\nSo, in resizing, i added 10% more space compared to my previous attempts.  Which was successful.  \n", "Q: Is there an Ubuntu program to find anonymous proxy servers? I've been seeking for a software like proxyfire in Ubuntu to connect to the socks proxy with it.

I decided to upgrade to pangolin when I saw it came out. After upgrading the internet was very slow (the estimated time on the updates was something like 4 days). \nI thought maybe this had something to do with the Wine installation, so I decided to finally do an actual dual boot. I partitioned my drive all nice and neat, but I made the mistake of connecting to the internet for the installation, and clicking the option to install updates and restricted extras. \nThis was in the morning, circa 6 am.

I been using this before on back-up, but when I plugged it again, it goes like this, what should I do?\n\n\nA: BACK UP YOUR DATA NOW!!!!\nTurn the machine off, go buy a USB HD if your don't have one and copy everything of value that is on the disk.\nAs a commenter tijybba said above, you can try formatting the drive and plugging and unplugging the drive from the motherboard (edit: I see now from the image it's connected via USB so that's probably a no-go), although it is really unlikely that this will fix the error. SMART Tests not succeeding usually means just what you would expect: the disk will be toast soon.\nYou might want to check which tests are failing by clicking the SMART Data button and scrolling through the list:\n\nThis answer has a good explanation of the tests and which ones are important.\nPlease be advised that I have never had a hard drive last for long when SMART tests began to fail. I recommend you replace with a new HD ASAP.\n\nA: I hate to be telling you this, but you need a new hard drive.  \nHere are things that you can try:\n\n\n*\n\n*Try to clone it. Clonezilla is a good\nstarting point.  Hopefully you will be able to clone the drive.\n\n*If the data on the drive is important, you may want to find a data\nrecovery company,to be able to get your data back.\n\n*You can use rsync to copy everything, file by file, to the same\ndestination on another disk.  Then you can partition, and format the\nway it was before.\n\n*Image the disk to another one big enough, as image file.  Use dd or\ndd-rescue.\n\n\nA: I had the same recently. I kept notes, and here they are.\n\n\n*\n\n*Get yourself a new disk with at least the capacity\n\n*Connect the power and the SATA connector of the disk to your system.\n\n*Boot from an install or live cd or dvd. I used on old 2014 Debian Wheezy.\n\n*Select expert mode, then rescue and get into a shell, which means you can type commands\n\n*Find the identifications of your old and new disks. \nFor this you can try \n\n\n\n   fdisk /dev/sda \n\nand then print the partition table until you know which is which. \n   Replace a by a low alphabetic character. A new disk will have no partitions so that should be easy. \nYou can also disconnect cables and see whether \n\n   ls /dev/sdb2\n\nnow gives a different result. (Pulling SATA cables in a live system is allowed.)\n\n\n*Assuming b is your new disk and a the defective one, now type\n\n\n\n   dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb\n\nand wait. The only reassurement is the hard disk light that will be on. This may and will take hours for a Tera byte disk. \nof means outputfile and if means inputfile. If you mix that up you will end up with two empty disks.\nThis may fail with an error message. In that case you must repeat the command as follows\n\n dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb conv=noerror,sync\n\nThis is the same command as before, but now dd doesn't stop on errors. That would be no good without sync, that results in an empty sector written for each sector that failed to read. Each read error now means at most one file that is missing, but the disk is consistent.\nThe end message should be similar to \n\n 128727972+8 sectors read\n 128727972+8 sectors written \n\nIf the numbers are not equal, the dd failed, check the spelling etc.\nBest is '+0'\n\n\n*Connect the output disk at the place of the new disk and check as follows. (The new disk will now look as /dev/sda ).\nStart up in recovery mode and run \n\n\n\n umount /dev/sda1\n fsck /dev/sda1\n\nRepeat for all partitions you found earlier.\nThere may be problems, e.g. if you didn't `sync' the sector numbers will be offset and an endless stream of error messages result.\nAfter checking, type control-D and enjoy your recovered system.\n\n\n*Mark the defective disk **CRAP* with a permanent marker. Don't use it for anything important, preferably recycle it. Oh I should've told you before: \"Your disk is toast.\". \n\n", "Q: Script to find executable based on extension of a file?

The latest version of Flash for all browsers--Firefox, Chromium and Chrome--all have SSE2 coding which isn't supported by older pre-2003 AMD Athlon CPU's. Both Adobe and Google are aware of this. Adobe has said its not an issue they plan to fix, as support is dropped and only security updates are still being released.\nLooking at the your CPU info, there no support for SSE2 in flags, as is the case on my system and millions of others.\nMy advice to get a Flash functioning browser would be to uninstall Adobe Flash and Chrome and install the  v19 chrome deb. This is the last known working version of Chrome for any browser for Linux systems with no SSE2 capability.\nRun cat /proc/cpuinfo in a terminal. Look for SSE2 in flags. If your CPU has no SSE2, the latest version of Adobe flash will not display Flash in any browser. Chrome version 20 which is the latest stable will also not start.\nThe workaround, for the moment, is to install Version 19 of Chrome as this used the last (NPAPI) version. The issue appears to only affect the  PepperFlash built into Chrome 20.\n\n\n*\n\n*Adobe bug report\n\n*Gentoo bug report\n", "Q: Is there software that can record sound input? I have a Ion Tape 2 Pc Cassette player, is there any software that would record the cassette as I play it?\n\nA: Any audio recorder or audio editor should work.\nI like Audacity because it gives you a fair amount of control and you can lay down multiple overlapping tracks.  You may or may not need that kind of complexity.\nThe trick to sound recording is to get the levels right on your mixer (and on the other device).  You never want it so loud that it clips (goes about -0 dB), but you want it loud enough that it's not too quiet.\nIt looks like your Tape-2-PC device is plug and play, so it should just appear as an audio device in Ubuntu, alongside your PC's built-in sound card.  You'll need to select the correct input device in order to record from it, otherwise it'll just try to record from the Mic/Line-in jack on your computer.\n", "Q: Use vimdiff in place of diff to compare configs during package updates Sometimes when you perform packages updates, you'll be prompted with action to take when apt tries to update packages which contain updated configs.\nI'd like to know if there's a way to invoke vimdiff in place of diff when pressing D in this question.\nConfiguration file `/etc/gnome/defaults.list'\n ==> Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.\n ==> Package distributor has shipped an updated version.\n   What would you like to do about it ?

I would like to know where I can find the location of program files of programs installed from the Ubuntu Software Center. \n\nA: For the programs installed system wide whereis command helps\nwhereis vim\n\nBut I like to use which command. \ne.g. which vim shows the location of vim which'll be used, if you tried to run vim command on terminal. Also whereis command won't show the location of command if its in your home directory. For example. if your ~/bin directory has a command pqr whereis won't show the location of pqr. which pqr shows its location too.\nIf you have set the aliases for the commands, for example if your terminal understands the shortcut c for clear command for example, you can get the original command, by typing the command:\ntype c\n\nIt will output:\n\nc is aliased to clear\n\n\nA: In terminal try using whereis\nwhereis <name of the program>\n\nIt will give the locations of program path.\ne.g\nwhereis apt\napt: /etc/apt /usr/lib/apt /usr/share/apt /usr/share/man/man8/apt.8.gz\n\n\nA: In general you shouldn't need to know the location of programs, because if you need to run them from the command-line then they'll be on your path anyway, and if you run them from within the GUI, or within another application, they'll be set up in there by their installation script.\nBut if you are curious, most executables will be placed into /usr/bin\n(Or at least a symbolic link from there will exist to the executable.)\nThere are exceptions.  There will be some system-related ones that are available from /bin instead, and some system-related ones only intended for superuser access (ie, for use with sudo) in /sbin.\nThe which command can be used to find out exactly where an application is (if you run it by typing its name on the command-line).  You use it like which <command> where command is replaced with the command you'd type.  For example:\nwhich apt-get\n\nTells you: /usr/bin/apt-get.  As I said above, most executables are placed in /usr/bin ;)\nIf you type the following\nls /usr/bin -l\n\nThen it will show you all the files in /usr/bin.  You'll then notice that some of them are actually symbolic links to elsewhere.\nNow, /usr/bin will only contain the executable file.  All of its support files will be in different locations (usually within /usr).  For example, library files it requires will be in /usr/lib, and non-executable data files it needs will be in /usr/share.  It may also store configuration or state information in /var/lib, or in users' home directories.\n\nA: Other than on Windows, on Linux systems an application is (usually -- there are few exceptions) not tried to be installed into \"one place\" (no such thing like C:\\Program Files\\AppName holding almost all the applications files). \nInstead there are dedicated places where to put executables (what you call from the command line or via your graphical interface's menu), another for libraries used by applications (so multiple applications can share the same library and automatically profit from its updates), configuration files, documentation, and so on. \nAs already pointed out, you can use the which command to tell you the executable used, and there is the whereis command. A third command coming in handy is locate, which would list up all files in the system having the specified string in their /path/to/filename, plus the powerful find command. \nYou can get more information about each of them reading their Man pages -- e.g. man find would tell you how to use the find command.\n\n", "Q: How to enable touchpad?

It is set to folder selection mode. When the widget is clicked it shows a dropdown list of Nautilus bookmarks with an 'other' option in the end. A new file chooser dialog is launched when 'other' is clicked. The button is not connected to any other custom file chooser dialog.\nThe connecting signal I am using is 'file-set' and I am retrieving the fullpath of user selected folder using Gtk.FileChooser.get_current_folder ().\nThis setup works fine if user selects a folder from 'other' option. But if a user selects a bookmark from dropdown list, no path is returned. How to solve this?\nIs there a way to disable this dropdown list and directly go to the filechooser dialog? I want to use GtkFileChooserButton only so that the user can get a preview of his selected folder.\n\nA: Because the file-set signal is only sent when the user changes the file, you will need to actually do the get_current_folder() call when you need to know the path, and not when the file-set signal is called. From the documentation, I see no way to get a notification when the user selects a path from the bookmarks, in folder selection mode.\nAs an alternative, though, you could use the FileChooserButton in normal mode, and simply use get_current_folder when the file-set signal is sent. This should give you the directory which the user is in, when a file is selected. Unfortunately, the UI will also look weird in this case, as the button will show the filename, while you're actually using the directory.\nAlso, you should probably file a bug against upstream GTK+ about this use case and how it isn't usable. The file-set signal really should be deprecated and renamed to path-set, and used in both modes.\n\nA: I used the current_folder_changed signal inherited from GtkFileChooser and it seems to work even with the bookmarks.\n\nA: GtkFileChooserButton in Folder Select mode can return the folder URI. Use urlparse module to convert URI to path. This works even with bookmarks. Hope this solves your issue.\nimport urlparse\n\nfolder_uri = filechooserbutton_meas.get_uri()\nfolder = urlparse.urlparse(folder_uri).path \n\n\nA: \nThis setup works fine if user selects a folder from 'other' option. But if a user selects a bookmark from dropdown list, no path is returned. How to solve this?\n\nWith GtkFileChooserButton, 'folder selection' mode.\nThe following code is good enough:\ndef on_mybutton_selection_changed(self, w):\n   print \"selected folder: \", w.get_file().get_path()\n\nWe get directory path on every selection of the dropdown menu, even bookmarks.\n\nI used the current_folder_changed signal inherited from GtkFileChooser and it seems to work even with the bookmarks.\n\nCaution with w.get_current_folder().

After Upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04, the login process of Gnome 3 is extremely slow (It takes in the order of 60 seconds when it was in the order of a few seconds before the upgrade (Harddisk is a SSD!)).\nRunning \"top\" in a VT shows that gnome-shell is producing about 90% CPU load while dbus-daemon is taking roughly 10%. The moment when CPU-load of gnome-shell drops to normal levels (around 2-3%) corresponds to the time the login process is terminated and the desktop is displayed.\nDe-activating the four gnome-shell extensions (Alternative Status Menu, Quit Button, Remove Accessibility, system-monitor) that I have installed does not have any effect on session start up time.\nLogin to Gnome classic does not show the slow session start.\nThe system logs do not show anything suspicious. Thus, what is the best way to identify the underlying problem?\n\nA: I know this question is ancient, but it shows up near the top of the Google results, so I thought I'd throw up an answer to the question in the title —\nOne way to identify the problem works like this:\nStart to log in to your session, but, also have another session (as another user, or on a \"tty\" session (Control+Alt+[F2…]), or via ssh, or …) already open, with a text shell (bash) prompt ready.\nKey in (but don't hit Return yet) this command:\n\n\n*\n\n*you may need to sudo this command if your other shell is a different user account\n\n*This is one, long line\n\n\ngdb attach /usr/bin/gnome-shell $(pgrep -u your login gnome-shell) -ex 'call gjs_dumpstack ()'\ne.g. gdb attach /usr/bin/gnome-shell $(pgrep -u jdoe gnome-shell) -ex 'call gjs_dumpstack ()'\nAs soon as the shell is \"too busy,\" i.e. \"catch it in the act,\" in your other shell, hit Return to trap it. It will freeze up the shell and might kill your login attempt, but you'll have your backtrace.\nYou'll get a welcome banner from the debugger. (You may also be told that you need to install some debuginfo packages, on Fedora at least, I'm not sure if Ubuntu will do the same, but I presume it's similar. You shouldn't actually need these to debug the JavaScript side of things; that only applies to debugging the C part of the code.)\nThis will show the stack of active JavaScript functions, which will almost certainly show the culprit.\nYou can find more detailed information here: https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GnomeShell/Debugging\n\nA: I had a similar problem, and pinned it down to the contacts system -- I did that by running strace -p on the gnome-shell process, and looking for the contents of the system calls.\nI give my eventual solution in my blog entry here.

But the Gnome-shell testing ppa does. So you can try adding it to your list of repositories. But use caution because they are unstable builds. \n\nA: You could try adding the webupd8 gnome3 ppa.

I run an organisation that cleans data from donated laptops and reinstalls minimal operating systems and office for poor schools in rural India.\nI plan to boot and wipe the laptops I receive, but I don't know what to do after that to install Ubuntu. Which release/variant/version should I burn onto CD/DVD?\nIn terms of software, would like to install at least OpenOffice on the laptops.\n\nA: Well now, this is a very good question. I assume that the laptops will be of a low spec because they are second hand, so I would suggest current versions of Lubuntu or Xubuntu.\nIt is worth, however, trying out all the versions to see which people respond to the best.\nThese should all come with Libre Office installed by default.\n\nA: As you mention schools as recipients of the laptop, Edubuntu would be the logical choice, unless performance of your hardware is a real concern. In the latter case, you might look at the Ubuntu derivatives. Ubuntulite could then be an option (or Lubuntu if you want to stay with a \"recognised flavor\")\nAs an additional thought: Edubuntu 12.04 is an LTS release, i.e. being supported for 5 years, while Lubuntu is only supported for 18 months (and therefore needs dist-upgrading (\"heavy maintenance\") earlier than Edubuntu!)\n\nA: Hopefully you will receive hundreds of used laptops for your project. Erasing and installing Ubuntu will however then mean a lot of time consuming work until you can give away the laptops again. Therefore we need to keep the steps involved reliable, and as fast as possible.\nFor one simple but important reason I would rather suggest you go for standard Ubuntu rather than for the somewhat less popular variants Lubuntu, Xubuntu, or Edubuntu: people in rural areas will somewhat more likely get help for the mainstream Ubuntu than for the other variants. Only if you have many very old machines that can't even run Unity2D you may consider one of the more lightweight distribution variants.\nSteps involved:\n\n\n*\n\n*download the installation CD \n\n*make a bootable USB drive from that (installation is faster than from CD)  \n\n*alternatively user Remastersys from a running and updated  installation to clone to the other machines.\nFor each laptop:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot with this USB drive (you may need to adapt the BIOS for that)  \n\n*Choose Try out Ubuntu on the welcome screen to start a live session  \n\n*Wipe data on the drives with any of the following in a root terminal \n dd if=/dev/zero of=/sdx  # for low security or when disks were encrypted\n dd if=/dev/urandom of=/sdx  # for a more secure wiping  \n\nreplace /sdx with the appropriate for the hard drive(s), take care to  not wipe your USB drive. For other secure wiping tools see this question.\n\n*close the terminal and choose \"Install Ubuntu\" from the same live session\n\n*Remove the USB and reboot when done\n\n*Update the system (optionally you may also install proprietary graphics drivers now)\nBy going through the above step of a live session before installing we have the advantage to see that the laptops are healthy, and we can also verify their hardware is capablae of running Ubuntu.\n\nA: I will suggest Xubuntu , and you can Download the package LibreOffice from here for Common Manual Installation.\nSince you will be using Lower Specs Laptop ( Used one) Xubuntu will be better choice or ,  Other alternate way would be Making a Custom Live CD so that you can include all the packages required basically for Education of Minors. You can browse the Edubuntu Apps and add them  if found interesting for that age group .\nThis way you can include Libreoffice and other things specifically , and remove other things not needed in Xubuntu. This way you can actually distribute these custom ISO and get help in making it available quickly through all your Laptops. \n", "Q: Software to draw signals, time-diagrams, etc for electronics?

Also, if Im installing Ubuntu as the only OS, do I need to defrag my hard drive at all before I do this? Thanks for any help in advance! \n\nA: No defragging needed. \n\n\n*\n\n*If you want take a backup of your Ubuntu system just now ( Optional )\n\n*Then bang in your live CD and format the disk then install Ubuntu\n\n*Then you can restore your current install ( Optional if followed step 1 )\n\n\n\"Erase disk and install Ubuntu\" - This will do as exactly as you need\nBut your plan seems sound. Just use the Live CD as stated and you will be all good. Leaving you with one large Ubuntu Install :)\nBill\n\nA: You can just install a fresh copy of ubuntu without defraging the hard disk, but remember this will erase everything on your hard disk so i recommend making a back-up of important document. Ubuntu installation menu is much clear and easy, go for option number one on the installation menu and yes its possible to use a live CD.\n\nA: \n\"\"erase disk and install Ubuntu\"\"\n\nIf you have another Storage , do a backup of required data , if by \"erase disk\" you mean ERASING everything in hard drive ,YES it is possible through Live CD.\nOr if you have other unspecified partitions then for deleting the Dual Boot configuration ,  during installation you will get the option to delete create or format Partitions already available. Where you can clear the Dual Boot by deleting the Windows Installation drive and Ubuntu Installation Drive ( Your Data will also be deleted , so Backup is a wise thing to do if required).\nNow you are ready to install Ubuntu as per your Convenience.\nAs far as Defragging is Concerned , no you don't need to defrag the Partition  ( If you formatted in ext4 format) as long as you don't want to make it usable by windows. If Formatted in NTFS , then it may need defragging by Windows . Defragging has different meaning in Linux/ Ubuntu , it defrags inodes to boost performance.\n\nA: I would leave the ASUS recovery partition. \nIf the disk was partitioned correctly Recovery would be the first (primary) \npartition. (You could change your mind later and 10GB is not much \"waste\".)\nThe rest could be devoted to Ubuntu. \nAgain it is best to make at least 2 new partitions - one for / root 100GB is enough,\nand another for data. (+1 for swap).\nAll new partitions can be logical as Ubuntu/Linux does not need primary partitions for installation.\nYou could leave also some space unpartitioned where you could install newer Ubuntu/Linux version later for experiments.

(i.e. as a USB SD-card reader). If it also shows up as a modem simultaneously, then YES! (I've seen older phones that do one or the other, depending on an internal setting).\nYou should be able to tell if the first thing is true by connecting the phone before boot, and seeing if it comes up in the list of boot options when you press the appropriate F-key.

It made my 12.04(in Virtualbox) lag so badly, I had to shut it down.\nMy question is what does this command do?\n\n :(){ :|: & };:\n\n\nA: That command is a well known version of the fork bomb\n\nIt causes your computer to run out of memory by forking a process infinitely. There exist some safeguards you can use against it as well:\n\nUnix-type systems typically have a process-limit, controlled by a ulimit shell command or its successor, setrlimit. Linux kernels set and enforce the RLIMIT_NPROC rlimit (\"resource limit\") of a process. If a process tries to perform a fork and the user that owns that process already owns RLIMIT_NPROC processes, then the fork fails. Additionally, on Linux or *BSD, one can edit the pam_limits config file /etc/security/limits.conf to the same effect. However, not all distributions of Linux have the pam_limits module installed by default.\n\n\nA: This is called a fork bomb.\n:() means you are defining a function called :\n{:|: &} is the : function's body. It calls the function : recursively and sends (pipes) its output to another call of :. And & means the created process must run in the background.\nThe ; is a command separator.\nThe final : runs the function the first time.\nEssentially you are creating a function that calls itself twice every call and doesn't have any way to terminate itself. It will keep doubling up until you run out of system resources.\nRunning in Virtualbox was quite sensible really otherwise you would have had to restart your pc.\n\nA: According to this :(){ :|: & };: is called \n\nForkbomb is a kind of poetic virus creator\n...The devious little program commands it to make multiple copies of\n  itself, setting off a chain reaction and thus quickly exhausting the\n  system’s resources...\n\nSo advised not to run this, could cause damage to hardware since it causes loopwise execution, may cause heating easily in laptops.\nAnother link explains through screen shots here.\n\nA: It is called a “fork-bomb”, as explained above, and another way of doing this would be to use background execution rather than piping:\n:(){ :&:;};:\n\n\nA: This is a so called fork bomb implemented in shell.\nfrom wikipedia:\n:(){ :|:& };:\n\\_/| |||| ||\\- ... the function ':', initiating a chain-reaction: each ':' will start    two more.\n | | |||| |\\- Definition ends now, to be able to run ...\n | | |||| \\- End of function-block\n | | |||\\- disown the functions (make them a background process), so that the children    of a parent\n | | |||   will not be killed when the parent gets auto-killed\n | | ||\\- ... another copy of the ':'-function, which has to be loaded into memory.\n | | ||   So, ':|:' simply loads two copies of the function, whenever ':' is called\n | | |\\- ... and pipe its output to ...\n | | \\- Load a copy of the function ':' into memory ...\n | \\- Begin of function-definition\n \\- Define the function ':' without any parameters '()' as follows:\n\n", "Q: Installing 12.04's boot loader on the partition boot record I want to install ubuntu , without it touching my MBR. I plan to install ubuntu 12.04 on a particular ext3 partition and grub on the PBR of that partition. \nFrom this page: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot\n\nIf you have a problem with changing the MBR code, you might prefer to just install the code for pointing to GRUB to the first sector of your Ubuntu partition instead. If you do that during the Ubuntu installation process, then Ubuntu won't boot until you configure some other boot manager to point to Ubuntu's boot sector.\n\nSo it tell me what I have to do. My question is how do I do this ? \nI am guessing I have to\n\n\n*\n\n*grab the alternate install disc\n\n*choose manual partitioning\n\n*it will ask me to install grub and I have to choose the partition instead of the MBR .\n\n*edit boot.ini to add ubuntu . I am on xp.\n\n\nAre these steps correct ? Please tell , I am asking because I really don't want to screw this up. \nAlso are there any other gotachas I should keep in mind ? Like updating screwing up the MBR ?\nThanks\nEdit: One question: in the alternate install CD , where exactly is the option to install grub in PBR ?\nEdit2: why does anything I am trying to do has a bug associated wit it .\n\nA: You can install Grub to a partition boot record even with the Desktop CD!\nJust choose manual partitioning, and choose to install the bootloader to /dev/sdaN.\nThe XP bootloader (NTLDR) will not chainload Grub2 by default.\nNote that NTLDR will NOT chainload Grub2 by default. You will need an intermediary such as Grub4DOS (recommended), or create a Grub2 stub for NTLDR.\nA downside of installing Grub2 to a PBR\nWhen installed to a PBR, Grub2 is very sensitive to moving/resizing the partition; you will need to reinstall it from a Live-CD/Live-USB if you do that.\nThe easiest alternative: a boot manager such as Plop\nPersonally, I recommend the Plop! Boot Manager as a tiny, pain-free way to get this working without having to mess with boot.ini, etc. It basically gives you a menu at bootup allowing you to choose a primary or logical partition to boot from.\n\nA: Yes. Those are correct steps. \nHowever you might have problem while adding boot menu entry in XP. If you were in windows vista or 7 EasyBCD can do this very easily.\nHere is an answer that might help you though it suggests downgrading of grub 2\nhttps://askubuntu.com/a/126494/35775\n\nA: Yes, these steps are correct (and you can also do it from a standard Ubuntu CD).\nYou may also want to first create a backup of your MBR and partition table. This can be done easily via Boot-Repair -> Advanced options -> \"Backup the partition tables, boot sectors..\".\n", "Q: Build failed on launchpad \nPossible Duplicate:\nLaunchpad failed to build after “quickly submitubuntu” \n\nI am still getting this error:\n\n/bin/sh: 1: glib-compile-schemas: not found\n\nThe full log:\nhttps://launchpadlibrarian.net/109259873/buildlog_ubuntu-precise-i386.facebookupload_12.07.6_FAILEDTOBUILD.txt.gz\nI already tried to add libglib2.0-bin  on the dependencies but this fix didn't work.\nI tried to run quickly configure dependencies but this command is going to add it under \" Depends:\" instead of \"Build-Depends:\"\nEach time I run quickly submit the control file is going to be overwritten.\nDoes anyone found how to fix it?\n\nA: Please, allow me to redirect you to here, as this issue is addressed in this question (it's a bug with quickly, NOT your app. Or you don't have libglib2 installed)\n", "Q: How to switch windows manager on-the-fly? I know there's a command to let compiz take over from whatever windows manager is running, using compiz --replace &, same for unity with unity --replace &. What are the similar commands for other window managers (e.g. KDE4's plasma, Gnome, LXDE, XFCE)? And will this take all running application windows along?\n\nA: Pretty much any window manager can replace the one currently running. Normally, you use the --replace option. Read the window manager's man page for details. You just need to determine the command name for a particular wm. Google or apropos can help you there.\nExamples:\nxfwm --replace   # xfce, I think\nmetacity --replace   # default wm in Gnome 2\nicewm --replace    # old-school wm, my favorite back in the 1990s before modern wms\n\nSwitching wms won't have any effect on which windows are open, though it'll likely affect their placement.\nBy the way, even though desktop environments such as Gnome, KDE, or Xfce have a default wm that works well with the environment, window managers are actually separate and can normally be mixed and matched. Note, however, that some window managers also provide some other features, such as panels, which you won't have if you switch wms.\nEdit\nDeterming the proper command to use: These kinds of things are really easy to determine for yourself. Just take a guess at the beginning of the name. For example, \"open\". Then start typing the first few letters and hit Tab. If the name isn't completed,  hit Tab a second time to see a list of possible matches. Once you've found the command name, type man <command_name> to access documentation.\nIf you can't find the command name that way, look at the process list through some system monitor such as htop while the program in question is running. You'll see it there, though you might not be able to use the command in exactly the same form as it's listed, particularly if it's running through an interpreter such as Python.\n\nA: I know it's a while ago -- but as usual, after one stops looking for it, answers pop up. So I just discovered the fusion-icon package for Ubuntu: CompizFusionIcon is exactly for this, to switch between different window managers.\n\nSo in case somebody else is still looking for an easy and convenient solution, this is another option.\n\nA: The fusion-Icon does no longer work. But: there is another way, how I managed to enable Emald-Window-manager in Xubuntu 13.04.\nStep one: we need two terminal-commands\nTherefore, we need our Terminal and there we have to enter these commands:\nsudo apt-get install git autoconf libtool libwnck1.0-cil-dev libwnck-dev intltool libdecoration0-dev gawk compizconfig-settings-manager\nThen follows this command here:\nwget cgit.compiz.org/fusion/decorators/emerald/snapshot/emerald-0.9.5.tar.gz\nAfterwards follows this command:\ntar -zxvf emerald-0.9.5.tar.gz && cd emerald-0.9.5/\nThis extracts this package to your home-directory (in my case, this was like that).\nThen close your Terminal and go to this directory /home //emerald-0.9.5\nStep two: run the file autogen-sh in this directory\nThere search for a file called autogen.sh.\nClick this file and let it run. This goes pretty fast.\nThen close this file and close your home-directory and go back to the Terminal.\nStep three: Cleanout\nWe again need to open the Terminal and enter these commands:\nmake clean\nmake distclean\nThen cd to the directory of emerald:\ncd /home/<your name>/emerald-0.9.5\nThen enter these commands:\n./configure --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib${LIBDIRSUFFIX} LIBS='-ldl -lm'\nmake\nsudo make install\nThen close your Terminal and go to CompizConfig Settings Manager.\nStep four: setting Emerald as window-manager\nIn CompizConfig Settings Manager, go to \"general\" and there to \"Windows-Decoration\". There enter the following command:\ncompiz --replace\nThen close CCSM and go to the Emerald-Theme-Manager and select one of your downloaded Themes.\nStep five: Finalization of setting Emerald-Theme-manager\nopen your Terminal and run:\ncompiz --replace\nThat's just it.\n", "Q: How can I add a Notebook background in Glade?

Sometimes they have support for newer cards than the default Ubuntu drivers, too.\nAs you've found out, AMD has dropped support for your card in fglrx, so that option is not available to you.

When I set up an interface, with IP netmask etc, everything works, but in less than a minute ubuntu remove all my configuration and shows a message saying \"activation of network connection failed\". My guess is that it is trying to get the IPs via DHCP, but I'm not using anything of that.\nAnyone knows some way to disable that automatic configuration?\n\nA: In Ubuntu the network configuration is managed by Network Manager. As you suspected, if you change your IP by hand (using ifconfig), as soon as it detects the change it will revert it.\nYou can either disable it or use it to change the ip configuration.\nTo disable Network Manager:\n\n\n*\n\n*From the GUI, click on the network icon, uncheck activate network.\n\n*From the commnad line : nmcli nm enable false\nOr to stop the service\nsudo service NetworkManager stop\n\nYou can use nmcli to control Network Manager from the command line, including creating new connections or changing between them. Or you can just use the GUI, click on the network icon and select edit connections. There, you can either change the default connection or add another one with a fixed IP.\n", "Q: How could Chinese users pay for an app in software center?

I have an MSI Radeon HD 7850 card. MSI provide no Linux support, and the AMD driver gives me an Unsupported Hardware watermark that does not show up in screenshots.\nI uninstalled the proprietary driver and found that Unity 3D no longer works, and I really only picked Ubuntu because of the excellent shortcuts provided in the recent versions. \nTrying to locate the open source driver has been a pain for me.

That way the computers can talk directly.\nTo be honest though, I doubt you'll get much speed increase if any, because the limiting factor is more likely to be wifi transmission speed 802.11g.\n\nA: Edit: sorry I thought you said without wifi. so Adhoc is what you're looking for.\nBut if you want the fastest, connect 2 PCs to a router with Ethernet.\n", "Q: Two of my partitions disappeared. I can t access these partitions from Nautilus However GParted detects them. The filesystems were ext4 and NTFS (old Windows partition). They used to be mounted at /media/part1 for the ext4 and /media/ntfs.\nLast night after reading through the man pages for mount and fs, I put together this solution: create the missing directories in the /media directory and then type:\nsudo mount /dev/sda1 ext4\n\n... etc.\nIs this the way to fix the problem?\n\nA: If your partitions are labeled you can try with:\nudisks --mount /dev/disk/by-label/<partition-label>\n\nwhich will mount your partition in /media/<partition-label>. For labeling partitions (which is just naming them), you can use GParted. It is nice to have labels for your partitions anyway. udisks if configured correctly does not prompt you for root privileges.\nAnother way is issuing:\nsudo blkid\n\nto get your partitions UUID, and using\nudisks --mount /dev/disk/by-uuid/<partition-uuid>\n\n(This mounts the partition in /media/<partition-label> if the partition has a label.)\nRead man udisks to see other features.\n", "Q: Error while running Jetty Server on port 80 as non root user All,\nI was trying to setup jetty on port 80 but its giving exception saying permission denied as below.

I'm from windows background. I wish to know where do all commands like exit,clear comes from in my terminal? \nAnd are they scripts? In what language they have been written? \n\nA: this depends:-) Some are internal commands of your shell, some scripts, some are compiled programs.\nYou can find out more with the type command: For example: type type gives (in my cygwin bash!) type is a shell builtin. \nIf you type type bash, your answer will be something like bash is /usr/bin/bash.\nNow you can inspect what type of file /usr/bin/bash is: file /usr/bin/bash says  something like ... executable ..., so this will be a compiled file, presumably written in C, FORTRAN or whatever. If the answer is something like ... script...  you can inspect this file with a normal text editor like gedit, vim or whatever you like.\n\nA: Most of all , i can rather say ALMOST all commands came from UNIX , a Predecessor and fundamental mechanism Behind LINUX. \nMost of the Utilities , like mv- move , cp- copy is a utility in Linux since they are utilize to do basic management functions.This holds true for every other such utilities , i would rather say Utilities providing Functionalities to integrate and make it as whole Principle Operation based OS kind of Entity.\nNow coming to topic , these Commands or Utilities were mostly developed by GNU called Core GNU utilities .\nYou will find most of the basic commands from Core Utilities description page, said that , Linux is just a Name of Kernel, Whereas Ubuntu is an Entire Advanced Integrated OS of such utilities.\nCommands are mostly written in C language , Shell is an Interpreter between kernel  and Commands. Bash being the Best of them.\nAbout scripts , not entirely they are not , for scripting purpose Python & Perl are used ,accessible in bash.\nNote: In Ubuntu you will find Coreutils installed .\n\nThis package contains the basic file, shell and text manipulation\n  utilities which are expected to exist on every operating system.\nSpecifically, this package includes: arch base64 basename cat chcon\n  chgrp chmod chown chroot cksum comm cp csplit cut date dd df dir\n  dircolors dirname du echo env expand expr factor false flock fmt fold\n  groups head hostid id install join link ln logname ls md5sum mkdir\n  mkfifo mknod mktemp mv nice nl nohup nproc od paste pathchk pinky pr\n  printenv printf ptx pwd readlink rm rmdir runcon sha*sum seq shred\n  sleep sort split stat stty sum sync tac tail tee test timeout touch tr\n  true truncate tsort tty uname unexpand uniq unlink users vdir wc who\n  whoami yes\n\nFor inbuilt Clear command functionality  in Bash shell you can use Ctrl+L\n\nA: Some of them are part of the functionality of the interpreter you are working at(I presume you are using bash), but can be overridden with one that is not built-in(should such an executable exist) using envcommmand. The rest of the important commands are in /bin or /sbin, which is on your path, giving quick access to these commands almost seamlessly.\n\nA: They are usually written in C, but they might also be ba/sh, python, perl, ... scripts (such adduser being a perl wrapper to useradd). You can tell which scripting language they are written in by looking at the first line of the script itself or at the line which starts with #! (eg: #!/usr/bin/perl). This is of course not valid for compiled C commands.\nThey are located in /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin mainly and you can access them from anywhere (giving you the impression of being lower level commands) because they are in your PATH environmental variable.\n", "Q: How to install Ubuntu on a zeroed-out drive?

The problem only happens when I plug my laptop into the same breaker as my recording computer. The problem isn't with your computer's software or hardware per se, it's more the amount of power being drawn and the sound card's amplifier(s) don't have enough power to constantly draw power.

It came preinstalled with Windows 7. I tried installing Ubuntu 12.04 through a USB stick. It boots up ok, but during installation it could not detect the 500GB disk. Before starting the installation I shrunk the partion and made an empty partition using Windows disk management. Please help.\n\nA: I have exactly the same problem with a new HP ENVY-4. I have tried all the suggested 'cures' above.\n\n\n*\n\n*Shrunk Windows using built in Windows \"shrink\".  This freed up 226 GB.\n\n*Ran sudo gparted with a LIVE boot of Ubuntu 12.04 to partition the free\ndisk space into extended partition and then partitions for system, swap and /home\n\n*The Ubuntu installer does NOT SEE ANY DISK DRIVE except the USB one it is running from. While 'gparted' sees the drive fine.\n\n\nThe original HP partitioning is (roughly)\n 4 Gb 'system'   partition\n 400 Gb 'OS'       partition\n 100 Gb 'recovery' partition\n  ?? Gb 'backup' ? partition\n\nMy 'best guess' is that for some (unknown?!) reason HP has set up the laptop disk and controller using \"FakeRaid\" - which makes no sense to me since there isn't a duplicate disk with 500 GB to \"mirror\" the hard drive to.\nI found this community reference for installing Ubuntu to a \"fake raid\" device but note that it doesn't cover Ubuntu 12.04  AND  the instructions seem really complicated  AS WELL AS being different for every version of system referred to (as well as hardware setup?):\nhttp://help.ubuntu.com/community/FakeRaidHowto\nIn short I tried digging into this but quickly was over my head and caused my computer to jump into RESTORE mode - which (in an hour or so) returned it to the \"store bought\" configuration.\nI don't understand why the manufacturer created this mess to start with.\nI don't understand why, since GParted can understand the hardware, partition it, etc. that (by now !!) the installer hasn't had this capability added to it.\nOK, there is a lot I don't understand.  Among them is how to follow the community instructions to successfully install Ubuntu 12.04 on my new laptop.\nI miss my old Sony, on which comfortably ran Ubuntu for many years.  I thought problems like this were behind Linux as the community has grown and large corporations have begun adding support for Linux.  I guess I was wrong about this too.\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION:\nI was, eventually, able to successfully install Ubuntu on my HP Envy-4, but in the process of getting there (rebuilding Windows 7 several times) I had damaged Win7 RECOVERY partition - so it is not dual-boot with Win7, but it is dual-boot with other Linux distributions.\nI documented this (last) process in a .pdf which I put up on Dropbox for access.\nHopefully it will provide some information that will help for others who are dealing with the challenge of installing Ubuntu on the Envy-4 ultrabook.\n\n\n*\n\n*(How to) Install Ubuntu on HP Envy 4 Ultrabook [PDF]\n\nA: I have a soution.

Here are my steps:\nRemove fake raid\nHP sets up a (pretty useless) fake raid between the two drives (500GB hard drive and 32GB SSD). You need to get rid of this as a first step:\n\n\n*\n\n*Boot on the Ubuntu CD and type the following:\nsudo dmraid -E -r /dev/sda\n\n\n*Reboot the computer. You should get a screen telling you the RAID array is in a weird state and inviting you to press <Ctrl>+I to enter RAID setup. Do that, and choose option 3 (Reset disks to non-RAID);\n\n*Let Windows 7 reboot and check/fix its C: drive.\nFree some space\nWhile you're on Windows 7, fire up the disk utility and resize the \"OS\" partition (which is the biggest one, around 400GB). In my case, I freed 320G and left about 120GB for Windows.\nCreate new partitions\nNow comes the tricky part. HP sets up 4 primary partitions in the hard drive (the 500GB one), which makes it not possible to create new partitions unless you delete one (the limit is 4 primary partitions). Some people on Windows 7 are having the same issue to create a data partition.\nFortunately for us, HP doesn't make use of the full capacity of the 32GB SSD. They only set up a 4GB partition to use as cache for Windows 7 (to ease suspend if I understood correctly). We will use that space to back up the recovery partition for now, and we will use it to install the OS later, making it a very fast setup.\nHere are the steps I followed:\n\n\n*\n\n*Reboot on the Ubuntu live CD and fire up Gparted (or your favorite partitioning utility);\n\n*Create a new ext4 partition on /dev/sdb (the SSD drive) using the whole unallocated space (about 25GB);\n\n*Mount the new partition on /mnt:\nsudo mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt\n\n\n*We will now remove a primary partition in order to be able to create an extended one. Since I was not sure about touching the HP_TOOLS partition (which apparently is used directly by the BIOS), I chose to deal with the recovery partition (which is /dev/sda3 in my case). First, let's save its data where we have some space (that is, on the newly created /dev/sdb2):\nsudo dd id=/dev/sda3 of=/mnt/recovery.iso\n\n\n*Now that the data from the recovery partition is saved, we can remove the partition. In Gparted, remove the recovery partition (/dev/sda3 in my case). This should leave you with a big unallocated space of the space you saved before by resizing the \"OS\" partition plus the space of the recovery partition. In my case, it gives me a 340GB unallocated space. Create a new extended partition on this space and then create new logical partitions in this extended partition. In my case, I created 3 logical partitions:\n\n\n*\n\n*A 20GB NTFS partition labeled \"RECOVERY\";\n\n*A 4GB linux-swap partition;\n\n*An ext4 partition using the rest of the unallocated space (about 316GB).\n\n\n*Note the identifier of the newly created partitions. In my case, the 20GB NTFS partition is /dev/sda5 and the ext4 partition is /dev/sda6;\n\n*It's time to put back the recovery partition data in place. Run the following (adapt if your partition number is different):\nsudo dd if=/mnt/recovery.iso of=/dev/sda5\n\n\n*Just in case of future problems, I chose to copy /mnt/recovery.iso to my new data partition (which will be my /home):\nsudo mkdir /mnt2\nsudo mount /dev/sda6 /mnt2\nsudo cp /mnt/recovery.iso /mnt2/\n\n\n*Unmount the partitions:\nsudo umount /mnt\nsudo umount /mnt2\n\nInstall Ubuntu\nUse the \"other\" (advanced) partitioning mode. Select /dev/sdb2 as the / partition in ext4, and /dev/sda6 (or adapt to yours) as the /home partition. Make sure the bootloader is installed on /dev/sda (since it seems /dev/sdb is not recognized at boot by the BIOS).\nEnjoy!\n\nA: Anup,\nDid you format the \"shrunk\" partition?\nTry to install using an .iso image burned to a cd/dvd.\nPerhaps you can try to run the Gparted utility that is packed with the Ubuntu live cd and see the format of your hard disk.  \nHope this helps.\n\nA: When installing ubuntu you can chosse the option \"SOMETHING ELSE\" this will open the ubuntu partition editor \"gparted\". You then need 3 partitions 1 about 30 to 50 gig mounted on / formatted as EXT4 another about 5 gig as a \"LINUX SWAP\" partition an finally format any free space as EXT4 and mount as /home make sure you format all these partitions but not your windows ones obviusly and you cant format your swap.\nThis is the best set up as if you have any problems you can re install ubuntu to / and save all your file in /home to do this just tick the format box for the / partition and leave the rest as is.\nThere are many tutorials for this online if you dont understand just search \"best way to prtition a hdd for ubuntu\".\nHope this solves your problem. \n\nA: Just make an empty partition (make sure it says \"unallocated space\" in Windows's Disk Management utility), then boot Ubuntu from an USB or CD, doesn't matter, and just chose Install along side Windows. Ubuntu will use the unallocated space to install Ubuntu and you will dual boot Ubuntu with Windows.\n\nA: When installing first go to try ubuntu live from the CD or the USB. \nOpen a terminal and enter the command\ndmraid -E -r /dev/sdX where the X is your SSD drive. \nYou can know which is the SSD by typing fdisk -l and searching for the SSD in the output. \nAfter this your installer should be able to find all the necessary drives. \n", "Q: Recover a folder through Ubuntu One I had a folder (a backup of my Wii homebrew actually) synced with Ubuntu One.  Unfortunately, I ran out of space on my hard drive, so I disabled Ubuntu One sync for a while and deleted the folder off the hard drive.\nMonths later, I have space again and would like the folder back.  I can see it though Firefox, but I see no way to download it except by downloading individual files myself through Firefox, and in this case the dense folder trees are almost as important as the files themselves.\nIs there a way to tell Ubuntu One to re-download the folder to my Precise install?  Or do I have to wait until they implement this feature in the Web UI?\n(No, it's not in my trash, and it was too long ago to use extundelete.)\n\nA: If your \"new space\" is the result of a new install on a larger hard disk, and you haven't synchronized with U1 on that install yet, then simply logging into U1 there should result in everything under the ~/Ubuntu One folder being downloaded again, and if they were in a separate folder which you synchronized, you simply have to select in the control panel to have that folder synchronized again.\nIf on the other hand, it is the same install you were using before, and you simply disconnected/uninstalled Ubuntu One, then deleted the folder/files in question, the files may be deleted from the server if you just log in and start syncing again. In this case, I'd recommend running these commands in a terminal:\n$: u1sdtool -q\n$: pkill -9 ubuntuone\n$: mv ~/.local/share/ubuntuone/syncdaemon ~/.local/share/ubuntuone/syncdaemon.old\n$: u1sdtool -c\n\nThis will stop ubuntuone-syncdaemon, move the metadata out of the way, and restart ubuntuone-syncdaemon and connect. When connected, it should just re-download everything, and if you have any conflicting files in ~/Ubuntu One, or other synchronized folders, create conflict files for them.\nIf neither of these solutions work, and the files do end up getting deleted from the Web UI view, then ensure the client is fully synchronized with the server (all synchronized folders have the same files and those files are the same in both places), then open a support ticket at https://one.ubuntu.com/help/contact to get more help.\n\nA: I modified your solution a little bit, dobey, and used a solution from an alternate thread's answer.  Here is what I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*Stopped the Ubuntu One syncdaemon with: u1sdtool -q\n\n*Deleted what appears to be the download cache/Ubuntu One temp folder? with: sudo rm -rf ~/.local/share/ubuntuone\n\n*Started the  Ubuntu One syncdaemon again with: u1sdtool -c\nThis seems to have returned some other folders as well, but without the files that were in them because I deleted them before the folders.  Interesting how it behaves...  I think I'll clean up from the Web UI.\n", "Q: How to move flash video window to the primary display? How can I move my flashplayer video (fullscreen) to my primary monitor? I'm using Kubuntu 12.04 and two displays.\nDidn't find anything with Google. If you need more info let me know.\n\nA: This problem is unsovled since ages.

How do you run any command in Unity, similar to \"Run command\" (ALT-F2) from Gnome?\n\nA: It's exactly the same - Alt + F2.\n", "Q: How to reset the Xorg / xserver? Xserver keeps crashing on my general user account both in Unity 3D and 2D.\nIt doesn't do it on the guest account.\nThat's why I want to reset / rollback everything xserver related, hoping this is going to fix it.\nMost answers on this involve sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg. However, this does nothing for me (generates no output) and I read in other forums, that it's deprecated.\nSo, what's the current way to reset all xserver / xorg options; what's the alternative to sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg? X crashes during work, not before login or so. And the effect of a crash is, that I get thrown out of the session, not a freeze or machine crash.\n\nA: The alternative to sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg is  sudo X -configure\n\nA: To reconfigure packages that are already installed, you can refer to:\nUbuntu Manpage: dpkg-reconfigure - reconfigure an already installed package\nUsing the terminal:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you've got to a blank screen while booting up, press CTRL + ALT + F1 to access the terminal.\nThen, depending on your desktop environment, terminate the X using:\n\n\n*\n\n*For Gnome (Ubuntu): sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop\n\n*For KDE (Kubuntu): sudo /etc/init.d/kdm stop\n\n*For Xfce (Xubuntu): sudo /etc/init.d/xdm stop\n\n\n*For the reconfiguration process:\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg\n\nNote: A backup is always recommended before running the configuration, so you can do it using:\nsudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup\n\n\n*Restart the GUI:\nAgain, this depends on the desktop environment, so:\n\n\n*\n\n*For Gnome (Ubuntu): sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start\n\n*For KDE (Kubuntu): sudo /etc/init.d/kdm start\n\n*For Xfce (Xubuntu): sudo /etc/init.d/xdm start\n\nIf fail to perform the above steps, one can always edit the /etc/X11/xorg.conf manually and replace the file contents.\nRefer to:\n\n\n*\n\n*Binary package “xserver-xorg-core” in ubuntu lucid\n\n*examples and default linux configuration files\n\nA: If your guest account is not affected this could be a user-specific setting that is causing the problem. Try deleting ~/.config/monitors.xml\n\nA: After trying all you guys mentioned here I solved the very same problem by setting ownership (and permissions) of .Xauthority and .ICEauthority (located inside: /home/username/ folder) back to my general user.\nto check own/perm start tty1 (CTRL+ALT+1) and login, take superuser (sudo su) and:\ncd /home/username/\nls -a -l \n\nin my case .Xauthority wasn't even readable by my general user, so first I had to chmod:\nchmod 775 .Xauthority\n\nthen:\nchown username .Xauthority\nchown username .ICEauthority\n\nafter this, reboot and try to login -- it worked for me.\nAnother note: I faced this problem after iterative experiments with xorg.conf and NVidia drivers - trying to setup 3 monitors with 2 cards. So, I spent huge amount of time trying to solve the problem playing around xserver and video settings -- while the reason of crash was totally unrelated.\n", "Q: How to list user installed applications (not packages)? Not packages and not all applications. Just the applications user installed by himself from whatever source (Software Center, manually added PPA, etc.).\nIf the above is not possible - a list of all installed applications or at least a GUI which lists the applications so I can take screenshots of it.\nI've read a dozen of similar questions and people posting answers usually don't even get close to OP question merit. Please note that my question includes 'user installed'. \nAnswer:\nIt is not currently possible in Ubuntu Linux. \n(choosing tijybba's answer as the closest one though)\n\nA: You can actually use the Ubuntu Software Centre, as shown in the screenshot here:\n\nAlso you can see it in Synaptic Bottom left list selections.\nBy cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ && cat *.list you will get list of all repositories in your system. \nYou can also you Y PPA manager to backup and update your repositories.\n\n\nSecond Method\n\n[Since this method involves installing all the packages , but if we think that newly Installed OS will already have those 90 % packages , so it will ignore the present ones and install the new manually added ones , which will be only your manually installed applications]\nThis method from here.\nsudo dpkg --get-selections > installed-applications.txt\n\nit will generate a list of installed applications in txt file in home folder.\nTo use this file to install the same applications you will have to do ( But before this please also add all the Third party Repositories as was present in older one)\nsudo dpkg --set-selections < installed-applications.txt\nsudo apt-get -y update\nsudo apt-get dselect-upgrade\n\nThis is also possible through Gui way \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/mintbackup && sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install mintbackup\n\n\nI guess image almost speaks itself, backup your selection, then in New installation restore it.\n\nA: apt-mark showmanual will give you a list of \"manually installed\" packages. This includes packages installed by the installer, which is most of them. But if you run this after installation and compare the output again later, you'll get a list of packages which the user has specifically requested, excluding automatically installed dependencies.\nFor example:\n$ # Save the current list of manually installed packages\n$ apt-mark showmanual | sort > original-package-list\n\n# ...time passes...\n\n$ # Compare the old list with the current list\n$ # (this will output a list of packages that have been installed by the user since the last command)\n$ apt-mark showmanual | sort | comm -13 - original-package-list\n\nNote that applications are packages as far as Software Center and manually added PPAs are concerned. Differentiating between packages specifically requested and packages brought in to satisfy dependencies is I think the best you can do.\nOr to just see a list of all packages installed, run dpkg-query -W -f'${PackageSpec}\\n'.\n\nA: only root can install packages under Ubuntu, the user that can do that is just only 1, the sudoers are just user with equivalent rights.\nHowever you can get a lot of information looking at the logs, you can look at\nthe apt log under /var/log/apt/\nthe dpkg log under /var/log/\nand you can get the list of the installed packages with just a command:\ndpkg -l | grep ii\n\n\nA: Actually, per your question I see that this following command does what you need dpkg -l | grep ii.  This listed every installed package as it should for me.  Now it does not say user A or user B but again this is a limitation not of sudo but of software center logs.  EVEN using sudo the user who called sudo is passed so you could still have any app log who called sudo to run a command.  Now of course you can get around this rather easily because part of sudo is the ability to login as any user [who has access to sudo] if you know their password, hack it, or change it if you have those rights on the system.\nIf you are concerned about what a user has installed in that it may put you or your system at risk you may want to review why you gave them sudo access and along with that the ability to install packages, but that's just a side note.\nI have a feeling you are asking for yourself which packages you have installed since system install so you can either clean up or mirror the setup to a new machine.  Answers here already cover the backup/restore so we'll skip that.\nSince there is no easy straight forward way to find which user called the install of a package a better approach may be to use the command as listed both above and by another user to list all installed packages and have a browser window open to Google and run Google searched to figure out which packages are required to keep your system operational and which ones are not.\nSkip to here to skip most of the fluff and get to the answer more directly...\nYou could also review your sudoers logs to see who called for the install of what let me give an example line\nMay 15 11:26:30 <COMPUTERNAME> sudo:   <user who called sudo> : TTY=unknown ; PWD=/home/pariah (pwd file or auth method used to verify user) ; USER=root (User they were running as) ; COMMAND=/usr/bin/thunar (the command they ran)\n\nSo this tells me at this time and date this user called for a sudo [actually in this case gksu was used btw], what user sudo let them have permissions as and the big one the command they ran!\nNow if you were to grep for apt-get or similar within the sudo log \n[/var/log/auth.log] and older ones will have .0 .1 etc appended to the end.\nYou could piece together which installs the user called for on the command line itself.  If they used software-center I am not sure if the relevant terminal command would get an auth line here, but you get to use the software center logs found at:\n/var/log/apt/history.log and older logs are in .gz compressed archives\nNow the software center log does not provide the user who authed the installs as far as I have ever seen within that log, but it lists EVERY add, modify, or remove software center performs.  Again this log also has time and date stamps as well so easy enough to find ackages after base system install go to oldest log go to top or if you remember the time and date of when the base install completed and you are good to go.\nBoth of those log files mentioned are in plaintext and you can use any gedit, mousepad, leafpad whatever text editor your Ubuntu flavor uses for it's default to view and or print them.\n", "Q: Fastest way to put a lot of files togheter into 1 big chunk I want to avoid the creation of an archive because it takes a significant amount of time and CPU power, since i have to transfer a big folder among different filesystem i would like to have all the data in just 1 file.\n\nA: You need tar. Read the funny manpage:-) tar does not compress (unless you tell it to).\ntar cf tarname.tar the_directory_you_want_to_archive/ will create one file: tarname.tar. You can extract with tar xf tarname.tar later.\nIf the files you wish to archive reside in different directories, simply add each one to the command line like so: tar cf tarname.tar dir1/file1 dir2/file2 dir3/file3. This will create an archive containing the files 'file1', 'file2' and 'file3'.\n\nA: In all of the ,buntus, I always install 7z file compression. It is freeware, and can handle RAR compression if you need it.  Best of all, it is a Graphic User Interface program, so nO fAnCy CoMmaNd lInE fussiness and intolerance.\nBoth ZIP & 7Z file compression are recognized by most operating systems. TAR, etc tends to be just Unix-type operating systems. 7Z also compresses to smaller file sizes. The 'time' compressing is small, compared to the transfer-time to another computer or storage drive.\n", "Q: How to use gsettings from /opt I have to use gsettings from /opt so that ubuntu maintainers will accept my application.\nI may not use /usr or any of the underlying directories so /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas is not an option.\n\nA: Did you try quickly?\nquickly package --extras\n\nThis will use the /opt directory.\n\nA: I solved this by creating a wrapper script :\nGSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR=~/.local/share/glib-2.0/schemas /opt/my_app_dir/my_app\n", "Q: Amnesia running very slowly So I installed Amnesia The Dark Descent and everything seemed fine until I made it to making a profile and starting screen. It ran very slowly and I couldn't even move the mouse and had to restart the computer. Maybe it's about my graphics card ? I have a nVidia Corporation MCP61 High Definition Audio graphics card.. Thanks ! :)\n\nA: Okay, you probably mixed something up there. \"nVidia Corporation MCP61 High Definition Audio\" isn't a graphics card but your sound card. What graphics card you really have is displayed in the \"system details\" panel. Just type \"details\" into the dash and it should show up.\nIf you do have a nvidia or AMD graphics card you probably haven't installed the right graphics driver.

When trying to rip a DVD, it freezes after 30 minutes.\n\nWhen I try to transcode a small part of the dvd, \n\nI get this error.\n\n\nA: That might be a bug in the software. Have you tried using a different application? I use Handbrake and have only had good experiences so far. (They don't have a dev for 12.04 yet, but the 11.10 version works perfectly on 12.04.)\nIf your DVD is copy protected Handbrake will most likely also fail.

what the error means or how to correct it.\nThanks!\n\nA: To automatically convert all files in a folder from MKV to MP4 you can create an alias:\nalias mkv2mp4=\"for f in ./**/*.mkv; do ffmpeg -n -i \\\"\\$f\\\" -c copy \\\"\\${f%.mkv}.mp4\\\" && rm \\\"\\$f\\\"; done\"\n\nThis command performs the following steps:\n\n*\n\n*Recursively loops through the current directory looking for .mkv files\n\n*Converts each file & all its sources to .mp4, not overwriting (-n) existing files\n\n*Removes the source file when the conversion was successful\n\n\nA: As I've already written here, I suggest you change a few details in your command line:\n\n\n*\n\n*If you're using an Ubuntu release older than 15.04, replace ffmpeg for avconv, as it was the fork used by Ubuntu for a few years (see the comments)\n\n*Do you really need -absf aac_adtstoasc? It had some issues that may not have been corrected in current Ubuntu's ffmpeg. I suggest you to try without it first.\n\n*-vcodec copy -acodec copy can be simplified to -codec copy or -c copy. It would also prevent tampering other streams besides video and audio, like subtitles.\n\n\nSo the winner is...\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c copy output.m4v\n\nIf that does not work, please post all terminal output.\n\nA: I know its a very old thread, but I've found a solution to successfully run ffmpeg. Don't use -vcodec copy -acodec copy, use just ffmpeg -i input.mkv output.m4v instead. It will start running.\nBut in my case, I convert a .mkv to .mp4, the result output is just trash. It losses frame accuracy.\n\nA: there is already an answer about this How to convert .mkv file into .mp4 file losslessly?\nthe basic concept is that both the MKV and the MP4 are containers, they are just containers, you basically have to unpack and re-pack the audio and video tracks if you want to switch between the two.\n\nA: Got this on Xubuntu 14.04 when trying to burn a DVD of MP4s using DVDStyler; Bombono produces the same error. ffmpeg #1154 suggests this might have been fixed in ffmpeg, though perhaps not in avconv? libav #478 is still marked open.\nAlso see: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/127522/avconv-error-av-interleaved-write-frame\nI filed Launchpad #1339980; in summary, use a current release of ffmpeg, and not avconv.\n\nA: Try This one:: Libav in Linux\nInstallation: run command  \nsudo apt-get install libav-tools\n\nVideo conversion command::Go to folder contains the video and run in terminal\navconv -i oldvideo.mkv -ar 22050 convertedvideo.mp4\n\n", "Q: Does VirtualBox permanently affect performance? I would like to install VirtualBox as an Ubuntu testing environment. Must I permanently sacrifice system resources such as RAM? Or only when the environment is running?\n\nA: *\n\n*You must sacrifice some disk space when you install it.\n\n*And a minor part of RAM, as it loads additional kernel modules.\n\n\nNothing more, as long as the app is not running.\nThe ressources you assign to a virtual machine are different:\n\n\n*\n\n*of course its virtual disks/storages will be there until you delete that VM and its files\n\n*the RAM assigned to the VM will only be used when you fire up the VM and should be freed once you power it down.\n\n*Same for the RAM VirtualBox itself uses to run, which should be freed when you exit the VirtualBox application itself.\n\n\nA: The most common bottleneck, in my experience, is the HDD and/or the memory controller.\nThere will be more space allocated in the RAM, that's for sure, but the big problem is that your HDD and your memory controller have to work double times for 2 OS, doesn't matter if the 1 OS is virtualized, it still have to access a phisical device somewhere to read and write data.\nIf you have a chance to install and use another HDD, use this one to store all the data about your VM, having 2 HDD will make everything run smoother.\n\nA: If the guest is Linux, there is one option not mentioned often that may improve speed a lot if meet the requirements.\nYou can tell VirtualBox to use a USB disk inside the guest, and if the guest is a Linux system, it can use such a disk for root, though maybe not for boot (VBox refuses to boot from USB).\nAlso you can tell VBox to use such a disk as RAW (warning: with host accessing the disk at same time, if host is Windows you had better set disk as offline). I dislike this a lot; I prefer to pass a USB drive.\nBut ensure the USB drive is fast (better if an SSD) and USB is 3.x (better if 3.1 Gen2), USB 2.0 is a real bottle neck.\nIn this way the Linux guest will control the real hardware (through USB pass) and that can make the guest really smooth.\nAlso think about using Linux Live systems (that run full in RAM), but have plenty of RAM (like 32GiB/64GiB/128GiB/256GiB/.../1TiB of RAM on Host).\nNothing actually beats RAM speed.\n\nMy configuration is a 128GiB AMD ThreadRipper 1950X (16 cores/32 threads) with 128GiB of DDR4 and eigth 120GiB SSD (each 500MiB/s) in LVM2 (stripped).\nOn boot the Linux system copies its 2GiB Host Linux into RAM (from an SSD like RAID 0 in less than two seconds), then host is running fully from RAM, then I copy the Guest disks to RAM drive (64GiB copied on less than nine seconds) and then I run VBox and start the Guest, and the guest disks are fully on RAM.\nSo all (host and guest) runs with all disk storages on RAM (faster disk access while running is impossible with any physical disk).\nI know, I allow only 30GiB for host and guest as RAM, for host I give 6GiB and guest 24 GiB.\nSo my 128GiB are used as this (number with * indicate approximated):\n\n\n*\n\n*2GiB* of RAM Drive for Linux host (disk to ram boot)\n\n*6GiB of RAM as host RAM (for host system and apps)\n\n*64GIB of RAM Drive for Guest virtual (fised size) disk\n\n*128MiB of RAM for guest video memory\n\n*24GiB of RAM for guest RAM\n\n*Total: 128GiB\n\n\nI know having 128GiB lets me do good things.\nI should mention that using this setup my Guest is immutable unless I save from RAM drive the disk image back to the SSDs.\nAlso note SSDs are used only at boot time, and only at shutdown if I want to save changes, while on boot they are used for only around 12 seconds (yes, you read correctly, less than a quarter of a minute), and if I want to save the changes on powerdown they are used for only nine seconds.\nSince I have it on powerdown each night, my SSDs are used on read only 12 seconds per day, and on write only 9 seconds per day (not all days).\nAlso note that all reads/writes are for files with sizes (near 2GiB host Linux .ISO, like a small LiveDVD)+(64GiB of guest virtual fixed size disk), except Grub2 boot files, kernel and initramfs. So my main use of SSDs are for two non-fragmented files, one of near 2GiB, one of 64GiB.\nHaving a lot of RAM is really great (and such processor is brilliant), but expensive (near $3000).\nI could do it better if I were rich... use a Quad socket main board for AMD Epyc processors (each one costs $4000, so only the processors are $16000). I cannot afford such huge prices, but such a mainboard allows up to 1 TeraByte of DDR4 RAM... think what could I do with such a beast!\n", "Q: How do I save Updates/Installed Packages? So I've been messing with thing that probably shouldn't be messed with trying to learn my way around Linux, and I seem to have messed something up. I'm getting a lot of error messages, reduced speed, and crashes, so I'm going to do a clean install. \nHowever, I an using mobile broadband and don't exactly want to use all of it up again re-downloading updates.\nIs there any way I can save all the packages installed now with their updates to an external hard drive?\n\nA: For backup of all your GNU/Linux system, use Remastersys\nIt can make a full system backup including personal data to a live cd or dvd that you can use anywhere and install. It'll create a ISO image compressed.\nWhat happens with drivers?\nThings like the graphics card and other hardware will be configured and setup automatically and you do not have to use identical hardware. But there is a problem with the Nvidia and AMD proprietary drivers so they will not be available on the live system and will need to be reinstalled after installation of your custom system.\nSize of ISO\nThe maximum single file size for the ISO to be set at 4GB which means the entire compressed.\nWhere I can burn?\nThe ISO can be easily backed up to a dvd or external portable drive and copied back afterwards.\n\nFor save only your updates:\nSave all the package, files located in /var/cache/apt/archives. And do a backup of the repository indexes, files located in /var/lib/apt/lists.\nNow in the other computer launch Synaptic and select: File->Add Package Downloaded\n\nThen search the folder were you put the files and open it, accept all. With your repository indexes you will not have dependency problems.\n", "Q: Root tasks using dbus and policykit At some point my application needs to do administrative tasks like creating a file in /etc or running commands with root priveleges.\nI know just could do a Q&D:\nos.popen(\"pkexec foo bar\")\n\nBut I also know that this is not the foreseen clean way to do it. Some kind of annoying for the user because he always needs to reenter his password instead of having a session-like handling.\nI was very optimistic as I found the python example for authenticating.\nIt's a simple example which works immediatly:\nimport dbus\n\nbus = dbus.SystemBus()\nproxy = bus.get_object('org.freedesktop.PolicyKit1', '/org/freedesktop/PolicyKit1/Authority')\nauthority = dbus.Interface(proxy,  dbus_interface='org.freedesktop.PolicyKit1.Authority')\n\nsystem_bus_name = bus.get_unique_name()\n\nsubject = ('system-bus-name', {'name' : system_bus_name})\naction_id = 'org.freedesktop.policykit.exec'\ndetails = {}\nflags = 1            # AllowUserInteraction flag\ncancellation_id = '' # No cancellation id\n\nresult = authority.CheckAuthorization(subject, action_id, details, flags, cancellation_id)\n\nprint result\n\nI've been quite naive thinking that after authorization I could just go on in the script with some os.popen()-commands. Now I know better :(\nI can see the tuple-result in the example above, but in the further documentation I could not find a working code to go on at this point.\nWhat do I have to do with this result? How can I go on performing the tasks I need? Is there a python reference with examples that offer the available methods?\nI tried to list the methods of authorization by using dir() but could not find any clue how to go on.\nI really want to avoid using my fallback but it would be my last resort. Please help me doing it the right way :)\nThanks and regards\nAndré\nEdit:\nDue I did not bring this to work and my former solution by starting my program with gksu does not work out of /opt/, I finally had to give up and implement a thousand asks for password to make the program rudimentary work to get at least a T-Shirt in the app showdown. \nI did not notice the problem because I first did a quickly share. There everything worked right. Asking once for the password at the beginning. I'm totally down now. My  contribution for AppShowdown was https://launchpad.net/armorforge. ;-(\n\nA: There's a fundamental concept you need to grasp first: PolicyKit only handles authorisation, not privilege escalation. PolicyKit will answer the question: \"is the user authorised to do this task?\", but it will not give you root privileges.\nThe commonly-used model is to create a DBus system service, which runs with root privileges. It will take requests from non-root processes, use PolicyKit to determine whether that process is authorised to make that request, and then do the task requested.\nI wrote a tutorial on PolicyKit and DBus with Python on ubuntuforums.org a few years back. The principles are the same, although it might need some updating. I need to go to bed now, so have a look and let me know if it needs updating.\n", "Q: All of my Google Chrome extensions have stopped working on Ubuntu and Windows I have noticed that my Google Chrome extensions are no longer working on Ubuntu or Windows, and the context menu of each extension is no longer showing up.

Later when I have a better internet connection, I'll use Lubuntu, but this was quicker. I have a PowerMac G5 dual Core, with the default graphics card, the Radeon 9600. Great for low shaders, however I cannot seem to get the driver working. For starters, when I click on \"Additional Drivers\" within the System Settings, it flashes a window, appears in the launcher, then disappears.

It only has HDD, LAN and FDD. \nI can't figure out a way to boot from my USB... Could I somehow use GRUB?\n\nA: What you are going to do is install Plop Boot manager. Plop boot manager is a small program that allows you to boot from all of your computers available devices, including a USB, even if your BIOS doesn't support it. Download the Plop boot manager ISO from here. Be sure to choose the right version of Plop boot manager. If you are unsure about choosing the 32-bit version or the 64-bit version, choose the 32-bit version. Now, you need to configure Grub2 to boot from the ISO file you downloaded. In a terminal, run gksudo gedit /etc/grub.d/40_custom. Paste in the following text below the exec tail line.\nCode:\nmenuentry \"Plop Linux ISO\" {\n    echo Loading Plop Linux\n    set isofile=\"/iso/ploplinux-4.2.2.iso\"\n    loopback loop $isofile\n    linux (loop)/syslinux/kernel/bzImage vga=1 iso_filename=$isofile\n    initrd (loop)/syslinux/kernel/initramfs.gz\n\n}\nReplace /iso/ploplinux-4.2.2.iso the the location of your downlaoded ISO file.

Since I'd hate to boot up into Windows just to use Photoshop, I'm trying to get it in Ubuntu 12.04.\nTutorials I found suggested that the easiest way to have it in Ubuntu was to install Wine, and copy my Windows installation over. \nHere are the exact steps I've done up to this point.\nFrom Windows, exported the registry key for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE >> SOFTWARE >> Adobe to the desktop.  \nChanged to Ubuntu, downloaded Wine from Software Center\nTerminal:\n$ sudo apt-get install wine ttf-mscorefonts-installer\n$ winecfg\n$ wget http://www.kegel.com/wine/winetricks\n$ sh winetricks msxml6 gdiplus gecko vcrun2005sp1 vcrun2008 msxml3 atmlib \nMoved registry export to home folder.\nCopied\n\"Program Files (x86)\\Adobe\" to \"~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Adobe\"\n\"Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\\Adobe\" to \"~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/Common Files/Adobe\" \n\"Documents and Settings\\Don\\Application Data\\Adobe\" to \"~/.wine/drive_c/users/don/Application Data/Adobe\"  \n\"Windows\\System32\\odbcint.dll\" to \"~/.wine/drive_c/windows/system32/odbcint.dll\" ,and lastly  \n\"Windows\\System32\\odbc32.dll\" to \"~/.wine/drive_c/windows/system32/odbc32.dll\".\nFrom Terminal, $ wine regedit adobe.reg.\nRight clicked on Photoshop.exe and selected \"Open with Wine\".\nGot the message \"Wine Program Crash, Internal errors - invalid parameters received.\"\nSo to restate my question, How can I get Photoshop running in Ubuntu 12.04?

I have already installed all the 265 updates from the Ubuntu software center and downloaded Deluge from there. My hardrive is 80GB according to the disc usage analyzer. It also says 31.2 GB used and 47.8GB free. The confusion comes when I run Deluge. At the bottom it says 2.0GB free space. Is that 2.0GB just a size set from the torrent client and can be changed or am I limited to just that 2.0GB? \n\nA: The Free Space statusbar values are calculated from the partition containing the Download to directory, specified in Preferences. \n", "Q: Will I loose my data from windows if I import my account to Ubuntu 12.04 I'm installing Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and right now it's importing my only account from Windows 7.\nI'm wondering: Is it just copying and pasting my account, or is it removing my account from Windows completely, so it will only be in Ubuntu?\n\nA: It only copies your stuff over, nothing deleted.\n", "Q: Can I install Ubuntu Server alongside Windows? I am wondering if its possible to install ubuntu server side by side with windows, and I don't want it to touch it. Is possible, i know it is on the desktop version but not sure for the server. The version is the one currently downloaded as of today the July 4 2012\nThanks.\n\nA: Ubuntu Server and Ubuntu Desktop are different just because they have different packages installed by default. See this for explanation.\nSo, you can turn Desktop to Server or turn Server to Desktop whenever you want.\nIn your case, you should give one or several partitions for Ubuntu Server installation, and install the Ubuntu Server. The installer will detect other OS's on your computer and add entries for them automatically in GRUB2 boot loader.\nThus, you can boot into Windows or Ubuntu Server every time you power on your machine.\n\nA: The Windows-based Ubuntu Installer (Wubi) will not work with Ubuntu Server, but a traditional \"dual-boot\" installation -- which involves partitioning your hard disk appropriately -- will work just fine.\n", "Q: How to use media buttons for mplayer? How can I use my laptop's media buttons [Play/Pause, Next, Previous] to work with Mplayer? The XF86 buttons I think they're called.\n\nA: Create a named pipe like this:\nmkfifo ~/.mplayer/pipe\nThen, put the following line in ~/.mplayer/config:\ninput=file=/home/<username>/.mplayer/pipe\nor you can run mplayer with input argument:\nmplayer -input file=/home/<username>/.mplayer/pipe\nNow use System Setting->Keyboard->Shortcut and add a shortcut with the command parameter as (see mplayer -input cmdlist for the command list):\necho \"<mplayer command>\" > /home/<username>/.mplayer/pipe\ne.g. echo \"pt_step 1\" > /home/<username>/.mplayer/pipe for next track.\nand then assign a key to this shortcut.\n", "Q: Playback on Mythbuntu with nvidia graphic adapter is showing moderate tearing, and doesn't cover Unity Since upgrading to Mythbunu 12.04 and Mythtv 0.25, my playback has been showing tearing and also the Unity top panel plus the Unity Launcher overlay the screen.\nIs there a way to fix this?\n\nA: You might want to consider openbox.\nIt's a bit hacky to set up, and not as \"cool\" as unity, but you can get a very low-resource desktop with all the important features, like application indicators\nFor a very basic, but full-featured desktop:\nsudo apt-get install openbox lxpanel lxpanel-indicator-applet-plugin obconf lxpappearance\nThis will pull in some gtk2 packages and other dependencies, but not too much.\nAlso, gedit does make a backup. It makes a new file with a tilde; ie xorg.conf~\nBe aware, each time you save a file this backup will be overwritten with a new backup.\n\nA: After trying some suggestions about turning off compositing, I finally discovered how to do it so it stays off.\nNote this only works for Mythtv or for a desktop where you don't need or want compositing, and uses nvidia (as far as I know).\nFirst, run Unity in 2D ⋯ this makes the Unity stuff overlaying the playback go away. \nTo do this, when you log on, press the gear like button on the login screen and select Unity 2D.  If you bypass the startup login, you can log out and then to this when you log back in.\nSecond, turn off compositing in the xorg.conf file.\nThis is how:\nOpen a terminal and type in…\nsudo nano -B /etc/X11/xorg.conf\n\nThe move the pointer to the end of the file and type in these three lines:\nSection \"Extensions\"\n    Option \"Composite\" \"Disable\"\nEndSection\n\nCtrl-O and <enter> to save the changes, then Ctrl-X to close.  Note that with the -B option, nano will save a backup copy as xorg.conf~\nThen restart the X server or reboot.\nIf you are nervous about using the terminal to edit, you can use the text editor, gedit.\nOpen a terminal and type in gksu gedit.  After putting in your password, you can edit system files,  Be careful...!\nUse the open command to open Filesystem: /etc/X11/xorg.conf and add the lines to the bottom of the file. Update: gedit does make a \"~\" appended backup file  \nNow, enjoy your Mythtv...!\n\nIf there is still tearing, one more thing you can do...\nEdit your xorg.conf as above, this time adding a line at the end of the Section \"Device\"\nAdd this line:\n    Option         \"TripleBuffer\" \"1\"\n\nIt now should look a lot like my HTPC xorg.conf file:\nSection \"ServerLayout\"\n    Identifier     \"Layout0\"\n    Screen      0  \"Screen0\" 0 0\n# commented out by update-manager, HAL is now used and auto-detects devices\n# Keyboard settings are now read from /etc/default/console-setup\n#    InputDevice    \"Keyboard0\" \"CoreKeyboard\"\n# commented out by update-manager, HAL is now used and auto-detects devices\n# Keyboard settings are now read from /etc/default/console-setup\n#    InputDevice    \"Mouse0\" \"CorePointer\"\n    Option         \"Xinerama\" \"0\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Files\"\n    FontPath        \"unix/:7100\"\nEndSection\n\n# commented out by update-manager, HAL is now used and auto-detects devices\n# Keyboard settings are now read from /etc/default/console-setup\n#Section \"InputDevice\"\n#    # generated from default\n#    Identifier     \"Mouse0\"\n#    Driver         \"mouse\"\n#    Option         \"Protocol\" \"auto\"\n#    Option         \"Device\" \"/dev/psaux\"\n#    Option         \"Emulate3Buttons\" \"no\"\n#    Option         \"ZAxisMapping\" \"4 5\"\n#EndSection\n\n# commented out by update-manager, HAL is now used and auto-detects devices\n# Keyboard settings are now read from /etc/default/console-setup\n#Section \"InputDevice\"\n#    # generated from default\n#    Identifier     \"Keyboard0\"\n#    Driver         \"kbd\"\n#EndSection\n\nSection \"Monitor\"\n    # HorizSync source: edid, VertRefresh source: edid\n    Identifier     \"Monitor0\"\n    VendorName     \"Unknown\"\n    ModelName      \"SAMSUNG\"\n    HorizSync       26.0 - 81.0\n    VertRefresh     24.0 - 75.0\n    Option         \"DPMS\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Device\"\n    Identifier     \"Device0\"\n    Driver         \"nvidia\"\n    VendorName     \"NVIDIA Corporation\"\n    BoardName      \"GeForce GT 240\"\n    Option         \"TripleBuffer\" \"1\"\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Screen\"\n    Identifier     \"Screen0\"\n    Device         \"Device0\"\n    Monitor        \"Monitor0\"\n    DefaultDepth    24\n    Option         \"TwinView\" \"0\"\n    Option         \"metamodes\" \"DFP: nvidia-auto-select +0+0\"\n    SubSection     \"Display\"\n        Depth       24\n    EndSubSection\nEndSection\n\nSection \"Extensions\"\n    Option \"Composite\" \"Disable\"\nEndSection\n\nGood luck...!\n", "Q: Nvidia problems. I think. Let me start off by saying, I've been trying to run Ubuntu on my custom PC for about 2 years. From 10.04 to 12.04, this problem persists. \nWhen I try to boot Ubuntu from either a USB stick or a CD, I see the normal Ubuntu splash screen. It looks like it's working, orange dots are moving, but then the screen glitches and freezes.\nI'm assuming this happens because there are no drivers for my graphics card (Nvidia GeForce 8800, I think). My motherboard has no onboard graphics, nor does it have a VGA out. \nSo, how can I get this working on my system? Can I somehow put the drivers along side the .img on the USB stick?\nI can boot from my Ubuntu USB stick on my MacBook. In case that helps anyone...\n\nA: I dont think that gpu is up to running unity try xubuntu or lubuntu they are the same os but with diffrent desktops.\nor try one of the many lightwaight linux distros like puppy linux etc\nthere are millions of distros on google or www.distrowatch.com has many reviews\nsorry if that dose not help much but its worth a try just so you know your exact problem.\n\nA: I had a similar issue with the same graphics card years ago. The fix turned out to be pretty simple; as your pc boots, press escape to get into the Grub menu. Once there, hit e to edit the highlighted boot option. Add nomodeset after or in place of the words quiet splash. That should get your card to work. If that doesn't do it, repeat the steps to get into Grub. This time, select the Recovery option instead. Choose run is safe graphics. Hopefully that'll get you sorted out.\n", "Q: The Bumblebee daemon has not been started yet or the socket path /var/run/bumblebee.socket was incorrect I have recently installed Ubuntu 12.04 in a Intel Ivy Bridge with integrated graphics and NVidia GPU with Optimus tech, however i cant manage it to work properly.

The Asus is plugged into my graphics card's primary monitor slot and is the better monitor even though it is VGA but my computer defaults to the Dell. This happens when I boot as well; the loading screens, the motherboard brand image, etc. are all displayed on the Dell monitor until Windows loads.

(My previous installation of 10.04 crashed and I want to install 12.04, and back up some data before that).\nWhen I try to copy files from the mounted disk to the external one, I get the following error:\nThere was an error copying the file into /media/New Volume/L300_Bkp_2012_06_04/pics\nError opening file: Permission denied\n\nIs this related to the source(mounted hard disk) or the target (external disk)?\nHow do I get around this?\n\nA: This is mostly related to the mounted hard disk. You can try these to workaround the problem.\nUsing root power.\nPress Alt+F2 to bring dash command prompt. In that window, type gksudo nautilus. This will open nautilus with root permission. Then you can copy the files safely. Remember to close the root powered nautilus after the work finished, also do only what you wanted to copy.\nTake ownership of the mounted file system\nIf the above method does not work, You can use this.\nOpen a terminal, and type sudo chown user:user /media/New\\ Volume to take ownership of the file system. Then copy the files and reboot. Please note, it is only recommended, if the above method does not work.\nHope this will solve the problem\n( Credit: This thread )\n\nA: The problem appears to be the target: /media/New\\ Volume  but may equally be the source if the permissions are set to not allow read access (default is usually to allow read but nothing else)\nI don't recommend that you use gksudo nautilus if the source file system is damaged in any way - I've seen (or rather helped people recover) systems with command line which couldn't be done with Nautilus because it still had permissions problems for some reason.\nI also don't recommend that you take ownership of either file system while booted off the CD.  The username will ubuntu, or root if you use sudo.  I also recommend that you do NOT write to the source file system (with chown, nautilus, or otherwise) if there's any chance it is damaged.  If there's a problem it will make it worse.\nInstead, just copy the data from the source (presumably the first internal disk or partition) to the external drive mounted on media, obviously /media/New\\ Volume\nTo mount the first internal disk/partition using command line:\n  sudo mount /dev/sda1/ /mnt\n\nwhere sda is the first physical hard drive and the partition in question and (1) is the first partition on it.\nYour data will then be accessible as /mnt/home/username unless you had a separate partition for /home\nAssuming that your external drive has automounted at /media/New\\ Volume and you have already made the directory L300_Bkp_2012_06_04 on it you can copy all of your home directory with the following command:\n   sudo cp -rv /mnt/home/username/* /media/New\\ Volume/L300_Bkp_2012_06_04/\n\nIf the external backup drive is formatted FAT then you will have no permissions problems when you come to copy the data back to your re-installed system.  If the external drive is ext4 then the backup files and directories will belong to root and you may need to take ownership of them before you can copy them.

Hey guys I'm a new linux user, I figured it would be the best for the laptop I just purchased because it's said to be faster than Windows 7. I'm currently dual-booting with Windows 7 Professial and Ubuntu 12.04. \nThe laptop I am using is the LG X Note P210\nSpecs:\nIntel Core i5 470UM Dual Core clocked at 1.33GHz\n12.5\" HD LED LCD Screen at 1366 by 768\n4GB DDR3 @ 1333 MHz RAM\nIntegrated Intel HD Graphics Card\n4 Cell Battery with 3150mAh\nIt comes loaded Windows 7 Home Premium 64-Bit, it runs fine on that but my Ubuntu 12.04 runs slower than it and I don't understand why, it definitely has decent specs to run even a 64-bit operating system and do some gaming. Granted I know it's not the best but for a laptop it does the job so Ubuntu should work especially since it's said to make older units with worse specs run even better.\nI'm not all that familiar with coding and all so what are things I can do to optimize speed without overclocking? Boot up is fine, its program response time I believe, once Im in the actual OS, it lags, slows down, apps stop working, take forever to load up apps.\n\nA: Your slowness may be due to the fact that you are using Intel HD Graphics.\n Linux does not have very good 3D graphics support for Intel Chips. Also, in 12.04, Compiz eats a lot of memory. Use a 64 bit Ubuntu with either Gnome 3 or Cinnamon desktop for graphics effects. They use less amount of memory than compiz. Or if you want, you can use Unity-2D, faster with no 3D effects. 32bit Ubuntu cannot use more than 2 GB of RAM. If you use 64 bit, Ubuntu will use 3.7GB of RAM\n\nA: I'm not really sure why people are still perpetuating the myth that Ubuntu is faster than Windows? The desktop used by Ubuntu - Unity - is every bit as much a beast as is Windows and requires quite a bit of processing power and memory.\nI have two suggestions for you:\n\n\n*\n\n*Install the 32bit Ubuntu. You only have 4GB of memory so you wont really be benefiting and this may be contributing to a slight slow-down.\n\n*Try an alternative desktop. There are a number of alternative desktops for Ubuntu. Because you only have Intel integrated graphics available, you may prefer to run something rather lighter. XFCE is a popular choice.\n\n\nYou can either install a version of Ubuntu specifically designed for XFCE - Xubuntu. Or you can install XFCE as an alternative desktop, see here for instructions.\n\nA: I installed the Lubuntu desktop to speed up my old laptop after finding Ubuntu 12.04 with Unity sluggish.\nNow there's a marked improvement in speed, I love it.\n\nA: I had similar experience with my Xubuntu 12.10 running on SSD, it was able to boot to the Xfce desktop within 8-10 sec from cold start, but somehow the boot time gets delayed to 1 ~ 2 minutes one day, I tried all different tweaks I googled but still without any luck.  however, the problems finally solved after I tried to clear & rebuild the font cache by the command: \"sudo fc-cache -fv\" I guess the broken font cache may have caused the problem during login.\n", "Q: Where are logs stored? AFAIK applications in Ubuntu track activity and errors beyond what is covered by the \"Privacy\" setting. (Including, for example, login/logout/shutdown times.)

I have 12.04 32bit installed on my hard drive. Ubuntu is the only OS. I recently installed it after getting rid of Windows 7. When I run Disk Utility under SMART Status it says \"disk has a few bad sectors\", so I clicked on View SMART data and run self tests. I run the extended SMART self-test and it only takes 5-10 seconds for it to stop and reads Self-Tests: FAILED (Read), Bad Sectors: 1 bad sector, Overall Disk Assessment: Disk has a few bad sectors. \n\nIs this something I should be worried about?\n\nA: At this point in time I wouldn't.  Hard Drive manufacturers, normally pack spare sectors in the drive just for situations like this.  Keep an eye on it, and always have a backup of your data handy.  Also I would suggest that you run the manufacturers diagnostic tool, and that can be acquired form the drive manufacturers website. Once you do that, and it gives you an error code, and providing htat the drive is still under warranty, then call the manufacturer,and get it replaced.\nImportant note to keep: Disks that start with 1 bad sector, will probably get worse.  I can't stress enough the importance of a backup.\n\nA: Be worried when \"pending\" bad sectors start showing up in SMART\nModern drives handle \"simple\" bad sectors automatically and transparently, by remapping them to one of the spare sectors allocated for this purpose without getting SMART's CURRENT_PENDING_SECTOR involved.\nOnce you see that value go above zero, it usually means one of two things:\n\n*\n\n*The drive has (or will soon) run out of the spare sectors, leaving the \"bad sector\" marked as unusable\n\n*The bad sector was not \"simple\", and could not be read/corrected in the first place even if there were plenty of spare sectors left.\nEither of those are not good for the future of your drive. You can check the exact errors by looking at the drive's internal log with smartmontools; use smartctl -l xerror /dev/sdN to get the extended error log (or -l error for the standard log).\nIf under warranty, and you have a spare drive/space to back the data up to, I would consider having this drive replaced ASAP.\n\nA: Way to give your HDD some more life\nOne thing I looked into a lot on the net and found out myself, is what to do when you start getting some \"bad sectors\", a problem I came across with my HDD which recently caused boot failure just out of nowhere and received the \"treatment\" I explain.\n1.Backup your data\n2.Try to give your HDD an orientation. I mean, tell ALL its little magnetic parts (sorry I am not an engineer) to have the same polarity (seems they get a little crazy after some overwrites...) Best and easiest way to do that is by a zerofill, which makes your entire disk like 000000000000..., but there are also some Windows apps like DRevitalize that do pretty much something like that in not so uniform a way (and without losing data supposingly-never tried it to be honest)\nYou can do a zerofill by a slow format (device, not just partition) in Ubuntu's Disks GUI, or through your terminal, using the \"shred\" command: sudo shred -n 0 -v -z /dev/sdX (where sdX the disk you want to erase) and probably in a million other ways, I don't think it matters that much how you do it.\nI tried a 2-pass zerofill on a disk with 250 bad sectors and 75 more \"pending\". It eliminated the \"pending\" sectors somehow and significantly improved access times for some 2500 more sectors, from \"<500ms\" to \"<150ms\" (surface test with HDDScan). I guess some of those would soon become \"bad\" and remains to see if I can expect a time gain of days, weeks or more...\n", "Q: How to install Honeyd in Ubuntu? I am using Ubuntu 12.04 in VMware.

I am planning to write some device drivers and I need to get the Linux kernel source. My Linux kernel version is 3.2.0-23-generic-pae and I downloaded the image from this. In many of the articles I have read, it tells me that I need to have the entire kernel tree to start inserting new modules. \nIs it enough if I download this image and paste it into the usr/src/ folder or do I have to do something else?\n\nA: Just pick one from:\nsudo apt install linux-source  # downloads into system directory\nsudo apt source linux-source  # downloads into working directory\n\nIf you're told to give some 'sources' URLs in your sources.list, go edit your /etc/apt/sources.list file and uncomment the desired deb-src line, for example (if you're running Xenial):\ndeb http://fr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ xenial main restricted\n# deb-src http://fr.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ xenial main restricted\n\nRemoving the # on this last line enables sources repositories for download, including kernel sources.\nRemarks:\n\n\n*\n\n*Use modern tools; avoid apt-get.\n\n*These commands download the source code for your current kernel (in my case 4.4.0-75-generic for example).\n\n*When downloaded into system directory, files are stored in /usr/src/linux-source-4.4.0/ (for example).\n\n\nA: Download source directly from Launchpad\nStrangely enough everyone recommends apt-get source  which doesn't work most of the time if you're looking for a specific kernel version:\nSay you need kernel source for 3.19.0-58 :\napt-get source linux-image-3.19.0-58-generic will get the source for the latest kernel in the series: 3.19.0-80 in this case, which is not what you asked for.\nSo you have two options: \n1) Give up, install kernel 3.19.0-80 and use apt-get source\n2) Get source directly from launchpad:\n\n\n*\n\n*Google site:launchpad.net \"linux-image-3.19.0-58-generic\"\n\n*That should give you the Launchpad Package Page for that version.\n\n*Scroll down, click the \"Source:\" link, you're on the Package Source Page now.\n\n*Scroll down and download .tar.gz, .diff.gz, .dsc files:\n\n\n\n*\n\n*Put them in a new directory, unpack with dpkg-source -x *.dsc\nNotes:\n\n\n*\n\n*There must be a better way.\n\n*You can get the version you want from git, but you're in for a big download. See \"Obtaining the kernel sources for an Ubuntu release using git\" in Ubuntu Wiki Kernel Source Code.\n\n\nA: This will get the source of the stock kernel:\napt-get source linux-source\n\n\n\n*\n\n*https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile/\nYou can check what version of the kernel is running like this:\nuname -r\n\nWhich will print something like:\n3.13.0-46-generic\n\nYou can find a list of current source package versions available on your system via:\napt-cache search linux-source\n\nTo get the upstream version of the kernel:\ngit clone git://kernel.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-trusty.git\n\n\n\n*\n\n*https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam/GitKernelBuild\nIn the above link, 'trusty' is the codename for the version of Ubuntu.  You can find out the codename for the version of Ubuntu you have installed via:\ncat /etc/lsb-release\n\n\nA: apt-get source linux\n\nis the easiest way. It will download the source from your repository - and it'll be the same as the version you're running (assuming you haven't already customised it).\nBut if you want to find where the source is maintained you can run:\napt-cache showsrc linux\n\nLook for the 'Vcs-' attribute (Version control system). It'll usually be a git (Vcs-Git) or mercurial repository.\nNote - these commands work with any package. Just substitute 'linux' with the package you're interested in. And also note that 'apt-get source' doesn't need sudo access and will dump the source in your current directory.\n\nA: There are cases where it is simply more practical to download the linux kernel source and headers for the version you're interested in directly from http://kernel.org (a pretty reliable URL/site that isn't going away [e.g. standard stackoverflow concern about stale links isn't not an issue])\nReason? For example, you might be interested in debugging an older/defunct no-longer-supported version of linux where package repository points to dead areas, where in some cases there are either no viable current alternatives, or the repos has are expired keys that won't let you get the stuff, requiring unmemorable difficult to search out arcane techniques to get those repositories to work anyway.\nOr maybe Internet networking might be broken on Linux machine (or VM) you're using, but file sharing or NFS works, where the source can be downloaded onto another machine and accessed via the filesystem.\nIf you're working with a relatively obsolete version of Linux, chances are you'll have to build a number of things from source and get them the hard way.\n", "Q: Unable to start Ubuntu 12.04.

If you don't have a desktop installed, install lynx which is a command line web browser. lynx http://localhost will show you if the web server is working.\nThe reason for doing this from the server is that you haven't got to worry about any other networking issues.\nWhat the Apache is telling you is that it cannot work out what the default server domain should be. This is fine on a development machine.\nIf you want to get access to this server from outside the local machine, you need to add appropriate ServerName directives in an appropriate Apache configuration file. Update your question if this is what you need and I will update the answer with more detail. You will need to say what kind of networking you are using though.\n", "Q: When will packages uploaded to PPA by dput available? dput completed successfully, but refreshing the corresponding launchpad page doesn't render a change, it still says \"no updates\" for this PPA, am I doing something wrong ?\n\nA: *\n\n*dput ppa:warlock/spell (or whatever)\n\n*Wait for email from Launchpad, whose subject should say (hopefully):\n[PPA warlock-spell] [ubuntu/precise] oohitsmagic 1.2.3-4~ppa1precise1 (Accepted)\nor if you messed something up:\n[PPA warlock-spell] oohitsmagic_1.2.3-4~ppa1precise1_source.changes rejected\n\n*If the upload is successful, then you can check the status on the PPA page, where it should say 2 packages waiting to build (or similar), and you can click on them to see what the approximate wait-time is before the builds for the different architectures begin.\n\n*Unless you want to keep pressing F5 (hey, I did that for my first PPA upload :), go get a coffee, take a nap, etc., but keep your eye out for the Launchpad email sent if your build fails, with a subject like:\n[Build #1234567] i386 build of oohitsmagic 1.2.4-4~ppa1precise1 in ubuntu precise RELEASE (warlock-spell PPA)\n\n*If the build succeeds, that will be show in the status bar for your PPA on the right; note that even after this, you must wait for the binaries to be published in the PPA before you can go around apt-getting them (a green gear means wait, a check mark means published).\n\nA: Wait 1 hour and 30 minutes, then reffresh the PPA page.\n", "Q: Tried to boot Ubuntu, but the GRUB rescue prompt shows up instead Tried to boot Ubuntu, but this shows up instead:\ngrub rescue>\n\n\nA: If you were able to boot Ubuntu in the past, but not now, follow these steps to solve the problem.\n\n*\n\n*First type ls command and Press Enter to see all the available partitions.\nThe entries will be shown as (hd0,msdos1) (hd0,msdos2) (hd0,msdos5) etc.\n\n\n*Then type ls (hd0,msdos1)/ to see the content of the drive. if you see entries like  vmliuz or initrd, it is your Linux partition.

It's not intended to spread Ubuntu by installing it everywhere, but rather for running my configured system on any computer I come across. So far, I went with installing Ubuntu with unetbootin, however, I have some issues with this. When installed with netbootin, the original disk image is kept intact on the flash drive, forever. Also, a file is created for persistent storage and during boot it is accessed together with the image by overlayfs. This, in my opinion, has the following problems:\n\n\n*\n\n*If system is updated regularly, then files from the image are overwritten in persistent storage, doubling their size and wasting precious space.\n\n*Persistent storage has a fixed size that you have to define from the start, again, wasting precious space.\n\n*I'm not 100% sure, but maybe using overlayfs makes disk access slower, and more so on the relatively slow devices.\n\n\nSo I'd like to find another solution: either to get rid of the original image or to install Ubuntu \"normally\" on the separate ext2 partition, or maybe even install it in the main vfat partition on the USB stick.

You need to purge this installation and reinstall the coorect graphics driver (ensuring you all meet all the correct dependencies).  This may also be the cause of Cinnamon not working (but if it il doesnt work you can ask a new question here).\nHopefully some else has knowledge about the Android Emulator (not a strong subject with me) but lets get you system stable first\nInstructions on how to install your graphics driver can be found here\n\nA: I have had the exact same problem.\nI have:\n  -Followed all the links.\n  -Installed all the libraries.\n  -Uninstalled/reinstalled, sudo aticonfig --initial=dual-head, ... nothing helpful.\nMy advice, although not very helpful, is to make a new installation on a computer that already has drivers available.  Build a computer with known working components that have the software to support it.  Otherwise I will keep my eye on this link for something USEFUL.\n\nA: Sometimes I have to bother on certain systems when installing ATI graphics using Additional Drivers. To fix this, I open a terminal and type:\nsudo apt-get install fglrx\n\n\nA: I am also using HP pavillion g6-1302tx, i have followed the following link to install the graphic drivers on my laptop.\nhttp://www.upubuntu.com/2012/03/how-to-install-ati-amd-catalyst-122.html\nBlank screen at the booting time is still an issue. Well setting nomodeset option abruptly increased the brightness of the screen and the brightness adjustment keys stopped responding; so it's better not to use nomodeset option.\nHope this is helpful.\n\nA: I just dealt with the the same issue on my system (Though mine is a desktop) Go to the ATI website and grab the driver for \"Linux\" operating systems. It should come in a .run format once you have it on a thumb drive or wherever you need to do some very basic things (Which aren't so basic to find on the Internet). First Place the .run file on your desktop (For simplicity) then rename it something short, sweet, and to the point (EX. GD.run) which stands for (Graphics Driver). Then once you get to that point you need to shutdown \"X\" server before attempting to install. I assume you already know how to do this but in the case that you don't I will clarify because this is also not so straight forward on the Internet. So to shutdown \"X\" server you need to open terminal and run this command \nsudo /etc/init.d/lightdm stop\n\nsometimes that one fails to stop the \"X\" server so try this one. To check if it fails simply do the remainder of the steps and it will tell you whether the \"X\" server is still running. \nsudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop\n\nThen you need to press CTRL+ALT+F1 and then enter the following. (Here comes the part why I told you to put it onto the desktop and name it something simple and easy to remember.)\nEnter Login Credentials\ncd ~/Desktop \nchmod +x GD.run\nsudo ./gd.run\n\nThen simply follow the steps given by the driver. Then to leave the black screen CTRL+ALT+F7 After that point it is a matter of going to the Catalyst Manager and setting it up. \n\nA: You seems to have 2 problem at the same time:\n\n\n*\n\n*a problem with the drivers of your graphic card, in this case i suggest to take a look at http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Main_Page which is a good place to start and remember to uninstall everything that is old before installing something new\n\n*a problem with your android environment, and in this case you probably are messing up with the Mesa library that is the OpenGL implementation used by the Android emulator, just take a look at how to setup your OS for Android development http://source.android.com/source/initializing.html\n", "Q: Open source or free antivirus software Can you kindly tell me regarding antivirus software, open source or free codes are safe or not?

Seems something has gone wrong with the user creation? How can I correct this?\n\nA: If you created the user account with useradd, you have to set up everything for it manually. This is why, when creating user accounts from the command-line, it is recommended to use adduser in Ubuntu (and Debian, and other Debian-based systems) instead. You might just want to remove the user with userdel or deluser and recreate it with adduser. Otherwise...\nFixing the Home Directory Location\nIf you want to keep the user account and fix the problem, then you need to look at:\n\n\n*\n\n*the name of the home directory the user account is actually configured for\n\n*the name of the directory you actually created\n\n\nThese must be exactly the same. The error message you get with su -l penner is telling you that they are not the same.\nTo check the home directory the user account is actually configured for, run this command (see man 5 passwd and man grep for more information):\ngrep penner /etc/passwd\n\nYou should see a line like this:\npenner:x:1000:1000:Eliah Kagan,,,:/home/penner:/bin/bash\n\nThat is, the sixth :-separated field (after the fifth :) contains the home directory. If it's not /home/penner, it should be. If the directory you created for the user is not /home/penner, it should be, too. If the two directories are the same but neither one is /home/penner, then that might theoretically work, but you should make them both /home/penner, because lots of software assumes that all non-root users' home directories are /home/username.\nYou can change penner's home directory to /home/penner by running this command:\nsudo usermod -d /home/penner penner\n\n\n\n*\n\n*See man usermod for more information.\n\n\nEnsuring it is a Directory, and that the User Has Access\nIf (or once) the names are both /home/penner, you should also make sure that the user has access to their own home directory. Run:\nls -ld /home/penner\n\nYou should see something that looks like this (though the date and time will be different):\ndrwxr-xr-x 43 penner penner 4096 2012-07-03 06:41 /home/penner\n\nIf instead of drwxr-xr-x, you have something that starts with - rather than d, then you created a file rather than a directory. Delete the file and make a directory there instead.\nIf instead of the first penner you have something else, then the user doesn't own their home directory, so make them own it:\nsudo chown penner /home/penner\n\n\n\n*\n\n*See man chown for more information.\n\n\nIf instead of drwxr-xr-x there are dashes in the next three characters after the d, then the user doesn't have full access there. Fix that as follows:\nsudo chmod u+rwx /home/penner\n\n\n\n*\n\n*See man chmod for more information.\n\n\n(penner is capable of running this command if they own their home directory, so if you prefer, you can run this as: sudo -u penner u+rwx /home/penner)\nEnsuring Other Users Don't Have Blanket Write Access\nIf instead of drwxr-xr-x, there are ws instead of -s in the last six letters, then users besides penner may have write access to penner's home directory. This is dangerous (unless you really know what you're doing and want it this way and have set things up so it won't be a problem). To fix it:\nsudo chmod -R go-w /home/penner\n\nOther Defaults\nThere are some other changes you may want to make. By default in Ubuntu (that is, if you create a user account with adduser or with a graphical tool, which you did not):\n\n\n*\n\n*Home directories have read and write permissions for everyone, not just the user who owns them. Users can change this, either for the whole home directory or any files and subdirectories inside it. But if you do want this default, and you don't have the second and third r and x in drwxr-xr-x, run:\nsudo chmod 755 /home/penner\n\n(penner is capable of running this command if they own their home directory, so if you prefer, you can run this as: sudo -u penner chmod 755 /home/penner)\n\n*Each user has his/her own group, with the same name as the user, and this is the user's primary group. Their home directory is owned by this group. That's the meaning of the second penner in drwxr-xr-x 43 penner penner 4096 2012-07-03 06:41 /home/penner. It's OK to break with this default, if you know what you are doing. But if it's not your intention to do things differently, you should make sure penner is set up this way, since some possible primary group identities for a user, or group owners on the user's home directory, could lead to security problems.\nRun groups penner. (See man groups for more information.) You should see something like this:\npenner : penner adm dialout cdrom plugdev lpadmin sambashare\n\nDon't worry if it's not quite like that. I'll get to that soon. Instead, look at the first word after the :. That's the name of the user's primary group. Assuming you want it to be penner, make sure it is. If it isn't, change it:\nsudo usermod -g penner penner\n\nIf you get an error saying that the group penner doesn't exist, then you'll have to create it with this command (and then run the above command again):\nsudo addgroup penner\n\n\n\n*\n\n*See man addgroup for more information. (If you prefer, you can alternatively use the groupadd command to create groups.)\n\n\n*When you ran groups penner, you may have gotten a list of groups considerably shorter than my penner : penner adm dialout cdrom plugdev lpadmin sambashare. For desktop users, the adm, dialout, cdrom, plugdev, lpadmin, and sambashare provide abilities that desktop users should generally have. Therefore, unless you have a reason to do otherwise, penner should be in these groups. These are not primary groups, however, so they're set differently. Supposing penner is not in any of these groups and you want penner to be in all of them, run this command:\nsudo usermod -a -G adm,dialout,plugdev,lpadmin,sambashare penner\n\nIn case you're interested, here's what all those groups mean:\n\n\n*\n\n*adm users can view most system log files in /var/log.\n\n*dialout users can use dial-up modems.\n\n*plugdev users can mount and use external storage devices.\n\n*lpadmin users can set up and manage printers.\n\n*sambashare users can share files (via Samba) with other computers over a network.\n\n\n(Source: Privileges, in the Ubuntu documentation wiki.)\nMaking the User an Administrator\nIf you don't want penner to be an administrator, you probably don't need to do anything else. You can check if penner is an administrator with groups penner. If neither admin nor sudo is listed, then penner is not an administrator.\nIf you want penner to be an administrator, add penner to whichever of these groups exists. (You may as well add penner to both, if they both exist.) You can accomplish that by running these two commands separately--if either one succeeds, you've made penner an administrator:\nsudo usermod -a -G admin penner\nsudo usermod -a -G sudo penner\n\n\n\n*\n\n*The reason there are two groups is that, before Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, administrators were in the admin group. Starting with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, administrators are in the sudo group. But if your 12.04 LTS system is upgraded from a previous release (and this should apply to later Ubuntu releases, such as 12.10 when it comes out, that are upgraded from Ubuntu 11.10 or earlier), then for backward compatibility, administrators are members of both sudo and admin. Generally, if one of these groups doesn't confer administrative abilities, it simply doesn't exist, so running both the above two commands (separately, not as sudo usermod -a -G admin,sudo penner) is generally a safe and effective way to make penner an administrator.\n\n\nA: This mostly happens when you create the user without creating a home directory for the user. This can be solved by using this command when creating user\nuseradd -m the_username\n\nThe -m flag is what creates the home directory for the user. After creating the user check if the home directory exists for that user by doing \nls /home\n\nIf you can see that username listed there then the last thing to do is assign a password to that user\npasswd the_username\n\nYou can now login with that username and password\n\nA: ctrl+alt+f1 and login there and run\nsudo chown -R $USER:$USER $HOME\nthen press ctrl+alt+f7 and try to login \nIt will work\n", "Q: Where did the startup-applications-preferences program go?

Since Ubuntu 11.10, I have experienced no end of trouble with my NVidia Quadro NVS 290 in TwinView dual-monitor output.  Others have similar desktop TwinView woes. I want a new graphics card. \nPreviously I asked for a graphics card recommendation and response was Nvidia Geforce GTS 450... but really I'm looking for someone who has actually got a working dual-monitor desktop to tell me what card they use so I can get something that is known to work.\nSo please, people who have no-issues with their 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04 Unity 3D desktop spread across two HD-resolution external monitors (either DVI or HDMI connector), and who also run Google Chrome (which throws a spanner due to its own GPU compositing)... please let me know what graphics card you have so I can buy one.\nGathering Options\nThese seem to be the Nvidia cards featuring dual DVI.  But they all seem to be gaming cards - what has dual-DVI, good support, but is not a massive gaming card?\n\n\n*\n\n*Nvidia GTS 450 (previously recommended) - 2x DVI\n\n*Nvidia GTX 550 Ti (used by System76)  - 2x DVI\n\n*Nvidia GT 430 (used by System76) - 1xDVI, 1xHDMI\n\n*Nvidia GT 640 (found on NVidia site) - 1xDVI, 1xHDMI  (also GT 620, GT 630)\n\n\nHas anyone had a good desktop dual-monitor Unity 3D experience with ATI cards?\nDecision\nI've decided to go with the Geforce GT 620, which is the successor to the GT 430 and GT 530 in the performance ranking.  I don't want gaming power, and the 4xx and 5xx chips seem to be out of stock, so I'll just hold thumbs that the binary blob will handle it correctly because it's a GeForce chip instead of a Quadro chip.\n\nA: I've bought the Nvidia Geforce GT 620.   \nThe GT 620 is a 2012 card, and at the lower-end card so it's affordable, but still performant at 11.2 gigatexel/second fill rate - and it supports multiple monitors on the different outputs (HDMI, DVI, VGA).\nSo far it works fine.  I've got two identical monitors one on the HDMI and other on DVI, and and the colors seem slightly different at factory default settings.\nIt seems the main thing is to avoid Quadro cards on linux - GeForce cards work fine.\n\nA: What you are requiring is not impossible to achieve for any modern GPU, even some low end APUs like the AMD C50 can support up to 3 monitors in HD resolution, but i think that you are better choosing ATI for its eyefinity technology or buying a Matrox videocard; buying a Quadro or a FireGL doesn't make much sense in todays world.\nMatrox is the first company to offer a seriously good support for more than 1 display, they are just the only one company in the world specialized in that field and they are good at since their foundation, ATI is offering that kind of support since 2009 with Eyefinity, Nvidia was the last on the field with its Nvidia surround technologies.\nYour choice is simple, if you have to work with your PC buy a Matrox, with work i mean basically CAD and some special appliance in the multi-monitor industry; if you have to play some games go for an ATI, they are cheap and powerfull.\n", "Q: What are some alternatives to jDownloader for 12.04? \nPossible Duplicate:\nIs there some application to download files from popular file hosting websites? \n\nI just added the JDownloader PPA and installed the app but when I launch the app I get a JUpdate box telling me to download which it never does so I'm looking for a  good lightweight alternative to JDownloader. Any help \n\nA: *\n\n*For an alternative available in the repositories, try Tucan Manager tucan, although I haven't had a very good experience with it.\n\n*For a lightweight GUI alternative, I highly recommend FreeRapid (it still uses Java)\n\n*For a non-Java GUI, try Pyload (deb files available)\n\n*If you are comfortable with the command-line, try plowshare, also available from the ppa:plowsharepackagers/ppa PPA.\n\n\nA: What java are you using? I think only oracle java works with jdownloader.\nJust in case if you want to try again with jdownloader.\n\nA: Free Rapid Downloader (FRD) although still Java-based is a lot lighter than JD and can be used in Ubuntu. \nIt does not need installation, just execute the frd.sh file.\nMake it executable first - changing permissions in properties or fire in terminal sudo chmod a+x path-of-frd.sh. (copy frd.sh file and paste in place of path-of-frd.sh in this line)\nIf there's an error message that keeps popping-up, ignore it's of no consequence. \n\nFrom my experience Tucan it's by no means a good alternative (it never worked for me). \nThere is also ochDownloader (non-java, therefore very light) that I used in Windows and has a Linux version (but it needs compiling I guess, above my capacities).\n", "Q: Is VMware 8 compatible with Ubuntu 12.04? I am using VMware 8.0.4 and want to install Ubuntu 12.04, but I have not been able to do so successfully. Can you suggest compatible versions of VMware and Ubuntu? In particular, will Ubuntu 12.04 work with VMware 8?\n\nA: VMware 8.0.4 is compatible with Ubuntu 12.04, you just need to apply a simple patch to allow the modules to build on the 3.2 kernel used by Ubuntu.\nThe patch is described and available on this page, but the version in there needs to be changed to 8.0.4 to apply successfully.\nHere's how:\nTo download and apply the patch,\n\n\n*\n\n*Open a terminal and type:\n\nmkdir vmw_patch && cd vmw_patch\nwget -O- http://weltall.heliohost.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/vmware802fixlinux320.tar.gz | tar -xz\nsed -i -e 's/8.0.2/8.0.4/g' patch-modules_3.2.0.sh \n./patch-modules_3.2.0.sh\n\n\n*That should compile the modules without any errors.\n\nExplanation: wget downloads the patch, and tar extracts it without actually saving the downloaded file. sed updates 8.0.2 to 8.0.4 in the patching script so that it will run.\n\n", "Q: caps lock control At our site we generally prefer the key to the left of the \"A\" to be Control, and we don't need a Caps Lock key.\nOn existing x.org configurations we use 'Option \"XkbOptions\" \"ctrl:nocaps\"' to get this behaviour in X, which is usually good enough for us.\nOn Ubuntu 12.04 we have found this not to work.  In addition to this, we have tried editing /etc/default/keyboard to contain 'XKBOPTIONS=\"ctrl:nocaps\"'.  This didn't appear to have an effect.\nWe have observed that when an individual user configures this behaviour through \nSystem Settings, ~/.gconf/desktop/gnome/peripherals/keyboard/kbd/%gconf.xml appears to record the configuration.  However, even for admin users, we haven't located the \"Apply For All Users\" (or similar) option in the config application.\nWe would like to make Caps Lock act as a Control key by default for our users.\nThe most important requirements are that it works in X sessions started by GDM, and that individual users still have a way to override the setting for their own account.\nIdeally, but less importantly, we would also favour solutions that work in all X sessions (not just those started by GDM), and also on the console.\n\nA: Try setting the gconf value under /etc/gconf/gconf.xml.defaults/.  If you drop packages to manage settings, you can alternatively put a file under /var/lib/gconf/defaults/.\n", "Q: How to read the password from variable? I am trying to move my file to another system which is located in some other place, with this command:\nrsync -avrz  src destination\n\nIt works fine. But what I need is to put this command in shell script and run it like:\n#! /bin/sh\nrsync -avrz  srcfilelocation destination\n\nWhen it runs, it asks for the destination system password. I know that password and give it manually.\nNow I have decided to assign the password to an environment variable, like pswd=\"destination system password\". I need my shell script to read the password from this variable. How can I write a script to do this?\n\nA: You don't need to worry about passwords when you can use something called Public Key Infrastructure.\nThis is a method of using public and private keys to authenticate a user. You store a copy of your private key, and the other server has a copy of your public key. When you log in, they have a little conversation with each other which confirms the public and private keys match so you can log in without entering a password.\nThis is as secure as anything as long as you don't share your private key with anyone!\nTo set this up is really simple.\nOn source machine, run ssh-keygen. You can accept all the defaults, that'll be enough for this purpose. It'll generate your private (id_rsa) and public(id_rsa.pub) keys in your ~/.ssh folder.\nNow you want to get the public key on the server, which is easy too.\nFrom the source pc, run ssh-copy-id username@servername.\nThis will place a copy of id_rsa.pub's content in the server's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.\nNow if you ssh from the source to the destination you will get in without requiring a password.\nHow does this affect rsync I hear you ask? Rsync uses ssh!\nPlease remember: NEVER GIVE OUT YOUR PRIVATE KEY (id_rsa) or someone can pretend to be you.\n\nA: I do recommend using PKI/SSH keys over doing this but if you need to you can set an environment variable like so:\nexport RSYNC_PASSWORD=\"yourPasswordHere\"\n\nPlease note that this does have some potential security implications and will only be available in the current session.\nTo add this to a user's session by default:\necho 'export RSYNC_PASSWORD=\"yourPasswordHere\"' >> ~/.bashrc\n\nAlternatively, you can use a password file to store your password. Please note that the password is in plain text, so you should take steps to protect it.\necho \"yourPasswordHere\" > yourPasswordFile.txt\nrsync -avrz --password-file yourPasswordFile.txt src dest\n\n", "Q: All partitions disappeared after a power outage After a power outage, my partitions won't appear anymore on my Ubuntu 12.04 but everything is fine on Windows.

Be sure to ensure your\n  program is marked executable, if it is a shell script ensure it starts\n  with an appropriate shebang (e.g. #!/bin/sh), and do not expect any\n  standard output to appear on your terminal.\n\nSo basically the problems could be:\na) You're not using a shebang for the usb_autorun.sh and you need to add #!/bin/bash to both autorun.sh and usb_autorun.sh\nb) try this line instead and use #!/bin/sh on both autorun.sh and usb_autorun.sh:\nDIR=$( readlink -f \"$( dirname \"$0\" )\")\n\nNote: This solution is a bit unsafe (Anyone can run anything in autorun.sh and get it executed), but on a local basis I believe it's harmless. Nevertheless, I would use some other name instead of \"autorun.sh\", such as \"install_deb.sh\" -- just to avoid any malware scripts.\n", "Q: How do I use a quickly community template (e.g. ubuntu-application-qt)? I would like to look at the Qt and QtQuick templates for quickly. The documentation for them seems to be non-existent. But I found a previously answered question (http://askubuntu.com/questions/25671/quickly-template-for-pyqt?lq=1) with an answer that links to the Launchpad project with community templates. After clicking around for a while, I stumbled on a PPA that I could follow directions to add in the development team on Launchpad. After I added the PPA, I could successfully install the package with sudo aptitude install quickly-community-templates-common. However, it seems that I still only have the three default templates available from quickly:\n$ quickly create ubuntu-application-qt myproject\nERROR: No template specified for command create.\nUsage: quickly create <template> <project-name>\nCandidate templates are: ubuntu-application, ubuntu-cli, ubuntu-flash-game\n\nI went to Launchpad and put this up as a bug. But they have a bug from 16/6 that still isn't answered, so it doesn't seem to be much activity there. And I'm not sure if this is a bug or if it's just a result of me not understanding anything about how to use this since there is no documentation. So I'm asking the question here instead: how do I use these templates for quickly?\n\nA: Got an answer through e-mail from David Planella on my bug submission;\nFor now, you will need to manually install the quickly-ubuntu-\napplication-qt-template package to be able to use the Qt templates.\n\nIn the near future, we'll look into having a metapackage that installs\nall templates at once.\n\nSo installing the metapackage like I did currently does nothing, apparently. Instead, one have to know to install the individual packages for each template. But I tried it and it does indeed work. \nHowever, these templates are not for PyQt4! They are for PySide. So I have to do some serious editing, but at least this links \"quickly design\" to Qt Designer. One step forward at least.\n\nA: Templates which are prepackaged with quickly  ubuntu-application, ubuntu-cli and ubuntu-flash-game only ,you can install quickly-unity-lens-template from software center ,other templates still under development , \nHow do I use a quickly template?\n      quickly create template_name name_of_the_app\n\nEg,quickly create ubuntu-application jotty\n", "Q: Can I extract a printer driver from a package?

I'm especially interested in the contents of my former home directory.\n\nA: Depends on how you partitioned your Ubuntu installation.

What's the equivalent for gettext.ngettext? __?\n\nA: I've seen P_ (I assume the letter P stands for plural) used sometimes, but it seems there is not a general agreement or a defined standard for a shortcut to plural strings for translations in gettext.\nGenerally these shortcuts or macros are used in C and come from GLib, so they are not standard shortcuts from Gettext, but they've become a de facto standard for programs that use GLib. They are generally defined in the /usr/include/glib-2.0/glib/gi18n.h file, and explained in detail on the Internationalization API docs for GLib.  \nThere are definitions for _ (gettext), Q_ (context), C_ (context), N_ (mark for translation only) and NC_ (mark for translation only, with context), but no P_\nIn any case, in Python you'll need to define the shortcuts yourself, but it'd be goot to stick to the same naming convention, for consistency's sake.\nHowever, I seem to remember intltool does not recognize the P_ shortcut by default, so since ngettext is not used as often as gettext, you might want to just use the actual name of the function and not a shortcut.\nIf you still want to use a shortcut, and it is not supported by intltool, you'll need to tell intltool to use it, IIRC through the XGETTEXT variable or through the use of a Makevars file.\n", "Q: How to make apport always open a bug report page? \nPossible Duplicate:\nHow can I track a bug that caused a crash and was reported via apport / whoopsie? \n\nSince I updated to 12.04 apport sends crash reports to the server silently without opening a bug report page on launchpad while I'd like to track this reports statuses.

Assuming it is something starting with wget, you could check using\nps aux|grep wget|grep -v grep\n\nThis utilises the ps tool to show the list of running processes for all users in long form (see man ps for details), pipes the output to grep which filters it and leaves only lines containing \"wget\", and finally pipes it to grep again to filter itself. Now you should see your download process -- or, otherwise, know you've got to start it again.\nOn the other hand you should see the running process in the terminal window where you executed it -- unless, of course, you \"backgrounded\" it using the ampersand at the end (e.g. \"wget [url] &\"). In this case, you can go to the exact terminal window where you started it, and type fg to bring it back to foreground.\nThird place to look for is where your downloaded files go to.

It works fine when I  call it like bash capsnotify.sh.\nThe problem now is when I bind my above script to capslock key using xbindkeys tool it doesn't work as required. It shows a notification caps ON when my caps is on but it doesn't show caps OFF notification when my caps is off instead it again shows the caps ON notification.\ncapsnotify.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\nvalue=$(xset -q | awk '/Caps/ {print $4}')\n\nif [ \"$value\" == \"on\" ]\n\nthen    \n    notify-send \"caps ON\"\n\nelif [ \"$value\" == \"off\" ]\n\nthen    \n    notify-send \"caps OFF\"    \nfi\n\n.xbindkeysrc\n\"bash /home/ranveer/capsnotify.sh\"\n  m:0x2 + c:66\n\nSo, the problem is after binding my caps lock key on both events(on/off) it shows caps ON notification.\n\nA: Probably the easiest thing to do would be to specify to xbindkeys that your script should be launched with gnome-terminal (or equivalent), for example, and minimise the size of the terminal. You could replace your entry in ~/.xbindkeysrc with:\n\"gnome-terminal --geometry=1x1+1141+27 --hide-menubar -e /home/ranveer/capsnotify.sh\"\n m:0x2 + c:66\n\nWe gained the geometry readout of the terminal by placing it at the top right hand corner of the screen and then running xwininfo and clicking on the window. By specifying such a small terminal (1x1) and its top right hand position (1141+27) and hiding the menubar, we can ensure that a thumbnail sized terminal actually opens momentarily underneath the caps lock notify messages at the top right of the screen. It should be possible to specify the geometry like this with other terminals such as well. \nAfter any changes to ~/.xbindkeysrc, you must enter\nkillall xbindkeys\n\nand then\nxbindkeys\n\nfor the new changes to be read.\nIn the screenshot below, I pressed caps-lock twice very quickly so that the first notify-send message had not yet disappeared:\n\nThere may be other ways of solving the problem, but this is a quick reliable one that does not entail any rewriting of your script or installing other programs.\n\nA: What worked for me is adding sleep before the call to my script in xbindkeys. So, now my .xbindkeysrc looks like \n\"sleep 0.1 && bash /home/ranveer/capsnotify.sh\"\n\nI believe it works by adding sleep because the call to xset to query the state of CapsLock happens before the Xserver has toggled the state which might be due to my window manager which grabs the key event and doesn't process it super-quickly and thus X toggles a bit later.\n", "Q: How to mount ext4 partition?

When it opens, run the command below.\ngksudo nautilus /etc/fstab\n\nTo mount the partition as \"data\" for example with read-write permissions add this entry in the /etc/fstab:\n/dev/sd8 /data ext4 defaults 1 2\n\nOnce the partition is mounted as \"data\", make yourself (my user account) the owner\nsudo chown flint:root /mnt/data\n\nand give yourself permission so you can access the partition \nsudo chmod 700 /mnt/data\n\n\nA: You don't.  The files in the fs are owned by whoever owns them, and you can not change that at mount time.  Instead you need to change the permissions to give yourself access with sudo chown yourname.yourname /path/to/mount.

Currently I don't have an Internet connection and I need to install MySQL server on Ubuntu 11.04 without any rpm packages. I have only the tar file with me. It has been extracted to the particular area. So what are the command to be used?\n\nA: First, Ubuntu is a dpkg-based Linux distribution, not rpm. So use apt-get or dpkg to install packages.\nSecond, MySQL 5.5 is much better than 5.1. And the latest Ubuntu release (precise) provides only 5.5 now.\nWell, since you have older releases, you can still use 5.1. The package mysql-server will always match the latest version of MySQL for your release.\nSince you do not have internet, you can run sudo apt-get install -sV mysql-server locally without connection. The option -s means \"dry run\" and the option -V means \"show version number\". This command does not require root permission and will not install anything really. It will just show list all the dependencies the package mysql-server needs and simulates installing them. Thus you can get both the dependencies, the architectures and the version numbers. You can use a redirection to save them to a text file and copy it to a computer with Internet connection. With this list of packages, you can download them on the computer with Internet and copy them back to the computer without Internet.\nOn the computer without Internet, you can use sudo dpkg -i *.deb to install all the .deb files you've downloaded from another computer.\n", "Q: windows system (bootloader) partition accidently deleted during multiple installs After experimenting with multiple variations of backtrack and xbmcbuntu variations of Ubuntu with dual boot successfully, my windows partition became unrecognizable to grub.\nI used my windows boot CD to try to correct the problem. However, I deleted all partitions except for the NFTS one that contains my old windows install. (And, merged all other ones into that in hopes of getting back to the windows boot loader and out of grub)\nNow, all I get is a grub command prompt when I try and boot the system (how??? - I thought I deleted grub) And, now the windows boot disc doesn't even recognize the install.\nI've tried TRK to try and resolve the problem. Though I must admit ignorance in correctly using this utility.\nI've searched for other answers to this problem. Any help would be much appreciated.\n\nA: There are two paths to take:\nGetting into Windows\n\n*\n\n*Boot a Ubuntu Live CD, and open Gparted.

Once you execute the command, Grub will be installed, hopefully recognizing the Windows partition. If you need to remove Grub and use the Windows loader, you will lose access to Ubuntu.(unless you chainload, which is outside the scope of this answer)\nConsider having Grub on an external drive and booting to it to load Ubuntu, if nothing else works.\nEdit: On SGD, I believe I may not have given perfect instructions.

I use WinXP on VMware inside Ubuntu 12.04.\nNeed connect VMware XP box to internet with some reliable algorithm through Host-only, NAT, or with Bridged connection. \nPlease suggest me any right way strategy for 1 network card (Atheros).\n\nA: The most common solution is to use two network interfaces on your guest OS.  One bridged and the other host only.  This way you get bi-directional host-guest connections whether or not you have an external network connection.  \nIt's detailed on the VMWare help page here.\nIf VMWare doesn't support bridged to Atheros wireless, I know that Virtualbox does.\n\nSolution from link above (\"Removing a Host Virtual Adapter on a Linux Host\") and common wizard to configure VMware virtual network:  \n1\nBecome root and run the VMware Workstation configuration script.\nsu\nvmware-config.pl\n\n2\nWatch for the following question\nDo you want networking for your Virtual Machines? (yes/no/help) [yes]\n\nAnswer Yes if you still want to use any networking in your virtual machines, then continue to the next question.\nOtherwise, answer No to remove all networking.\n3\nIf you answer Yes, the script prompts you to select the wizard or editor to edit your network configuration. Select editor. This is the only way to delete virtual network adapters without removing all of them.\nWould you prefer to modify your existing networking configuration using the wizard  \nor the editor? (wizard/editor/help) [wizard] editor\n\n4\nYou see a list of virtual networks that have been configured. Select the network corresponding to the adapter you wish to disable.\nThe following virtual networks have been defined:\n\n. vmnet0 is bridged to eth0\n. vmnet1 is a host-only network on subnet 172.16.155.0.\n. vmnet8 is NAT network on a private subnet 172.16.107.0.\n\nWhich virtual network do you wish to configure? (0-99) 1\n\n5\nYou may be prompted to keep this virtual network. If you are sure you want to remove it, answer Yes to the question.\nThe network vmnet1 has been reserved for a host-only network. You may change it,\nbut it is highly recommended that you use it as a host-only network.\nAre you sure you want to modify it? (yes/no) [no] yes\n\n6\nWhen prompted about the type of virtual network, select None and the virtual network will be removed.\nWhat type of virtual network do you wish\nto set vmnet1? (bridged,hostonly,nat,none) [hostonly] none \n\n\nA: Try Virtualbox instead its free and the internet is connected through your Ubuntu host so no messing I found this by far the best VM you even get 3D acceleration for graphics.\nAlternatively you could look in to a dual boot then you can have windows and Ubuntu on the same machine and both run at full speed\nDual boot is the best way to go tho in my opinion if you need any advice on that post back here and let me know.\n\nA: If you want to create a bridged network device and use that to connect your VM to the outside network, you can do it with /etc/network/interfaces.  I'm going to assume that your main network device (on the host) is eth0 below.  Note that few (if any) wireless drivers support bridging, so you'll probably need to have a wired connection for this to work.  (See this question on Server Fault.)  Once you've done this, you should have a 'bridged' network device available.\n\nIf you already use /etc/network/interfaces to define your networks, you should have a section in it that looks something like this:\nauto eth0\niface eth0 inet dhcp\n\nThere might also be some following lines (e.g. address X.X.X.X) if you're using static rather than dhcp in there.\n\nTo define a new bridged network device, first ensure that you have the bridge-utils package installed.\nThen copy all of those eth0 lines (the auto and iface sections, along with any options) within /etc/network/interfaces and change the device name to br0 in the new copy.  Also add an extra option line somewhere in the iface br0 ... section that reads:\nbridge_ports eth0\n\nThen remove all of the old eth0 definition that you took the copy of and replace it with just this single line:\niface eth0 inet manual\n\nSo, if your eth0 section initially looked like the example above, you should now have this:\niface eth0 inet manual\n\nauto br0\niface br0 inet dhcp\n  bridge_ports eth0\n\nThe br0 bridge device has now taken on the role that eth0 had, and the bridge_ports and manual lines means that it will attach the physical eth0 hardware to itself in order to reach your network.  Any other devices (such as the VM's virtual network card) that subsequently attach to the bridge will share this attachment to eth0, letting them access your network directly, like a real machine, rather than by proxying through your host.\nSee man 5 bridge-utils-interfaces for more details.\n\nIf you manage your networks through Network Manager, you might not have an existing eth0 entry in /etc/network/interfaces, in which case you'll need to add one.  If you just use plain DHCP, then the example above should be sufficient.  If you have defined a static IP address, then you'll need to replicate your settings in the file.  See 'The static Method' under 'INET ADDRESS FAMILY' in man 5 interfaces for details of the available options.  Normally you'll just need to set the address, netmask, and gateway options.\nBy default, Network Manager will stay away from any devices that are defined in /etc/network/interfaces; however, if you set managed=true in section [ifupdown] of /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf then it will let you start and stop (though still not edit) those interfaces through the GUI applet as normal.  See man 5 NetworkManager.conf for details.\n\nNote that you will need to manually bring these devices down before making changes, and then back up again afterwards, for example with\nsudo ifdown eth0\n\nand\nsudo ifup br0\n\nIf all else fails, rebooting once the new configuration is in place should work.\n", "Q: Video/Graphic render issue with high quality (HD) I have Dell N5010 with 512 MB Graphics (ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5470), 4GB RAM, i3 2.53GHz, 15'4'' LED Display, Ubuntu 11.10.\nWhen I open a HD video/movie with VLC, Rhytmbox, or Media Player (default) it hangs.

When installing Ubuntu does it erase the other O.S.?\n\nA: Not if you don't want it to. Boot in to live CD when ask click \"Install Ubuntu\" then \"install side by side with Windows.\" Set HDD sizes for both OSes, and install.\nWhen you boot you will see a boot loader called grub with about 5 options. One is Ubuntu; one is Windows; the rest are verious safe modes for Ubuntu. Choose your os and off you go.\nOr mount a live CD in Windows and click Wubi to create Ubuntu as a windows program if you just want to try it out.\n\nA: it depends on how you install Ubuntu. You can install it side by side (which is a dual setup) or overwrite the other OS or if you are using Windows even install through Windows with WUBI without nearly changing anything to the OS at all. If you use a live CD to install Ubuntu, it lists you the available options on how to install Ubuntu (including not erasing the preinstalled OS).\nIf you are just curious and want to test Ubuntu safely, I'd advise you using WUBI to install it as a Windows application or to run the live CD without installing Ubuntu.\n\nA: When installing Ubuntu from a Live CD, or USB, you have the option of partitioning the operating system, you also have the option of wiping the operating system and replacing it if preferred.\n\nA: It depends on the option, you selected during installation. There are (most of the time) three options in the installation phase. \"Install Ubuntu side by side\", \"Erase previous OS and install Ubuntu\", and \"Manual Partitioning\". If you select \"Install Ubuntu side by side\" option, it will not erase the old OS.\nIf you select, \"Install Ubuntu side by side\" option, Don't confuse with the slider. The Ubuntu partition is the right one. So, make size accordingly. You might see this answer to see the partitioning side.\n", "Q: How to force Ubuntu to access the Internet ONLY through a VPN and disable it when disconnected? Due to privacy issues I'd like Ubuntu to allow applications to send traffic to the Internet only when the VPN connection is established.\nThe thing is that there are some applications like Skype or Dropbox that will reconnect after the VPN connection is dropped for some reason. And I don't want that, I want them not to be able to.\nAny way to do this?\n\nA: Try this:\nTo get your default gateway IP, show your routes with the ip route list command.\nEdit your main internet connection to remove the default route: in nm-connection-editor, edit your connection > IPv4 tab > Routes > check Use this connection only for resources on its network.\nThen add a specific route to reach your VPN server via your gateway. This will allow your computer to reach only one IP on the internet: your VPN server, so that your VPN connection will still work. (in the Routes window, add a route like: Adress: VPN_SERVER_IP Netmask: 255.255.255.255 Gateway:GATEWAY_IP). \nTo allow internet access through your VPN, you may also need to edit the Routes of your VPN connection to uncheck \"Use this connection only for resources on its network\", or add a specific route for a custom gateway of your VPN.\n\n", "Q: Apt Dependency Problem: Packages in a PPA do not correctly depend on each other I'm trying to install Wireshark 1.6 on Ubuntu Lucid Lynx from PPA (n-muench/programs-ppa2).\nThe libwsutil1 version is named 1.6.0-1~ppa1 so it should satisfy libwiretap1 dependency that needs version 1.6.0-1 ;\nBut it doesn't !!\nI tried this:  \nsudo apt-get install libwiretap1\n\nAnd this:\nsudo apt-get -fm install libwiretap1\n\nBoth responded this:  \nThe following packages have unmet dependencies:\n  libwiretap1: Depends: libwsutil1 (>= 1.6.0-1) but 1.6.0-1~ppa1 is to be installed\nE: Broken packages\n\n(Notice that the ~ppa1 postfix seems to be the problem!)\nWhat can I do?  \n\nA: The -1~ppa1 tells the system that this isnt -1, but rather a version that will be overridden by -1.  This therefore is not an issue with \"version check\", nor is it a mistake, it's by design.  The special ~ symbol in the version means \"This version does not supercede version -1 of the same package, and may be superceded by version -1 of the package, or by a later upstream version release that gets packaged.\"\nTo do this, with the PPA, the version you see in that number would need to be 1.6.0-1 (within the PPA) in order for the system to recognize it as 1.6.0-1.\nThis is why packages such as PHP 5 release candidates get overridden when a stable release comes out (php 5.4.0-1~rc3 vs. php 5.4.0-1, where the rc3 is a release candidate and the non-rc3 is the stable)\n", "Q: Can I patch the PPC 12.04 kernel to allow older ATI drivers to install? Right now, with a PowerMac G5, the only way to install the graphics driver from the ATI binaries would be to patch the kernel, for my Radeon 9600 is only supported with the 9.3 installer, while the 12.6 has no effect. My current issue is that the new kernel with an old driver is preventing the install. Is there a way to correctly patch this without issues?\n\nA: My gut feeling is no, because the current (3.2) kernel ABI may not be fully backward-compatible with the binary blobs in the old 9.3 installer. Sorry :(\n", "Q: How can I add a progress bar to md5deep? I would like to implement a command line progress bar using pipe viewer or dialog GUI tool for the md5deep command. \nI tried the following :\npv file.md5 | md5deep -X - -r Destination\nI was not able to get the progress bar working. There is an option in md5deep where you can get the ETA by doing the following:\nmd5deep -eX file.md5 -r Destination\n\nThis option determines the ETA for each file and it is not possible to determine how long it might take for the entire directory. Any suggestions to implement a progress would be appreciated\n\nA: This is not particularly elegant, but it might do the trick (not using md5deep, but rather md5sum: however, every file is recursively listed and passed to md5sum,anyway):\n$ tar cf - .   | pv -s $(du -scb . | tail -1 | cut -f1) | tar tf - | xargs  md5sum  > /tmp/md5.txt 2> /tmp/md5.err.txt\n\n...note that this is not technically tracking progress of the md5sum, but rather tracking progress of tar/untar, then passing the file to md5sum after the fact.  The progress is only approximated by taking the size (du) of the directory to be processed; if the last file to process takes an hour, it'll report 100% for the duration of the processing of last file.  (I imagine something similar could be done by using something other than tar.)  And it is subject to all the limitations of tar/xargs in terms of filenames (spaces, etc). (As I said, not elegant.)\n", "Q: How can I install Opendtect? The Opendtect project is open source and still I have problems with the installation. When I run the installer, it does open a terminal for a second and then disappears.

The P8H61-M LX2 motherboard probably does not have a chipset capable of routing audio to the graphics controller.\nEDIT: Years later after upgrading to 14.04.3 I discovered that the HDMI audio devices had magically appeared, so it was an OS issue after all.\n", "Q: How to add Ubuntu App Showdown participation file to a submitted app?

And if you are doing this remotely, you need to use ssh -X in your remote connection command (do NOT automatically assume that will work)\nDoing sudo apt-get install firefox will install ffox and its dependencies, as well as a runtime environment (I believe).  Note that when you say 'how can i run ffox under command prompt', you need to be more specific, i.e. are you trying to run it from a terminal so it opens on the system its installed in, or are you trying to run it in the terminal itself, such that you have a terminal web browser.  Ffox does not work in the command line as a web browser if you are not using a GUI envirionment.  (take a look at w3m if you need a terminal text-like browser)\n\nA: Do you actually NEED firefox or do you just need a web browser that works in the terminal? I would try sudo apt-get install links or lynx both of those are terminal based web browsers.\nIf you plan on using this installation as your main computer you might want to reinstall with the ubuntu 12.04 Desktop version, might be a bit easier for someone who is \"new\" to linux\n\nA: You can Run Firefox through Terminal using just single word command\nsyn :\n     firefox\n\nTo open any other page through it, just do it like\nSyn :\n    firefox <Domain Name>\n\nExample :\n    firefox http://www.google.com\n\nThis is to open google.com through firefox.\nIf you have not properly installed firefox just type command in terminal like\nSyn :\nSudo apt-get install firefox.\n\nAnd Enter your password.\n", "Q: Where should I place my sqlite database for proper packaging?

Maybe I can place the whole structure in the debian folder?  \n\nA: If the database stores user-settings, it should go into ~/.config/<app>/.  If you want to ship a copy with the default settings, that should go into /opt/ with your other files, and get copied into ~/.config/<app>/ the first time the user runs your app.\n/etc/ should only be used for storing system-wide settings, not user settings or defaults.\n", "Q: Error when importing pynotify When i add \nimport pynotify\n\nand try to run my app i get\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gobject/constants.py:24: Warning: g_boxed_type_register_static: assertion `g_type_from_name (name) == 0' failed\n  import gobject._gobject\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gtk-2.0/gtk/__init__.py:40: Warning: specified class size for type `PyGtkGenericCellRenderer' is smaller than the parent type's `GtkCellRenderer' class size\n  from gtk import _gtk\n/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/gtk-2.0/gtk/__init__.py:40: Warning: g_type_get_qdata: assertion `node != NULL' failed\n  from gtk import _gtk\n\nwith another example i don't get the error...\n\nA: You should only use pynotify if you are using Gtk2.

The content in a big variety of forms. We would be able to define a simple outline of a maths course. Perhaps just by creating a set of tags or nested categories representing the different topics covered. Then we could classify any relevant content we have by linking it to the tags/categories. We could do the same for the other school's course.\nA user would be able to browse and search through all the different content of every type from one interface. Allowing them to easily find learning or teaching materials. \nThere would ideally be a fair amount of flexibility and overlap in the system. So if we say that one course is the maths section of a certain country's curriculum, then a user could find the content relating to it by browsing by country, then subject, then grade level (advanced/beginner) and then individual mathematical topic (depending how detailed the classifications are), but they could also browse first by grade level, then subject, and see all the maths content for every country.\nIt would also be great if content could be indexed and searched. And this would all have to be done locally.\nAlthough I've mentioned courses and schools a lot, the software would basically just be classification and search/browsing, not course or curriculum management software.\nIs there any software that would be able to build up this sort of structue? I'm sure something similar could be achieved through tools like sharepoint but this would be run on individual machines, not on a network so I'd like a ubuntu desktop app.\nI have a feeling I'm missing something obvious here or just thinking about this in entirely the wrong way...\nEDIT:\nThe machines are currently running edubuntu with some extra software and content added.\nAlso, if a tool for this does not exist, then development is a possibility. In fact, I'd rather like to take it on as a project for my final year in college, but I wanted to see if there's any existing software that could solve the problem first.\nEDIT NUMBER 2:\nLooking around a bit more I see more similarities between what I want and various tools like existing Enterprise Content Management Systems, Document Management Systems and also web CMS. All of them seem like fairly weighty options though and in the case of things like the document management systems I'm not sure how simple they can be made to use.\nDo you think any of them would be flexible enough to give this level of classification and also have a really simple end-user interface. Of course it would still be much better to have a proper desktop application than running a webserver, database server and app on top, as these would be very low spec computers.\nThis would have to be usable by people with very low levels of computer literacy (third world deployments)\n\nA: If they already have contents in Computer , the only Solution i can Suggest is , Set up A Local Web Server , with Index page Containing all the links linked to data on Computer. \nSo for different Courses , Different such pages defining such Content can be achieved. \nI personally don't think there is any such Graphical software solution ready made in Ubuntu , you can try developing such through Quickly.

If so, I can help out there for sure.\nOne thing I would recommend is not to use VM simply because you lose a lot of functionality. If you're only trying it, or running a quick thing, you may want to consider a dual boot - it's always good to have a backup plan, also you could just use a live install on a USB stick, you get 4 GB and for small things, you're set.

Most articles suggest that configuring two X servers to run on a a single video card is more problematic than running them on separate cards and requires some trickery like using nested X servers etc. Which lead me to thinking that you don't really need two separate X sessions - all you need is to open 2 Minecraft instances and somehow bind a keyboard and a mouse to each of them. So I searched for different keywords and found this question: How to lock one mouse/keyboard pair to each screen? - the accepted answer describes an interesting approach with running 2 separate virtual machines in VMWare (I think VirtualBox may work too) and configuring USB filters for each of the VMs to only accept input from one keyboard and mouse. The OP also states that the solution worked for him.

But now, I noticed that apt-get won't install anything. I wanted to install rvm (for ruby) and therefore I needed a few packages (build-essential and curl to be precise). But if I tried to install them, I always get the message that there is no installcandidate for that package... .\nWhat can I do to get apt-get working again?\n\nA: You deleted apt-get's list of available packages, so it thinks that no packages exist and it is alone in this world :)\nJust run sudo apt-get update to repopulate the lists, and then sudo apt-get install ... will work again.\n", "Q: Where can I find blueprints and a roadmap for multiarch in 12.10? Multiarch came a long way in 12.04.  However, the 32-bit release is still recommended for download and some 32-bit debs (Google Chrome for example) still lack dependencies.  I have not been able to find any blueprints dealing with multiarch for 12.10.

How do I enable Middle mouse button emulation in 12.04 LTS?\nI think it was disabled by default in the last release. I'm sure this is a silly question but I can't find a generic answer, they all seem to be touchpad specific (ie, multi-touch related, which I don't have), or using what I consider not to be normal ubuntu methods (creating xorg.conf file).

You may put gpointing-device-settings in auto-start but still need to prompt then. I am not aware of any proper config solution.\nProbably some steps need a sudo or root access. I assume you know.\nHowever, now I can use the unixish copy paste by mark and middle mouse button. At least in terminal.\nAnd for the Marble Mouse there is a separate article with a lot of config details.\nAddendum\nWith Ubuntu 17 and in XFCE the middle mouse button copy paste did not work at all.\nWayland is different.\nSometimes it is helpful to enter\ngsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.mouse middle-button-enabled true\n\nWith some luck it is persistent. Else try to create a start script.\n\nA: Adding to @rubo77's answer and based on the output of your synclient you should try:\nsynclient ClickFinger3=2\n\nThen you can use a 3 finger tap to activate the middle button click.

I wish to select photos from the default event directories, and move them into a custom event directory like shown in this tutorial. Then I want to export the group of photos to a specific folder or USB stick. How do I do this?\nOr to the same ends, how can I export a tagged group of photos to a target directory?\n\nA: There are numerous ways to export a group of pictures selected in Shotwell.\nThe file pane at the left hand side of the application window is a virtual library  with a directory structure and folder names that do not map directly to the system's file directories. This can throw you off if you're coming from windows because the photo managers I've used there display a file directory identical to the system file directory, so you can drag and drop pictures to move the files around.\nWith Shotwell it's a bit more involved; Here's how to do it:\nFirst create the group of pictures you wish to move about your file system -- here is a short, screenshot-laden tutorial for two ways of doing that: http://www.linuceum.com/Desktop/Shotwell.php -- but to make things flow, I'll add a method not mentioned in the linked tutorial: flags.\nNavigate through your Shotwell directories, and flag the photos you want to include in the group of pictures you wish to move. Do this by right clicking the thumbnail, and selecting 'flag' from the right-click menu. \nIn the file pane towards the top you will see a directory named \"flagged.\" Click on that directory, and all the photos you've flagged will display in the viewing pane. Select all the photos--control A--and click on the 'file' menu at the top of left of the screen. Select Export...and a dialog will pop up, which ends with the file manager's file choosing screen, where you can choose or create the directory to where you wish to move the selected photos. That's it.\nI should note that you aren't actually moving the photos. You are but creating copies of them.   \n\nA: *\n\n*Select one or more photos.\n\n*SHIFT + CTRL + E to export, from the FAQ.\n\n*Select a target directory.\n\n", "Q: Can't install a 64-bit virtualbox on 64-bit 12.04 I have freshly installed 64 bit Win 7 and 12.04 Ubuntu dual boot machine (via a wubi install). I verified that Wubi installed 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04 and I specifically downloaded and installed the 64-Bit virtualbox package from this page on the VirtualBox website.\nUbuntu 12.04 LTS (\"Precise Pangolin\")  i386 |  AMD64\n(NOTE: I have a TOSHIBA  c655, with an Intel Pentium chip inside, there I selected the AMD64 as instructed to on the top of the page)\nWhen I run Virtualbox, it will only allow me to install and run 32 Bit guests (32 bit Win 7, to be specific). \nI'm utterly frustrated at this point. I click on \"AMD 64\", but apparently it is only installing 32-bit. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nA: 64-bit mode requires certain hardware virtualization features in your CPU. As one of the comments states, you may be able to enable these in the BIOS (they are sometimes disabled by default for security reasons).\nSome CPU units do not have the required features, or the motherboard they are installed on refuses to enable them.\nUnless you have a need to allocate more than 4GB of RAM to a single process in your guest VM, 64-bit offers little advantage over the 32-bit version.\nDo cat /proc/cpuinfo | egrep '(vmx|svm)' on your host system ; you will need at least one of these flags to support 64-bit mode guests.\n\nA: Have you tried installing Virtual Box via the Ubuntu Software Center? It should automatically select the right build (32/64) for your system.\n(it's virtualbox with no spaces if you type it in the search field)\n", "Q: Should I install Ubuntu 32-bit or 64-bit on a Dell Inspiron Mini 1012 netbook? My machine is a dell inspiron mini 1012,it has a 1 gb memory. I have installed ubuntu 11.10 on it, but it works very slow. now I want to install 12.04 and I want to know which configuration is better for my computer according with its memory, 32 bits or64 bits. I only want my computer to work faster.\nI dont know if this information is enough , if you want more info tell me.\n\nA: For a 1GB system, the best to do is install the 32 Bit version, unless you want to upgrade your system memory in the near future.  The 32 Bit works better with most of low memory systems. Plus, you'll get better memory performance from a 32-bit version.  \nI would recommend 32bit.\n\nA: For me it's enough, Dell Inspiron Mini 1012 has Intel Atom N450, which is a 1-core 64-bit Intel processor, so little bit faster should be a 64-bit OS. But the difference from my point of view isn't very big.\nFrom: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/32bit_and_64bit\n\nWhich Should I Choose?\nUnless you have specific reasons to choose\n32-bit, we recommend 64-bit to utilise the full capacity of your\nhardware.\n\nNevertheless, as Mitch answered and on this question on Stackoverflow, you may encounter some shortage of memory during some operations, so I think, that, yeah, faster would be a 64-bit Ubuntu, but when you encounter greedy applications, it will become much slower then. So for fast listening music, watching movies etc. I still recommend 64-bit, but to process videos and using gimp, etc. memory is much bigger issue, so than 32-bit.\n", "Q: How to use \"quickly run\" and pass command-line arguments?

I have Windows XP with Wubi installed.  Now I want to remove Windows XP and upgrade the Wubi install to a full installation.  How can I do that without a USB stick or a CD?\n\nA: \nI want to remove Windows XP and upgrade the Wubi install to a full installation.\n\nWhich means you want to keep all your installed applications and settings of Wubi install of Ubuntu in full installation, and I'm afraid its not possible, since Wubi installation within Windows creates a virtual filesystem in a single .disk (not sure of this extension) file in Ubuntu's installation folder within Windows, which will be of the size that you chose from the installer during Wubi installation, while full installation involves having a dedicated partition (of type EXT4 or btrfs) specifically for Ubuntu.\nYou can still keep application settings of existing Ubuntu installation by copying every file and folder from your home directory and pasting it back to same place in new installation (only recommended if version of Ubuntu is same in both old and new installation). Also, you may want to look into your /etc directory and save the configurations of certain software packages.\nHence, if you want to completely drop your Windows XP and use Ubuntu full-time then, a clean install is much viable option for you. You can get a complete PDF guide on installing and using Ubuntu 12.04 here (includes screenshots and dead simple to understand).\n", "Q: Openstack Dashboard access after installing w\\ MAAS I've installed MAAS and Openstack as guided by\nhttps://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/MAAS/\nand\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuCloudInfrastructure, however on step 5 it states:\n\nif you are using this to deploy OpenStack on a IaaS for testing\n  purposes, the last step is to expose the services that should be made\n  available to outside requests, opening the required firewall ports in\n  the security group. This is obviously not needed when deploying using\n  MAAS.\n\nQuite frankly it's not obvious how this is intended to work - I don't know how to access the Openstack dashboard. I ran these commands: juju expose openstack-dashboard and \njuju expose nova-cloud-controller per the guide, however juju status openstack-dashboard still does not yield an address for me to go to.  I've tried hitting the ip's of my (hardware) nodes to see if it's living out there somewhere, but got nowhere.\n\nA: When Juju gives you the public-adress: 367pb.cluster01.yourdomain.com style address, you have at add /horizon onto the end of that to get to the web interface page.\nAll authentication is handled by keystone.  You need to ensure there is a relation between the  openstack-dashboard and keystone services. You should be able to access the dashboard (initially) using username 'admin' and the password that was set for the 'admin-password' in the keystone section of the configuration you passed to 'juju deploy'.  If you forgot to specify the configuration when deploying keystone, one was randomly generated for you by the charm.  You should be able to find this in /var/lib/keystone/keystone.passwd on the keystone node.\nHope that helps.\n", "Q: Unity Launcher integration and quickly run... fail I'm trying to use the uniy launcher with progress bar.. but it doesn't work..\nI just followed the first example on http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqGfsgz1Sl4&list=UUWUDCz-Q0m4qK7lkK4CevQA&index=4&feature=plcp and watched the code of the hello-unity ppa ... trying integration in my apps.. and it doesn't work.\nWhat I did:\n\n\n*\n\n*added from gi.repository import Unity;\n\n*added self.launcher = Unity.LauncherEntry.get_for_desktop_id (\"protoborsa.desktop\") in the init code of my window application.\n\n*added launcher.set_property(\"progress\", 0.42) after my application is displayed\n\n*added launcher.set_property(\"progress_visible\", True) after my application is displayed\n\n\nand nothing happened after quickly run...\nI tried to follow this also..\nHow do I make the launcher progress bar work with my application? but it didn't work for me.\nmany thanks.\n\nA: I don't know why but now, after I've copied the file myproject.desktop.in (myproject is the name of the quickly project) inside the project folder in ~/.local/share/applications/myproject.desktop, it works. \n", "Q: Downloading software within ubuntu When I go into Ubuntu Software center and download software it will say download complete but when i search for it on the pc to open it its nowhere to be found, I figured it would go into dash home but its nowhere to be found.

My Default Unity session is too heavy to my laptop now (4 years old machine) and it's constantly hanging. I installed the fallback session to get more responsiveness of the whole system, but now i don't have a global menu, and by that, I lose some screen space..minimal, but I still want them... Is that a solution for this?\n\nA: You can get this by installing the indicator-applet-appmenu  package in the Software Center, Synaptic, or with apt-get.\nI had to log out an back in to get it to show up in my list of panel widgets to add.\n\nA: I know this is an old question, but still valid (top Google result) and I might add a useful detail to Ian and Eliah's answer.\nThe indicator-applet-appmenu pointed out above is excellent, but by itself it doesn't fully replace the functionality you find in Unity: with the indicator-applet-appmenu, a maximized window still has its own title bar, whereas in Unity the global menu doubles as title bar (depending on whether the mouse is hovering on it or not), which saves a little extra vertical space.\nSomething very close can be achieved with an extra tweak: add the indicator-applet-appmenu to the top Gnome panel, then configure that panel to auto-hide. Like that, if the active window is maximized, its title bar will occupy the very top of the screen,  making better use of vertical space; but, if the mouse touches the top edge of the screen, the top panel will slide down, revealing the application's menu.\nDisabling \"Expand\" in the top panel's properties can also be useful, as it will prevent the panel from sliding on top of the window's close/minimize/maximize buttons, which can be annoying.\n", "Q: dpkg stuck downloading font files I have been reinstalling Ubuntu 12.04.

I wouldn't want to upgrade if there is a problem in the last version\nbut I don't know much about Ubuntu so, can anyone help me please?\nThank you!!\n\nA: Make a backup of your sources file before editing it.\nsudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/sources.list.bak\n\nNext, run this command to remove the offending line:\nsudo su -c \"cat /etc/apt/sources.list.bak | grep -v 'extras.ubuntu' > /etc/sources.list\"\n\nBe sure not to make any typos.\n\nA: I finally found the answer. Software updates/other/ uncheck the checkmarks from the top three - in my case that was CD and unsupported. Then I ran a check again, and voila! Software up to date. Previously it kept saying 97 days ago etc. (today it said 99 days). \nP.S. I got the answer from a forum for Ubuntu 13.04, which I do not have (I'm running 12.04).

I need some method to block the entire Internet other then a few sites on my 'whitelist'. I am looking for a solution that is not browser specific - so no add-ons/plugin suggestions please. Is there any file within the system or some Command to run in the terminal that will allow me to do this ? \n\nA: You can consider Privoxy, available from the Ubuntu Software Center. It's a proxy server that may do what you want.\nSection 3.27 has this:\n\n3.27. Can I set-up Privoxy as a whitelist of \"good\" sites?\nSure. There are a couple of things you can do for simple\n  white-listing. Here's one real easy one:\n############################################################  \nBlacklist\n  \n  ######################################################\n  \n  { +block }  / # Block all URLs\n############################################################  \nWhitelist\n  \n  ######################################################\n  \n  { -block }\n  kids.example.com\n  toys.example.com\n  games.example.com\n  This allows access to only those three sites by first blocking all URLs,\n  and then subsequently allowing three specific exceptions.\nAnother approach is Privoxy's trustfile concept, which incorporates\n  the notion of \"trusted referrers\". See the Trust documentation for\n  details.\nThese are fairly simple approaches and are not completely foolproof.\n  There are various other configuration options that should be disabled\n  (described elsewhere here and in the User Manual) so that users can't\n  modify their own configuration and easily circumvent the whitelist.\n\n", "Q: Problems with making a bootable USB Drive on a Mac I am following these instructions to create a Bootable USB Drive for me Mac and this is the output I get on step 8.\nnew-host:~ Jason$ sudo dd if=/Users/Jason/Desktop/ubuntu-12.04-desktop-amd64.dmg of=/dev/rdisk1s2 bs=1m\ndd: /dev/rdisk1s2: Invalid argument\n691+1 records in\n691+0 records out\n724566016 bytes transferred in 164.544659 secs (4403461 bytes/sec)\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nA: You should use unetbootin it is SO MUCH EASIER just reformat your disk and then throw the iso onto the flashdrive using unetbootin. http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/\n\nA: Dang! I might take a look at that. I made a 12.04 Live-USB for my Macbook 1.2, late 2007. It helped to have a working Live-CD so I could check Linux names for the USB stick, and so on. I used the instructions at ubuntu.com for making a Live-CD, but had to burn the disk 4-5 times before I got one that worked reliably.\nI could NOT make a Live-USB following the directions at ubuntu.com. They may work for newer Macbooks, but not mine. I found a link to these instructions. Then I messed around with the grub.cfg file for days before I got:\n# grub.cfg for MB1,2 USB Install F11\n\n# Timeout for menu\n\ntimeout=20\n\ndefault=0\n\nmenuentry \"UBUNTU USB\" {\n\n       echo\n       echo \"FAKEBIOS\"\n       fakebios\n\n       echo\n       echo \"SET ROOT\"\n\n       #set prefix=(hd1,2)/boot/grub\n       #set root=(hd0,1)\n\n       set root=(hd1,2)\n\n       #set root=(hd1,2)/boot/grub \n       #echo\n\n       #echo \"INSMOD\"\n       #insmod (hd1,2)/boot/grub/linux.mod\n\n       echo\n       echo \"LINUX\"\n       linux /vmlinuz root=/dev/sdb2 video=efifb agp=off\n\n       echo\n       echo \"INITRD\"\n       initrd /initrd.img\n\n       echo\n       echo \"IMPLIED BOOT\"\n}\n\nI found the echos very helpful. It gets all the way up to the implied boot and almost finishs, but failed mounting things on root, like /dev on /root/dev. I played around with the 'root=' arg on the linux command until hit on the one that there. I left a bunch of other stuff in comments. They didn't work for me, but they might for you.\nI didn't find much out there. I even found a claim the Macbooks can't boot from a USB stick. I hope this helps.\n", "Q: See what Ubuntu1 folders are shared I have several folders in my Ubuntu1 folder that I have shared to various people, and I can't remember which folders are shared with which people.

So I go to the installation process, and click the first option there \" Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7\". Then I proceed to the next screen where I´m supposed to allocate drive space for the Ubuntu installation. Problem is, it only gives me the option to select my sdc drive, which is one of my storage HDD´s. I can´t choose my sda drive, which is where I have Windows 7 installed.\nIf I click on the third Install Option, \"Something Else\", all 3 HDD´s are being detected correctly...\nAnyone can help me with this? Would be very grateful! Thanks a lot.\nEDIT**\nSo basically, with just my main 160gb HD plugged in, it let me install on it just fine; If I connect both that and my 320gb HD, it only allow me to choose the 320gb one; If I plug all 3, it only allow me to choose the 500gb one this time. It´s like once there is more than 1 HD connected, It won´t let me install on the one with Windows 7 already installed.\nAgain, thank you for the help!\n\nA: The Install Ubuntu alongside Windows 7 option is for install Ubuntu in the Windows partition, so it's fine that you can't see the others HDs. For what do you wanna to do, you have to select the Something Else option and install in the partition that you want.\nIn this page you will have step by step all the information for install Ubuntu & Windows with dual-boot.\n\nA: You'll need to select the 3rd option where you select all the partitions yourself and then it should automatically set aside some space for you in the unallocated area.\n\nA: If you just want simple, try simple.\nCan you disable (or unplug) the other 2 HDDs first?\n", "Q: Switchable laptop graphics issues on Ubuntu 12.04? I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 on a Lenovo Z570 laptop with Intel HD 3000 integrated graphics, and a switch to enable the dedicated GT630M graphics card. I've been having issues in general with my graphics drivers and whatnot.\nUbuntu's system settings say that it can't detect any graphics driver (it lists 'Unknown'), although the quality graphics including fade effects, Unity 3D, etc. tell me that one of the cards must be functioning just fine. My decent unplugged battery life suggests that the dedicated graphics is disabled (plus I Googled a solution that allowed me to force the external card off on boot, sorry but I can't remember what I did or where I found it). In Windows, I can hit a switch to toggle the dedicated graphics on and off, along with an indicator light, but that feature doesn't work in Ubuntu and the light remains on no matter what.\nSecondly, I'd like to get the proper drivers installed for maximum performance (if they matter). In an earlier installation of 12.04, I tried to install the NVIDIA driver and ended up screwing up my resolution so bad that I just had to reinstall Ubuntu. I'm not even sure if the Intel integrated graphics need a driver to function properly.\nSorry if I'm being a bit confusing; this is more of a general issue than a precise question, but if I could get some answers to these questions it would be great:\n1) Is there any way I can detect for certain whether or not the dedicated GT630M is being used?\n2) Is there any way I can enable the ability to switch between the cards?\n3) Which driver(s) should I install, and how can I go about doing that? When I tried to install the NVIDIA driver, I ended up going through a whole bunch of command-line stuff that I really didn't understand just to get the installation to work, then I just smashed enter at all of the installation prompts because I hardly understood any of them.\n\nA: I have the exact same Nvidia Geforce GT 630M in my laptop. The solution is basically run these commands:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia\n\nThen when you need 3D graphics for a program, run it as optirun program. To save power on laptops, it runs only that single program through your nvidia graphics card. To start nvidia-settings, run this optirun nvidia-settings -c :8\nUnfortunately, Nvidia doesn't officially support these hybrid cards on Linux.
